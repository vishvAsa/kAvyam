      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://monk.gallery/interviews/arun-yogiraj/&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Arun Yogiraj: Still Life&lt;br&gt;&#xA;APRIL 2022 Sophia Ann French MONK&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I WAS BORN into a Christian-Muslim home in India to parents who encouraged my curiosity for theology and ontology, and I began visiting temples in my teens, entranced by the magnitude of design in even the smallest shrines in India. Sculpting mūrtis is a ceremonial act, and the shilpi (sculptor) has to bring imagination to life using complex mathematical measurements prescribed in the Vedic canon. The mūrtis in Indian temples are spiritual and metaphysical metaphors that offer an experience of detached bliss to the sculptor and the audience. This measured artistry of Indian traditional sculpture gives every mūrti distinct energy and lifeforce, and no two idols look or feel alike.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
