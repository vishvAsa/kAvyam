IT IS A FACT that we have neglected the *Samskrita Kavya* of modern times. Except Dr. V. Raghavan's booklet on contemporary Sanskrit literature, no good and authentic work on the said topic is available either in English or in any of the regional languages of India. The general public and the students of Samskrita are unaware of the fact that there are a good number of people amongst us who can speak, think and write in Samskrita. Now the time has come for the Samskritists to declare that they are living.

The causes for such a state of affair are many. To take the example of Karnataka, there is not even a single Library or a Book-shop entirely devoted to Samskrita. No modern work is prescribed in any of the schools or colleges even to those students who offer Samskrita as one of their special subjects. Even in Post-graduate courses not a single word will be uttered on this subject. To be brief—the existence of contemporary Samskrita poets is quite unheard of. 

But for the devoted efforts of Sri K. N. Varadaraja Iyengar, Editor "*Sudharma*", most of the people, methinks, would have doubted the *Svarupa Yogyata* of Samskrita. The fact that even under these circumstances there are thousands of people who are engaged in [[P4]]

composing Samskrita Kavyas is a thing to be appreciated. In case, some encouragement is given, I am sure, these poets will show not only that they are not inferior to the poets of other languages but they can even surpass them.

It is under the said circumstances that a few Sahrudayas in Bangalore have ventured to start the Surabharathi Prakashanam devoted to the publication of modern writings in Samskritha. It is our earnest appeal to the general public and the Sanskritists to encourage us to serve the cause of Samskrita.

It is a matter of great pleasure for the publisher to publish *Anantha Bharati*—a compilation of Samskritha writings of Dr. Anantha Krishna Sharma. Dr. Sharma (84) is wellknown in the fields of music and Telugu literature. But only a few people know that he is also a Samskrita poet of original talent and who has written a champu, a few poems, many articles and a number of kirtanas in Samskritha. His "*Mahisurarajyabhyudayadarshah*" written in the year 1925 brought him the first prize in the competition conducted by H H Nalmadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar, the then Maharaja of Mysore. When I approached Dr. Sharma to bless and permit us to reprint his Samskritha writings he readily

accepted and blessed whole heartedly. The next thing was to collect his Samskrita writings most of which have already been lost. Dr. Sharma was the only resort and he actually dictated a few poems from his memory. But alas! I could not get his writings in entirely.

Afterwards I requested the various institutions which have published Dr. Sharma's writings in their journals. They have graciously permitted me to reproduce those articles. My thanks are due to Dr. V. Raghavan, Director, The Kuppaswami Sastri Research Institute, Madras and the Registrar, Sri Venkateswara University, Tirupathy for their timely co-operation. I need not, say anything about our gratitude to Dr. R Anantha Krishna Sharma. My thanks are also due to Sri H. V. Nagaraja Rao, Sri G. Aswathanarayan & Sri C. R. Ranganatha Rao for their timely help.

I will be failing in my duties if I do not prostrate before Sri K. N. Varadaraja Iyengar, Editor of Sudharma who is the main source of inspiration for this. His generous help in this regard, the untiring efforts of Sree Kantha Power Press, particularly its Manager Sri K. S. Seshadri is indeed ineffable.
