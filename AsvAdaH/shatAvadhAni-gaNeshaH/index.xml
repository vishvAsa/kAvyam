      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.prekshaa.in/Sanskrit-Poetry-Epic-Play-Champu&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a short list of poetic works in Sanskrit. Most of the works included here are well known to our literary tradition. This list is divided into two parts: The first part keeps in mind a lover of Sanskrit poetry who might not actively compose verses in the language. The second part comprises works that a budding Sanskrit poet who is serious about his passion ought to read. Needless, the first part is a must-read for budding poets as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
