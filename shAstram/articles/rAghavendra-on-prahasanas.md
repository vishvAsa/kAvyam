## Introduction
Prahasana as a genre has a unique place not just in Sanskrit drama but even in all of classical Sanskrit literature. Prahasana is one among the ten types of rūpakas (plays) and it mainly deals with satirical humour, which not only entertains the rasikas but also gives a light-hearted perspective of the society and practices prevalent in the era when they were composed. In the guise of humour, they offer serious criticism of social happenings.+++(5)+++ A superficial reading of a prahasana might not reveal this illuminating dimension, for the critiques are suggestive.

Matta-vilāsa-prahasanam and Bhagavad-ajjukam are two of the finest prahasanas. Both have seen multiple editions (some critically edited considering multiple available manuscripts), have been staged, and have been critically analyzed. The focus of the present essay is a critical appreciation of these two plays from the perspective of the rasika or the sahṛdaya.

Dr. S. Ramaratnam’s thesis "Prahasana in Sanskrit Literature" covers many aspects about prahasanas in a comprehensive manner.+++(5)+++ Our focus being the rasika, details about the characteristics of prahasanas, their origin, and many other technical details that may be important for thoroughness are beyond the scope of this essay and have already been elaborated by Dr. Ramaratnam.

## Dramas
Poetry is divided into śravya (that which is heard/read) and dṛśya (that which is seen). Drama comes under drśya-kāvya and is often hailed as the highest form of poetry. Statements—such as "nāṭakāntaṃ hi sāhityam" and "kāvyeṣu nāṭakaṃ ramyam"— sprinkled across Sanskrit treatises bear testimony to this fact. Kālidāsa in his Mālavikāgnimitram says that it is a yajña for the/through the eyes, which alludes to the very basic tenet of a yajña which is unifying and sharing. The statement "prayogatvam anāpanne kāvye nāsvāda-sambhavaḥ" goes even further stating that poetry that can't be performed cannot be savoured at all.+++(4)+++ To borrow a modern analogy, a movie based on a novel has a greater audience than the novel itself. While great poets like Kālidāsa have composed extraordinary poems, they have earned the highest appreciation due to the dramas they have composed. It is owing to the dramas he wrote that Bhavabhūti is spoken with the same reverence as that of Kālidāsa. Kālidāsa wonders whether people will accept his new play Mālavikāgnimitram since there have already been great dramas of yore from Bhāsa, Saumilla etc. However, he hardly has similar misgivngs about whether his poetry will be accepted despite the existence of past-masters such as Vyāsa, Vālmīki, Aśvagoṣa etc. (He does confess his inability describing the illustrious kings of the raghu-vaṃśa but he doesn’t compare himself with other poets before him.)

With such importance given to the genre of drama, one will naturally wonder what its purpose might be. Is it to educate people? Make them familiar with stories of the past? Bring change in the society? A revolution perhaps? While these things might happen inadvertently, the main purpose of drama or any literature for that matter is to evoke rasa in the connoisseurs. As the saying goes, "nahi rasādrte kaścid arthaḥ pravartate". There is no higher purpose than rasa.+++(5)+++ 

Rasa being the foremost objective, the next question is – What is meant by rasa and how many are there? There are traditionally eight rasas. Śṛṅgāra, Hāsya, Raudra, Karuṇa, Bībhatsa, Bhayānaka, Vīra, and Adbhuta (some sources give Śānta as the ninth rasa). For a comprehensive treatment of these concepts one can refer to Bharatiya Kavyamimamse by Ti Nam Srikantaiah in Kannada, V Raghavan's illuminating exposition “The Number of Rasas” also gives a detailed analysis.+++(4)+++ Out of these, the prahasana mainly deals with Hāsya. Some related details can also be found in Ramaratnam’s thesis.

## Hāsya in Sanskrit literature
Hāsya[1] which can be found right from the vedic passages - lampooning the chanting of the vedas themselves which is being compared to the croaking of frogs - has been constantly present in even the most profound and serious literature in Sanskrit. Since then Sanskrit poets have employed Hāsya in their works. While some examples can be found in Ramaratnam’s thesis, some more interesting episodes which have been left out are mentioned here.

### Rāmayaṇa
Rāmayaṇa has its own share of Hāsya, and that appears in and around many grave and poignant situations, Rāma who had just lost his kingdom and is about to go to the forest,  gives away his belongings to the poor and needy. A poor brāhmaṇa called Trijaṭa asks him for cows, Rāma in such grave situation jovially asks him to throw his staff and collect all the cows in that range where the staff falls. Trijaṭa fastens up his garments and prepares himself like a javelin thrower and throws his staff with all his might which falls on the banks of Sarayu, Rāma happily gives him all the cows as promised. Even in such a dire situation this episode lightens the gravity and also gives us a peek into Rāma’s equanimity (Vālmīki Rāmayana, Ayodhya kāṇḍa 2.32.29-2.32.43). Later the people of Ayodhya who are treated with festivities in the āśrama of Bharadvāja declares

> नैवायोध्यां गमिष्यामो  
> गमिष्यामो न दण्डकान्।
> कुशलं भरतस्यास्तु  
> रामस्यास्तु तथा सुखम्।।2.91.60।।

that they’d stay there itself, they’d neither go to Ayodhya nor Daṇḍaka and wish both Rāma and Bharata prosperity and happiness. Around 20-25 verses which follow are also a treat! The context here is graver, Daśaratha is no more, Bharata wants to bring back Rāma to Ayodhya. Next we again see Hāsya’s appearance in the sargas 61-62 of the Sundara kāṇḍa during the destruction of the Madhuvana by the monkeys elated after finding Sītā, just few verses from there is enough to substantiate the claim!

> उन्मत्तभूताः प्लवगा  
> मधुमत्ताश्च हृष्टवत्।  
> क्षिपन्ति च तथान्योन्यं  
> स्खलन्ति च तथाऽपरे।।5.62.12।।  
> केचित् क्ष्वेलां प्रकुर्वन्ति  
> केचित् कूजन्ति हृष्टवत्।  
> हरयो मधुना मत्ताः  
> केचित् सुप्ता महीतले।।5.62.13।।  
> कृत्वा केचिद्-धसन्त्यन्ये  
> केचित् कुर्वन्ति चेतरत्।  
> कृत्वा केचिद् वदन्त्य् अन्ये  
> केचिद् बुध्यन्ति चेतरत्।।5.62.14।।  
> जानुभिस् तु प्रकृष्टाश् च  
> देवमार्गं प्रदर्शिताः।
> अब्रुवन् परमोद्विग्ना  
> गत्वा दधिमुखं वचः।।5.62.16।।

These verses have been specifically quoted as this involves drunken antics of the monkeys, which is apt since we are about to discuss Matta-vilāsa!

### Mahābhārata
The Mahābhārata is no different though the episodes related to Hāsya are few and far. Bhima’s childhood antics are sure to invoke some laughs, so does Uttarakumāra’s boasting in Virāṭa Parva followed by Bṛhannalā’s antics (Mahābhārata Virāṭa Parva Critical Text BORI, sargas 34-36) which has been utilized well by the later poets like Kumāravyāsa, who wrote in Kannada.

### Kālidāsa
Kālidāsa also masterfully inserts Hāsya in all his dramas through the behavior of the vidūṣaka in Mālavikāgnimitram, Vikramorvaśīyam, Abhijñānaśākuntalam. The episode of the fisherman and how he is treated before and after his meeting of Duṣyanta by the royal guards in Abhijñānaśākuntalam is also noteworthy.+++(4)+++

The overall attitude of our poets regarding Hāsya can be well-summarised by quoting a famous verse from one of the four bhāṇas, Pādatāḍitakam by Śyāmilaka in the Caturbhāṇī.

> न प्राप्नुवन्ति यतयो रुदितेन मोक्षं  
> स्वर्गायतिं न परिहासकथा रुणद्धि  
> तस्मात् प्रतीत-मनसा हसितव्यम् एव  
> वृत्तिम् बुधेन खलु कौरुकुचीं विहाय+++(5)+++
> 
> [The sages don’t attain the mukti by lamenting continuously, nor do the gates of svarga stop someone who indulges in laughter and mirth. Therefore the wise should always leave inhibitions and happily laugh with clear minds and lighten themselves.]
> 
> Pādatāḍitakam verse 5


## The nature of prahasanas
While prahasanas in general and Matta-vilāsa in particular lacks the sublimity or profundity of ārśa-kāvyas like the Rāmayana and the Mahābhārata, the poetry and dramas of Bhāsa, Kālidāsa, Bhavabhūti, Śūdraka, Viśākhadatta, it still stands the test of time precisely because it deals with the society and human psyche, the more it changes the more it remains the same. 

While Mṛcchakaṭika, a prakaraṇa, deals with contemporary theme and thus remains relevant to us, so do these prahasanas albeit for a different reason. In Mṛcchakaṭika the focus is on the individual characters but many events happening in the society are placed in the backdrop and they are suggested instead of having them in the forefront.+++(5)+++ A similar thing can be observed here where the degeneration of society is hinted at in a suggestive manner but not directly brought to the forefront. This follows the tried and tested way of treating the audience as not just people but as connoisseurs who would pick such suggestions with ease.

While the other play in discussion - Bhagavad-ajjukam - has a supernatural thread intertwined, Matta-vilāsa happens entirely in the realm of reality and so it instantly connects to connoisseurs of any era, with minimum modifications if necessary. At the same time, just because it deals with the society it doesn’t become a documentary which is so bound to reality that it fails to produce rasa in a connoisseur.

## Matta-vilāsa-prahasanam
Matta-vilāsa-prahasanam is one among the first available prahasanas and also one of the best of its kind. While the plot seems trivial and none of the characters seems to have anything worthy to root for, it stands testimony to the fact that observing mundane things in a different perspective is what is required to generate humour. Unimportant things which won't even be noticed during the normal course of life, and even when noticed doesn't amount to anything profound, form the basis of the plot.+++(4)+++ The humor being situational also helps it.

A drunk kāpālika who wanders along with his partner in search of liquor, loses his begging bowl, a search operation leads to an encounter with a Buddhist monk who is accused of stealing it, a pāśupata seizes this opportunity to settle some scores with the kāpālika by acting as an arbitrator, meanwhile a lunatic who had found the bowl enters to resolve the conundrum. Thus a begging bowl lost and found leads to a comedy of errors, set in the backdrop of the city of Kāñcī gives insights to the life and society of 7th century CE.

The work in modern parlance can be called as an "equal opportunity offender" which minces no words when it comes to ridiculing practices of each of the prevalent matas including variations of the one followed by the author himself. While one can accuse Mahendravarman for not ridiculing any vaiṣṇava matas he still emerges without any blemish since he hasn’t spared his own.+++(4)+++ Even while doing so, a sense of propriety is maintained which makes this work a śuddha-prahasana in every sense (By definition a śuddha-prahasana does not involve lowly characters like eunuchs etc. Here śuddha is not just limited by that definition, the broad meaning of śuddha is taken). Such sense of propriety is rarely seen in the later prahasanas which resort to cheap vulgarity.+++(4)+++

### Earlier studies
While the prahasana has been well-studied - critical edition has been brought out by Dr N P Unni, analysed by Dr. S. Ramaratnam as a part of his thesis “Prahasanas in Sanskrit literature”, a translation along with critical notes published by Michael Lockwood and Vishnu Bhat - analysing such a work again is all the more relevant in our times because of two primary reasons. 

- The first reason is, everyone is participating in an oppression olympics where everyone gets offended at the drop of a hat. Even the alleged champions of freedom of expression dare not ridicule specific groups fearing retribution and political correctness rules supreme. In such an environment, a work of this nature should be revisited to introspect and decide where we stand. 
- The second reason is that there are some crucial things which are missing in these editions, some of them can be attributed to the limited scope in which they were prepared, but some others seem to come from entirely different and non-academic reasons.

The critical edition by Dr. N P Unni (first published in 1974) forms the basis of this analysis. The text contains details of various manuscripts available along with details of the poet, his various achievements and titles, and how the prahasana was staged mainly in accordance with the theatrical traditions in Kerala. Some of the content from Dr. S Ramaratnam’s thesis and the edition prepared by Lockwood and Bhat has been discussed wherever it is relevant. All the three editions also have a discussion about the societal conditions during the era in which the play is placed. Since it already covers most of the important points, that is also left out.

### The author
Unlike many other Sanskrit works which either keeps us in the dark about the authorship or it's time period, these pesky questions about Matta-vilāsa are settled beyond doubt. The author being Pallava Mahendravarman and the time period being the early 7th century CE. Mahendravarman was one of the greatest kings hailing from the Pallava dynasty which at its peak had a vast empire in Southern India spanning Tamil Nadu, Kerala, parts of Karnataka and Andhra. Being a king, a warrior and prevailing in the times when there were a lot of conflicts to establish supremacy over Southern India, Mahendravarman seems to have the tenacity and time to put his poetic skills to use in a delightful prahasana. Mahendravarman even though a śaiva was a patron of all the other matas prevalent, like any other king adherent to the sanātana-dharma this plurality was the rule rather than the exception. Such plurality is what has led to this work and it's subsequent preservation for fourteen centuries and counting. Imagine a work ridiculing an ideology which would enjoy the support of both the ruling class and the citizens at various time periods being preserved for posterity and celebrated in any other culture.

Further details about him can be found in both the critical edition by Dr. N P Unni.

### Dramatis Personae
Sūtradhāra (Stage manager) : Introduces the play, the author and sets the stage for the performance. Eager to stage the play to earn back his senior wife’s favour.

Naṭī (Stage manager’s wife) : Supports the Sūtradhāra in conducting the initial proceedings. When the proceedings start she is angry with the Sūtradhāra due to his dalliance with a younger co-wife.

Satyasoma (kāpālika) : The main character, a kāpālika - a follower of śaiva sect, indulges in wine and women abusing the tenets, stays in the Ekāmranātha temple. Loss of his begging bowl sets up the whole drama.

Devasomā (his partner) : Partner of Satyasoma, she has recently joined him, previously the partner of Babhrukalpa, has shown a tendency to switch loyalties in a bid to indulge in easy life.+++(4)+++

Nāgasena (bauddha-bhikṣu) : Buddhist monk who in spite of having an easy life wonders why other indulgences like wine and women are forbidden.+++(4)+++

Babhrukalpa (pāśupata) : follower of another śaiva sect, initially tries to avenge his loss by arbitrating, but finally decides to refer the matter to the court.

Unmattaka (madman) : A lunatic who has the bowl, appears to resolve the plot.

### The summary of the plot
The prahasana starts with a prologue where the stage manager (Sūtradhāra) tries to convince his senior wife (Naṭī) and involve her in presenting the play. She is angry that he has taken a new wife who is young and chides him for acting in this juvenile fashion. Only when he says that the august gathering present wants to see the play and will bless them, she is convinced and asks him what is the name and who is the author. Once that is introduced, the main plot starts with the kāpālika Satyasoma and his partner Devasomā, both intoxicated, unsteady and in need of support, wandering in the streets of Kāñcī. 

He has either due to being intoxicated or devoid of any reason, forgotten his begging bowl somewhere. Conversation starts with his comment complimenting Devasomā that she has grown beautiful in no time due to her diligence in following the vrata (which includes consuming liquor). She says the whole world is revolving and she needs support, while supporting her he commits gotraskhalana incurring her wrath. He blames the liquor and vows to abstain from it. Devasomā is aghast that she is the cause of abstinence which is against the vrata and pleads not to violate it. He is happy and bestows his benediction upon Śiva who was the first to show that path. When she says Buddhists say otherwise he criticizes it's tenets and again goes for a drink to "purify" his tongue which was sullied due to discussion about Buddhism. 

Once they reach another tavern, he compares it with various facets of yajña, which Devasomā completes by saying that they are indeed worthy of the rudrabhāga[1]. Only when the liquor is offered do they notice that the bowl is missing. Since an offering is not to be refused, they use the horn which they have for such contingencies to accept the liquor and set out to search the bowl. 

Satyasoma guesses that either a dog or a Buddhist monk would have taken it since it contained roasted meat. A Buddhist monk Nāgasena is noticed by Devasomā. He is returning to his vihāra after a sumptuous meal offered by one of the merchants, praising Buddha for allowing such indulgences like good food and luxurious places to stay, he wonders why the omniscient one has forbidden wine and women. He comes to the conclusion that it is perhaps the scheming senior monks who have come up with such ridiculous rules and he vows to find the original untainted teachings of Buddha and restore his mata to its former glory and free the monks from such tyranny. 

Called by Satyasoma he feels that it is better to escape than being the target of the drunken antics and tries to run away, which adds fuel to the suspicion of Satyasoma who gets hold of him. Satyasoma is curious to know what is hidden inside the robes and demands for it to be revealed. A fight happens and the monk, being stronger and not intoxicated, kicks him. Devasomā joins the fight to be beaten. Already having noticed how beautiful she is, he helps her get up. Satyasoma accuses him of snatching his partner away while Nāgasena says he did it out of compassion which his faith professes. 

Babhrukalpa, a pāśupata enters and sees Devasomā who was his former partner being taken away from him by Satyasoma, wants to avenge it and plans to do it by being a neutral judge, but secretly supports the other party. During his arbitration, the monk is convinced to show his bowl which is of a different colour and shape, and is accused of changing it since Buddhists are known to do such things easily. Finally it is decided that the matter is to be settled in the court. 

Devasomā is convinced that they'll lose since the monk has a lot of money which can be used to bribe the judges. Satyasoma decides being on the side of truth there is no need to be afraid, and agrees. By then a madman arrives with the bowl which he snatched from a dog, and offers it to the pāśupata who directs him to offer it to a worthy recipient. He offers it to the kāpālika and immediately changes his mind and tries to run away. He is stopped and he agrees to give it if they show him a ‘madman’. Satyasoma convinces him that there is one hiding behind the wall and tricks him into giving the bowl. Thus the bowl returns to its rightful owner and both Satyasoma and Nagasena part on amicable terms followed by the bharatavākya.

### Languages and meters
While nothing of value is added by mentioning what has been discussed by both Dr N P Unni and Dr S Ramaratnam, just for the sake of completion, here is the list of meters and languages used. Even in a small work the author has shown versatility in usage of languages and meters which can be gathered by a cursory glance of the lists below.

Metres: Anuṣṭup, Āryā, Indravajra, Rucirā, Mālinī, Vaṃśasthā, Vasantatilakā, Śārdūlavikrīḍitā, Sragdharā.

Languages: Sanskrit, Prakrits - Śaurasenī, Māgadhī.

### Critical appreciation
#### sthāpana
Mahendravarman starts with a brilliant invocatory verse

> भाषा-वेश-वपुः-क्रिया-गुण-कृतानाश्रित्य भेदान् गतं  
> भावावेश-वशाद् अनेक-रसतां त्रैलोक्य-यात्रामयम् ।  
> नृत्तं निष्प्रतिबद्ध-बोध-महिमा यः प्रेक्षकश् च स्वयं  
> स व्याप्तावनि-भाजनं दिशतु वो दिव्यः कपाली यशः॥१॥
>
> [May that divine skull-bearer (Śiva)  
> Of unfettered omniscience,  
> Himself a spectator and **performer**  
> Seized of emotions and portraying sentiments  
> Comprising the course of the three worlds  
> By speech and dress by actions and feelings  
> Grant thee glory that fills the bowl of the universe]
>
> Translation by NP Unni (modifications emphasized)

The verse can be easily used in plays which have more serious and sublime themes without batting an eyelid. The Mahānaṭa aspect of Śiva is alluded to in the verse along with the fact that he encompasses the whole universe thus being both the performer and the spectator. One can't help but be reminded of the invocatory verses from Mālavikāgnimitram, Vikramorvaśīyam, Abhijñānaśākuntalam, Mṛcchakaṭika and Mudrārākṣasa all of which incidentally invokes the same deity Śiva. While not as profound in content compared to the above mentioned verses, this verse is still a profound one by any standards, much better than many other invocatory verses employed by other poets. 

Contrast it to the invocatory verse of Svapnavāsavadattā where in a bid to bring the names of the characters using sabhanga-abhanga-śleṣa such a delicate themed play invokes Balarāma who is neither known for profundity nor such delicate emotions. Or Mālatīmādhava which invokes Gaṇapati, sneezing, and being tormented by the snake in a humorous way. One can also notice that the main character is alluded to in the invocation address to Śiva which contains one of the names of Śiva - Kapālin.

Lockwood and Bhat in their introduction (page 112) alludes to four levels of interpretation for this verse, two of which also considers Kapālin to be suggesting “king” and “playwright”. While some of the explanations are nice, getting out four interpretations seems to be a stretch and gives an impression that too much is being made out of this verse and the authors seem to walk on thin ice.+++(4)+++

In the same section and in the other sections too the authors seem to be enamoured by Tantra - the stage manager’s having a second wife for example, which wasn’t uncommon in those times is somehow construed to allude to Tantra - and find many suggestions which don't seem to add a lot in terms of rasa.+++(4)+++

Next we also notice that the faux pas committed by Satyasoma which casts doubt in the mind of his partner about his fidelity is hinted by the fact that the Sūtradhāra has married a younger woman which has angered the senior wife. She in fact chides him for such juvenile antics, in the process cleverly mentions the name of the play through pun (यौवन-गुण-भर-मत्त-विलास-प्रहसनं दर्शयितुम् आगतोऽसि?).

The junior wife is only referred in third person compounding to the confusion and results in adding fuel to her anger which is allayed only after telling that it is the pariṣad (gathering of the connoisseurs) - a feminine word - waiting to see it being staged.+++(4)+++

Mahendravarman, introduced as Śatruṣadvarganigraha, has many precedents, typically for any individual, let alone a king, the aspiration is to conquer all the six enemies - the ariṣadvarga. Even arthaśāstra which primarily deals with the material world, declares it’s aim to be indriyajaya i.e. conquest of senses.

He is also described as Kubera in munificence, which is interesting, such comparison with Kubera comes even in the Rāmayana (धनदेन समस् त्यागे) when describing the qualities of Rāma even though there are no famous episodes where Kubera acts as munificent as alluded. Somehow that image has stuck with Kubera for so many centuries. A comparison with Raghu or Śibi would have made it more appropriate. Along with the invocatary verse, the verse which further describes his qualities helps us gauge the prowess of the author in handling the majestic śārdūlavikrīḍita metre. The last verse in the sthāpana is intercepted by the dialogue of a character like it is usual in bhāsa and followed later.+++(4)+++

#### Plot begins
The main plot starts with the entry of Satyasoma along with Devasomā, their drunken antics are described immediately to convince the audience that they are extremely intoxicated. Satyasoma appreciates Devasomā that she has gained so much beauty and grace in so few days of the vrata alludes to her joining him recently, this is later confirmed when Babhrukalpa enters. Satyasoma, trying to support her, commits faux pas (gotra-skhalana), calling her by another name Somadevā, which results in anger. To convince her he vows never to drink again which makes her fall at his feet to apologise. This results in one of the best verses of the prahasana.

> पेया सुरा प्रियतमा-मुखम् ईक्षितव्यं  
> ग्राह्यः स्वभाव-ललितो विकृतश् च वेषः।  
> येनेदम् ईदृशम् अदृश्यत मोक्ष-वर्त्म  
> दीर्घायुर् अस्तु भगवान् स पिनाकपाणिः॥७॥
>
> [Take to wine and gaze at beloved’s face
> Don the natural, yet loathsome, dress
> Long lived be the Lord of pinaka bow
> Who thus proclaimed the way to Liberation]
>
> Translation by NP Unni

It is a practice in our tradition for elders to bless younger people to enjoy a long fruitful life. But here, Śiva is the highest deity for kāpālikas, not just that he is the ideal whom they try to reach, he is also the lord of time, Mahākāla, who has the ultimate control over time. He is the one who has neither birth nor death. He is the oldest and still beyond aging. In spite of all these things Satyasoma, a mere mortal, blesses that Śiva a long life! If not for anything, we should salute the sheer audacity of the character and the author who speaks through such a character. It also reflects the universal outlook and inclusiveness of Sanātana dharma. We have instances of devotees blessing the Lord in all seriousness. Eg.: Periyalvar blessing Viṣṇu.

When Devasomā interrupts to say this isn’t the way of buddhists or jains (अर्हन्त can apply to both), Satyasoma scolds them saying that they are fools who contradict their own stand by saying pain leads to pleasure while thinking that the nature of the effect is the same as that of the cause. During this and even later, it is evident that Satyasoma even though drunk and unsteady still has a sharp intellect which hasn’t been affected by the drinking, even while drunk his logic is incisive. Dejected by even uttering the ways of the buddhists he wants to purify his mouth by drinking! The audience by now would have no doubt about how convenient the tenets are which he follows!

#### Kāñcī
This is followed by a description of Kāñcī. There are many more descriptions of cities in Sanskrit literature which are better, but this short description does give an idea about how prosperous it was during those times, full of festivities. By bringing in the sound of clouds the Rainy season is hinted at, by the flowers the Spring also seems to be in mind, followed by a reference to Manmatha. The verse which follows though has something intriguing to say.

> अनतिशयम् अनन्तं सौख्यम् अप्रत्यनीकं  
> समधिगत-सतत्त्वा+++(=??)+++ मेनिरे यन् मुनीन्द्राः।  
> तद् इह निरवशेषं दृष्टम् एतत् तु चित्रं  
> यद् उत करण-भोग्यं काम-भोगात्मकं च॥९॥  
> [What those venerable sages conceive-  
They who know the truth behind-  
As bliss, unsurpassed, endless, unique.  
Here it is found all complete  
But strange it is sensual, indeed!  
To be enjoyed through the senses.]  
> Translation by NP Unni

Contrast this with the profound verse in the seventh act of Abhijñānaśākuntalam

> प्राणानाम् अनिलेन वृत्तिर् उचिता सत्कल्पवृक्षे वने  
> तोये काञ्चन-पद्म-रेणु-कपिशे धर्माभिषेक-क्रिया ।  
> ध्यानं रत्न-शिला-तलेषु विबुध-स्त्री-संनिधौ संयमो  
> यत् काङ्क्षन्ति तपोभिर् अन्य-मुनयस् तस्मिंस् तपस्यन्त्य् अमी ॥७.१२॥+++(5)+++
> 
> [In the vicinity of the wish fulfilling trees, the sages control their breaths, they perform abhiṣeka in the waters brimming with the pollen from the golden lotuses, they sit on gem studded surfaces, and exercise control over their senses in the presence of the divine beauties. Where others desire to go to enjoy the fruits of their tapas, these sages perform tapas there.]

where the sages are doing tapas in heaven, the place of enjoyment (bhoga), to attain it everyone else undergoes rigorous tapas. Here the premise is flipped on its head, by saying what the sages seek, the everlasting bliss, actually is present here itself in Kāñcī and not just that, it can and should be mandatorily enjoyed only through senses!

#### Tavern
Next we see the description of the tavern where they arrive to have another drink. The description, though in prose, gives comparison of the tavern to a yajñabhūmi.

> एष सुरापणो यज्ञवाट-विभूतिम् अनुकरोति।  
> अत्र हि ध्वजस्तम्भो यूपः। सुरा सोमः। शौण्डा ऋत्विजः। चषकाश् चमसाः। शूल्य-मांस-प्रभृतय उप-दंशा हविर्-विशेषाः।  
> मत्तवचनानि यजूंषि। गीतानि सामानि।  
> उदङ्काः स्रुवाः। तर्पोऽग्निः। सुरापणाधिपतिर् यजमानः।
>
> [The tavern is the yajñabhūmi. The signpost is the yūpa (sacrificial post). The liquor itself is soma. The drunk people are the purohitas. The drinking goblets are the camasas (bowls). The roasted meat serves as the side dish for the havis.+++(←दोषः)+++ The slurred speech is the yajus (prose) utterances. The songs are the sāman. The bags containing the liquor are the ladles. The thirst is the sacred Agni. and the owner of the tavern is the yajamāna.]+++(5)+++

Contrast this with the verse from the first act of the Veṇisamhāram by Bhaṭṭanārāyaṇa where a similar comparison occurs.

> [The four Pāṇḍava brothers are the purohitas, Hari himself is the one who conducts it and instructs them. The king Yudhiṣṭhira is the yajamāna who has taken the vow of undertaking the yajña which the war, the queen, Draupadī is the one who has taken the vow to conduct it, the kauravas are the sacrificial animals, the alleviation of the dishonour and the sorrows faced by our beloved is the result. The war instruments are played to call other kings for this ceremony.]

One can observe that the situation in Veṇisamhāram is a grim and decisive one which would result in the destruction of innumerable people and the gravity of such situation is enhanced by such a verse, the character there is the mighty Bhīma who is itching to destroy his cousins the kauravas. But while the comparison is similar, the situation here is so trivial that it makes a mockery of the seriousness of a yajña.

Thus we see two examples where subverting either the idea by flipping it on its head or subverting the situation to bring it down to a trivial level is employed effectively to generate humour.

The description of the drunken antics in the tavern doesn't add much. But the description of the liquor itself leads to a nice verse.

> Translation by NP Unni

A nice kāvya-liṅgālaṅkāra (poetic reason) is employed to say Manmatha became madya. Sneha means oil and also friendship. Solids converting into liquids due to heat and both Manmatha and liquor being intoxicating has been effectively used in this verse. Devasomā says that Śiva who always thinks about the welfare of the world would never do something which would destroy the world. Such a positive, assuring thought which would have been befitting in some profound situation, is used here in a trivial sense restricted to the only thing they currently hold dear! Liquor!.

#### Lost kapāla
Only when the liquor is offered does Satyasoma observe that he does not possess his kapāla. Devasomā suggests by Āpaddharma they can have it served in the horn. Āpaddharma or the dharma which can be followed in exceptional cases has been treated in detail in many of the dharmaśāstras and smṛtis. By this we also learn that Devasomā also seems to have some knowledge in the dharmaśāstras and smṛtis. While the pair doesn’t seem to be worried about the other dharmas to be followed, they conveniently remember the Āpaddharma portions.+++(5)+++ Again such behaviour has been used by the author to highlight the degeneracy of the era in an ironical manner. This is extended further when Satyasoma takes the title ‘kapālin’ literally and thinks that just because he has lost his kapāla he ceases to be ‘kapālin’. Though he realizes his folly in the very next instance.

While ‘kapālin’ is taken in literal sense before the word Pāṇigrahaṇa which literally just means holding hands is turned to the other meaning, taking one’s hand in marriage derived by lakṣaṇa is utilised while Satyasoma accuses Nāgasena in public when he first helps Devasomā to get up. There is also a suggestion that Satyasoma still couldn’t trust Devasomā completely since she has already betrayed Babhrukalpa before. Also notice that Nāgasena is being tested in the two things which are forbidden for him and he betrays his failure in both those things.

#### Arbitration
The entry of Babhrukalpa makes things more complicated since Devasomā was previously his partner and he is at once thinking of revenge. He also expresses his disapproval by calling her kṣaurikadāsī (lit. barber’s slave, fig. can be a derogatory word.) who was lured by a few shells but the comparison he gives for her, ‘like a cow led by grass’ also means he is not so angry about her, but rather thinks she might be innocent. Seeing the ongoing fight he quotes the famous verse from the Mahābhārata.

> अन्यथा वर्तमानानाम्  
> अर्थो जातोऽयमन्यथा ।  
> अस्माभिर् यद् अनुष्ठेयं  
> गन्धर्वैस् तदनुष्ठितम् ॥ ३.२३१.१५ ॥+++(5)+++
>  
> Mahābhārata Vanaparva

When Duryodhana has been captured by the gandharvas, his minister comes to Dharmarāja and begs him to rescue his master. Bhīma hearing this tells, “Whatever we were supposed to do, the gandharvas have done that instead!” Let’s not spoil it in any manner.

To be noted here is the note (Translational notes - 26, reproduced below verbatim, except for the changes in diacritics) given by Lockwood and Bhat, not only do they miss the reference to Mahābhārata they go off tangentially about Gandharvas, the details being totally irrelevant to the discussion.+++(4)+++

> “26. Gandharvas are anthropomorphic heavenly beings. They are often thought to be the cause of mischievous situations. At one level, Babhrukalpa’s remark indicates that the Gandharvas have played a trick on Satyasoma and spirited away his skull-bowl. Babhrukalpa is delighted to find Satyasöma in difficulty. He wants revenge on Satyasoma for having lured Devasomā away from him in the past. By now encouraging Nāgasena’s side in the dispute, he hopes to humiliate Satyasoma. At a second level, Babhrukalpa’s remark is a jibe at the unchaste character of Devasomā. Gandharvas were notoriously fond of mortal women.”

Even N P Unni missed this reference to Mahābhārata but says that the phrase, अस्माभिर्यदनुष्ठेयं गन्धर्वैस्तदनुष्ठितम्, would have been quite famous during the times of Mahendravarman. Ramaratnam also doesn’t mention the source of this phrase.

Babhrukalpa wants to follow Bhīma’s counsel and fan the flames more while posing as a neutral arbitrator.

While both parties claim that they are truthful, Nāgasena goes one up by quoting five out of ten of the tenets showing he remembers them offhand and so adheres to them too.

> अदत्तादानाद्विरमणं शिक्षापदम् ।  
> [Not taking what isn’t readily given, is what is ordered]
>
> मृषावादाद्विरमणं शिक्षापदम् ।  
> [Not speaking lies, is what is ordered]
>
> अब्रह्मचार्याद्विरमणं शिक्षापदम् ।  
> [following brahmacarya, is what is ordered]
>
> प्राणातिपाताद् विरमणं शिक्षापदम् ।  
> [Not killing any living being, is what is ordered]
>
> अकालभोजनाद्विरमणं शिक्षापदम् ।  
> [Not eating at inappropriate times, is what is ordered]

One should note that one of these अब्रह्मचार्याद्विरमणं is something he wants to change by finding the “true” teachings of Tathāgata.+++(4)+++

Meanwhile he is forced to show the bowl, Satyasoma claims it to be as black as a crow, thus being of a different color. Nāgasena is accused of changing the color, just like his robes which were initially white and now have become ochre.+++(4)+++ The author also hints at the fact that Buddhism taught the same ideas as enshrined in the Upanishads, only in a different colour. Devasomā meanwhile remembers the previous state of the bowl which was like the skull of Brahmā himself, colored similar to a lotus stalk, having the fragrance of the drink now being soiled due to the robes of Nāgasena.

Satyasoma alludes to two of the famous beheadings one of Brahmā by Śiva and the other of Triśiras by Indra, both lead to brahmahatyādoṣa which was overcome by prāyaścitta and so says this minor thing can be easily fixed.

Both Satyasoma and Nāgasena aren’t ignorant of their scriptures, but they have used their intelligence to twist them as per their convenience instead. Many times, people who are innocent and ignorant will follow whatever is told to them and so in general they don’t fall to such degeneracy. It is the intelligent ones who do so.

Next we see the shape of the bowl is different, again Satyasoma has a retort, of course Nāgasena is a follower of māya’s son, so it would be easy for him to change the shape. Buddhism advocates Nihilism, taking the world to be false. This was a point of dispute among the various schools of Indian philosophy. This favourite jibe against Buddhism is hinted at here.

If one thinks shifting goal posts, ad hominem attacks are a recent phenomenon fuelled by the advent of the internet one needs to think again!

While Babhrukalpa enjoys the fight he finally decides that he can’t be the arbitrator. Was it a genuine realization? Or he wanted to enjoy more drama in the court? Looks like the latter. Devasomā is immediately worried that they’ll lose since they aren’t as affluent as the buddhists who can bribe officials. The phrase used to indicate bribing , मुखानि पूरयितुं, is quite idiomatic to say the least,+++(5)+++ This stands testimony to the fact that the mata based on austerities and self-negation has become materially affluent artha portion hasn’t been tempered by dharma, the other mata which has nothing forbidden actually in terms of kāma has become destitute. This also indicates the generosity of Hindu kings who munificently donated to Buddhist monasteries. The royal families of the Śungas, Sātavāhanas and Guptas, who were adherents of Sanātana dharma, were considerate to Buddhism and other atheistic systems of philosophy.

## Unmattaka enters
Finally the resolution of the plot happens when Unmattaka enters. Having snatched the bowl from the dog he comes to Babhrukalpa whom he calls as his “preceptor”, Śūranandin. Unmattaka’s dialogues seem to have been inspired by Śūdraka’s Śakāra. Mixing up the relationships, Bhīma and Ghaṭotkaca and so on. Śakāra wasn’t actually mad but had a villainous humor, while here Unmattaka is really a mad person and so, his utterances can’t be associated with such villainy.
