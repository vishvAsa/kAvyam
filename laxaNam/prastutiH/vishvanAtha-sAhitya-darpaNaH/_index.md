Visvanatha (kaviraja):  
Sahityadarpana, with the author's autocommentary Vasudhakara,  
Bhattacarya Srimahesvara Tarkalamkara's [=Mahesvarabhatta's] Vijnapriya,  
and Anantadasa's Locana  

Input by members of the Sansknet project  
(http://sansknet.ac.in)  

NOTE:  
The Sansknet version consists of three separate files for each pariccheda:  
1) the mula text,   
2) Maheśvarabhaṭṭa's Vijnapriyā (erroneously called Vilocanā), continuously  
"numbered" according to the consonants of the Sanskrit alphabet ["(vi, ka)", "(vi kha)", etc.]  
and   
3) Anantadāsa's Locanā, continuously "numbered" according to vowels ["(lo, a)", "(lo, ā)" etc.].  
However, the respective references to the "numberings" of the commentaries are  
missing in the mula text, which renders their coordination impossible.  
  
This GRETIL version integrates the separate Sansknet files for the two commentaries   
according to the following edition:  
  
Śrīmadālaṃkārikacakravartitrikaliṅgagajapatisāmrājyasāndhi-  
vigrahakamahāpātra-Viśvanāthakavirāja-praṇītaḥ  
Sāhityadarpaṇaḥ  
granthakṛdātmabhuvā Sāhityadarpaṇavasudhākareṇa,  
Anantadāsena viracitayā Locanākhyayā,  
Bhaṭṭācārya-śrī-Maheśvara-Tarkālaṃkāra-praṇītayā Vijñapriyā-samākhyayā ca vyākhyayā samakaṃkṛtaḥ
