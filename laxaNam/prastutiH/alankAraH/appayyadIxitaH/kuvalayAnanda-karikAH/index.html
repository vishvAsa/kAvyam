<p>PREFATORY NOTE.</p>
<p>In the following, I have attempted to place within the easy reach of modern students of Sanskṛit literature, that elementary and classic, but nevertheless difficult treatise on Alankāras, the Kuvalayānanda Kārikās of Appaya Dīkshita, with an English translation, Tīkā commentary, and explanatory notes, so as to enable them to sufficiently understand and digest the subject even in the absence of better teachers.</p>
<p>Among the numerous treatises on the Science of poetry, the <strong>KĀVYAPRAKĀSA</strong>—the “Illustration of Poetry,”—the<strong>SĀHITYA DARPANA</strong>—the “Mirror of Composition,”—and the <strong>KUVALAYĀNANDA</strong>—the “Delight of the moon-lotus,”—are considered the best. Of these, the first-named is by far the most difficult and erudite work, notwithstanding innumerable commentaries thereon by able hands. The second is less difficult, and it is a complete treatise—<em>ne plus ultra</em>—on the whole subject of Sanskṛit composition, including Dramaturgy. The last-named treatise, which is the most elementary as well as the most elegant of all, confines itself only to Alankāras or ‘ornaments’of the language, the portion that forms the subject matter of the tenth chapter of the first two treatises. There already exist excellent English translations of the <em>Kāvyaprakāsa</em> and the <em>Sāhitya-Darpana</em>; yet, they, being higher treatises, are intelligible only to advanced students under the guidance of able teachers. And the Kuvalayānanda, with its elementary definitions of the principal Alankāras and its apt examples, is the work that every student of this branch of Sanskṛit Literature usually commences with. The Kuvalayānanda is a sort of commentary, in the form of notes, and an expansion of the fifth chapter of an ancient work on the Science of poetry, known as the <strong>CHANDRĀLOKA</strong> by Jayadeva Kavi, who is reputed to have</p>
<p>Hourished about the 12th century of the Christian era and whois more generally known to the public in connection with his charming lyric, the Gīta-Govinda. The author of the Kuvalayānanda is Appaya Dīkshita,* as appears from the penultimate verse of the work :—</p>
<p>अमुं कुवलयानन्दमकरोदप्पदीक्षितः।<br>
नियोगाद् वेङ्कटपतेर्निरुपाधिकृपानिधेः॥</p>
<p>‘AppaDīkshita wrote this Kuvalayānanda under the orders of his (Royal Patron) Venkaṭapati, a store-house of guileless mercy.’</p>
<p>From which it would also appear that he flourished at the court of the king Venkaṭapati and that it was at his suggestion that the treatise was written. This Appaya Dīkshita is admitted on all hands to have been a native of Aḍayappa Agrahāra, near Kānchīpura (the modern Canjeeveram), and to have lived in the 16th century of the Christian era. He not only took the 5th chapter of the Chandrāloka for his basis, but has mostly re-written many of the definitions and examples of that treatise, as he himself says at the very outset:—</p>
<p>येषां चन्द्रालोके दृश्यन्ते लक्ष्यलक्षणश्लोकाः।<br>
प्रायस्त एव तेषामितरेषामभिनवा विरच्यन्ते॥</p>
<p>‘Such verses as are found in the Chandrāloka defining and exemplifying the Alankāras are for the most part adopted here also (with slight modifications); but, for some others, new verses have been composed.’</p>
<p>To these verses so modified or newly composed, our author has also added short elucidatory notes in prose, and to these notes he gave the name of Kuvalayānanda, probably in acknowledgment of his original basis, the Chandrāloka. Thus, he concludes his work with the following very expressive verse:—</p>
<p>__________________________________________________________</p>
<p>* Called also अप्पदीक्षितः, अप्पादीक्षित, अप्यय्यदीक्षितand अप्यय्यादीक्षित।</p>
<p>चन्द्रालोको विजयतां शरदागमसम्भवः।<br>
हृद्यः कुवलयानन्दो यत्प्रसादादभूदयम्॥</p>
<p>‘May this <em>Chandraloka</em>, the cause of its commentary entitled<em>Saradagama,</em> from the contact of both of which this charming Kuvalayānanda originated, be supreme (in this world).’</p>
<p>The other meaning of the verse is :—</p>
<p>‘May the sight of the autumnal moon from the contact of which the delight of the moon-lotus sprang be supreme.’</p>
<p>The verses, alone as modified and finally adopted by Appaya Dīkshita in his treatise, often go by the name of Kuvalayānanda-Kārikās or the memorial verses of Kuvalayānanda,’and these have been separately compiled and edited under the title of <strong>KUVALAYĀNANDA KĀRIKĀH</strong> by the poet Āśādhara, with a lucid commentary of his own. The verses themselves are, as already mentioned, simple and in elegant style, in the Anushṭubh metre, the first half of each verse defining the Alankāra and the second half exemplifying the same.</p>
<p>Before proceeding to explain the arrangement that I have followed in this work, it may not be out of place to say a word or two as to the necessity of this production and as. to the aim and object which I have had in placing the same before the public. For the acquisition of a sound knowledge of any language, a knowledge of the rules of its Grammar, including Rhetoric and Composition, will be admitted to be essential. This is especially the case when the language in question happens to be not a spoken vernacular,. but an unspoken classical language like the Sanskṛit. All the works in the Sanskṛit Literature are found to have been composed upon fixed principles of Grammar and Rhetoric; and formerly, at any rate, no work that was not in complete accordance with the immutable rules of Sāhitya was ever allowed to be published. And in those days, the authors also, whatever their social position or poetical fame may be, never ventured out</p>
<p>with any composition that did not gain the approval of the learned. One remarkable instance of this which occurred in connection with the publication of the <em>Champū</em> <em>Rāmāyana</em> by king Bhoja might here be given in illustration of the above:—</p>
<p>Bhoja Vikramāditya wrote his Champū– a poem composed in prose and verse— during the absence of his favourite poet Kālidāsa whom the king in one of his angry moods had banished from his court. That great learned king did not dare to publish his poem without first obtaining the approval of the greatest poet of India! Then the whereabouts of Kālidāsa was not known. He therefore proposed to the publie the following <em>Samasyā</em>—a part of the stanza or an incomplete stanza— to be completed:—</p>
<p>कुसुमे कुसुमोत्पत्तिः श्रूयते न च दृश्यते।</p>
<p>‘The production of another flower upon a flower has been heard but not actually seen (anywhere).’</p>
<p>The king expected the appropriate fulfilment of this most difficult <em>Samasyā</em>from Kālidāsa alone. He declared publicly that he would bestow upon whoever completed the Samasya half of his kingdom. Kālidāsa&rsquo;s lady wrote this Samasya upon one of the walls of her bed-chamber where Kālidāsa was living secretly. When he saw the stanza on the wall, he wrote under it addressing the lady whom he thought to be the writer of the same, thus:—</p>
<p>बाले तव मुखाम्भोजे नयनेन्दीवरद्वम्।</p>
<p>‘Young dame! There is a couple of eye-lotuses in thy face-lotus.’</p>
<p>The lady then threw Kālidāsa into a pit specially prepared and let fall a big stone upon him; but she, in her hurry to go to the king to get half of his kingdom, did not stop there to see whether Kālidāsa was completely killed or not. The lady went to the king; and the ready-witted king, seeing the</p>
<p>fulfilment of the stanza addressed to a female and not to a male as it ought to be, if filled up by her, and, thinking that Kālidāsa was living in her house, asked her whether she had spared the life of Kālidāsa. She replied that she had thrown him into a pit and did not know if he had completely expired. The king hurried to the scene of action with his poem in hand. Kālidāsa, only half dead then, said to his weeping king that the human life is unstable, that tolearned people this world is nothing but its proper nothingness, and that he should therefore be allowed to pass the remaining few minutes of his life to meditate upon the Supreme Spirit. The king wanted his poem on divine Rāma to be read over to him so that he may correct all the blemishes contained in it. The king read his poem and a running criticism was made by the Greatest Poet of India, and, when the last stanza of the Sundarakāṇḍa was read, Kālidāsa expired. The king offered to the public his Champū, one of the best poems of the language, up to Sundarakāṇḍa only, the remaining two kāṇḍas, <em>Yuddha-kanda</em> and <em>Uttara-kanda</em>, having been torn away by the king on the spot as they were not perused by Kālidāsa.</p>
<p>Such was the criticism going on in India before the publication of any work. It was the look-out of every critic to see whether the particular work has been composed in strict accordance with the fixed rules of Grammar, Rhetoric etc. Hence, it is necessary that a student should know something of the Grammar, Figures of Speech of the language etc., to enable him to understand a poem. In other words, a student can very easily master a poem if he has known something of the Grammar and Alankāras. For the acquirement of the elements of the Sanskṛit Grammar in its connection with the Language, the First and Second Books of Sanskṛit were placed before the public over 35 years ago by that great oriental scholar, Mr. Rāmakṛishṇa Gopāla Bhanḍarakara; and they still remain as modelText Books of the kind. Let me quote here his own words from the prefaces to his Second Book:—</p>
<p>‘My object has been to render thisas much a Sanskṛit Reading Book as a book on Sanskṛit Grammar; in other words, not only to teach Grammatical forms to the student, but to enable him to construe Sanskṛit.’</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>‘I was not so sanguine about the success of this book as of the first. But I am very happy to perceive that this also has met with favour, and that along with the first it has become the means, howsoever humble, of facilitating and promoting the study of the language of the ancient Rishis among their modern descendants.’</p>
<p>As for the acquirement of the knowledge of the Alankāras, almost in every institution, the Kuvalayānanda appears to have been recommended as a text book for the B.A. degree students. But in the majority, the students either do not read the book, or they do not care to grasp and digest what their Professors might teach them about these Alankāras. The study of Alankāras is as essential as that of Grammar. No poem contains a verse that is not embellished by one Alankāra or another.For, Alankrās, by adding to the beauty of word and sense; serve to heighten the flavour (RASA) etc.,just as ornaments adorn and beautify the human form. That great learned Dr. R. G. Bhanḍarakara in the preface to the first edition of his First Book of Sanskṛit says truly enough:—</p>
<p>I have heard students complain that they find Sanskṛit moredifficult than Latin. *** I do not know if this complaint has foundation in the structure of the two languages; but this, at least, I am sure of, that Sanskṛit would be considerably more easy than it is, if there were men educated&rsquo; in our English Colleges to teach it, and <em>if books specially adapted for beginners were available.*</em></p>
<p>That the above remarks of the great Bombay Educationist were true, has been amply proved by the very prominent position which his First and Second Books of Sanskṛit have been given in the Indian Educational curriculam. So far as I am</p>

<p>*The italics areours.</p>
<p>aware, no such book has till now been placed within the reach of the Sanskṛit students on the subject of Alankāras. And I have therefore ventured to offer this to the public in the sincere hope that it may supply to some extent the long-felt want of the students of this branch of Sanskṛit Literature.</p>
<p>The Alankāras in Sanskṛit are generally classed under three heads, viz. :—</p>
<p><strong>i.</strong> <strong>शब्दालंकार</strong>— Ornament of word;</p>
<p><strong>ii.</strong> <strong>अर्थालंकार</strong>— Ornament of sense;and</p>
<p><strong>iii.</strong> <strong>शब्दार्थालंकार</strong>— Ornament of both word and sense.</p>
<p>Of these, the 2nd class, viz., Ornaments of Sense alone are now treated in the present work. The other two, not being of so much importance, except to very advanced scholars, are not dwelt upon here.</p>
<p>In the present volume, each and every word in the verse containing the definition and the example is given in its prose order (<em>anvaya</em>) in an intelligible way with its English equivalent and a literal English translation of the verse has been given under the same together with all the necessary explanations that are sufficient to help the student in understanding the Figure and its example himself without the assistance of a teacher. In the Appendix, almost all the conventions of poets are given; <strong>UPAMĀ</strong>in its 32 varieties and the <strong>APRASTUTAPRASAMSĀ</strong>in its 5 varieties are treated with their appropriate examples taken from the standard works. Additional examples of certain Figures that require such are also given. The three Figures—<strong>ANUMĀNA</strong>—‘Inference,’<strong>SAMSRISHTI</strong>—‘Conjunction,’and <strong>SANKARA</strong>—‘Commixture,’—which are not found in the body of the book are also defined and exemplified. To it are also appended a more or less scientific classification of the Alankāras treated in the book, and an explanatory note, showing the mutual distinguishing peculiarities of many of the Alankāras.</p>
<p>Now I must mention here. the works I have consulted in the course of the publication of the present volume. The first and foremost of these is the Sāhitya-Darpana of Vishvanātha Kavirāja with its English translation by that distinguished scholar, Rai Bahadur Pramada Dasa Mitra of Benares. Many of the English renderings of the Figures of Speech are adopted from the work of that able orientalist who borrowed the same from Mr. R. T. H. Griffith&rsquo;s paper on Indian Figures of Speech appended to his Specimens of Old Indian Poetry. The Chandrikā and the Rasikaranjinī,the two famous commentaries on Kuvalayānanda, were also my chief guides. The Kāvyaprakasa and its English translation, the Pratāpa-Rudrīya of Vidyānātha Bhaṭṭa and the Sāhitya-Ratnākara of Śrī Dharma Sūri were also consulted. My heart-felt thanks are also due to Messrs. J. N. Banerjee and Son of Calcutta for their neat execution of the work and for their extreme kindness shown to me in the course of its publication.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I only hope that the work now offered to the public may serve the purpose for which it is intended— namely, to enable the student to thoroughly understand this difficult branch of Sanskṛit Literature without much difficulty and with very little of extraneous help. I am fully aware that, in a work of this kind, there must be several defects and errors, and I most humbly crave the favour of the public, who will have occasion to do me the honour of perusing this little book, to be so good as to point out to me the portions which require amendments or corrections; and I shall be only very willing to give my best consideration to those suggestions in any future edition of the work.</p>

<p>AUTHOR&rsquo;S PREFACE TO THE WORK.</p>
<p>अलंकारेषु बालानामवगाहनसिद्धये।<br>
ललितः क्रियते तेषां लक्ष्यलक्षणसंग्रहः॥</p>
<p>‘This elegant treatise on Alankāras with their concise definitions and apt examples has been composed (by me) for the purpose of enabling the young students to understand the ornaments easily.’</p>
<p>______</p>
<p>Ex. O Kṛishna, thy fame like a she-swan enters the celestial Ganges (or pervades the celestial regions and this earth).</p>
<p>This is an example of <strong>पूर्णोपमा</strong> (<strong>पूर्णा</strong>= full, <strong>उपमा</strong>= simile) ‘simile complete’; for, it contains all the four essentials of comparison, which are:—</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>उपमेयम्, वर्ण्यम्</strong> or <strong>विषयः</strong>—The object compared, i.e., the subject of comparison, such as face &amp;c.</p>
<p><strong>2. उपमानम्, अवर्ण्यम्</strong> or <strong>विषयी</strong>—The object compared to, i.e., the standard of comparison, such as moon, lotus &amp;c.</p>
<p><strong>3. साधारणधर्मः</strong> or <strong>सामान्यधर्मः</strong> or simply <strong>धर्मः</strong>—The common attribute, i.e., the characteristic resemblance between the two objects (the object compared and the object compared to); or the quality of the said two objects that occasions their similitude such as charmingness or the like.</p>
<p>** 4. उपमावाचकः** or simply <strong>वाचकः</strong>—The word implying comparison, suchas<strong>इव</strong> &lsquo;as&rsquo; or the like.</p>
<p>In the present example:—</p>
<p><strong>कीर्त्तिः</strong>—the object compared</p>
<p>** हंसी**—the object compared to</p>
<p><strong>अवगाहते</strong>, i.e, <strong>अवगाहनक्रिया</strong>= ‘the act of entering or pervading’— the common attribute</p>
<p>** इव**= the word implying comparison.</p>
<p>Observe:— <strong>कीर्त्तिः</strong>‘fame,&rsquo; <strong>यशस्</strong> ‘reputation&rsquo; and <strong>हासः</strong>‘laughter’are always described as white according to the convention of the poets. Hence, the fame of Kṛishna is compared to a swan which is of white colour.</p>
<p>8 KINDS OF SIMILE ELLIPTICAL.</p>
<p>वण्योपमानधर्माणामुपमावाचकस्य च।<br>
एकद्वित्र्यनुपादानाद्भिन्ना लुप्तोपमाष्टधा॥</p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>By the omission of one, two or three (of the four requisites of simile complete, i.e., the object compared, the object compared to, the common attribute and the word implying comparison) the simile becomes elliptical and is eightfold, which are:—</p>
<p><strong>1. वाचकलुप्ता</strong>— SIMILE in the omission of the word implying comparison.</p>
<p><strong>2. धर्मलुप्ता</strong>—Do. Do. of the common attribute.</p>
<p><strong>3. धर्मवाचकलुप्ता</strong>—Do.Do. of the common attribute and of the word implying comparison.</p>
<p><strong>4. वाचकोपमेयलुप्ता</strong>—Do. Do. of the word implying comparison and of the object compared.</p>
<p><strong>5. उपमानवाचकलुप्ता</strong>— Do. Do. compared to and the word parison.</p>
<p><strong>6. उपमानलुप्ता</strong>—Do. Do. of the object compared to.</p>
<p><strong>7. उपमानवाचकधर्मलुप्ता</strong>—Do. Do. of the object compared to, of the word implying comparison and of the common attribute.</p>
<p><strong>8. उपमानधर्मलुप्ता</strong>—Do. Do. of the object compared to and of the common attribute.</p>
<p><em>Examples of the first four Elliptical Similes in their order.</em></p>
<p>तड़िद्गौरीन्दुतुल्यास्या कर्पूरन्तीदृशोर्मम।<br>
कान्त्या स्मरवधूयन्ती दृष्टा तन्वी रहो मया॥</p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>A slender woman was seen by me in a lonely place— a woman (as) yellowish as the lightning; and, having the face like the moon, she acts (like) camphor to my eyes, and by (her) loveliness she acts (herself) like the Goddess of love.</p>
<p><strong>1. तड़िद्गौरी</strong>— If this compound is uncompounded, we have <strong>तड़िद् इव गौरी</strong>, where:—</p>
<p>** तड़िद्**—the object compared to</p>
<p><strong>गौरी</strong>— the common attribute</p>
<p>** तन्वी**— the object compared.</p>
<p>We have, in this example, these 3 requisites, but the remaining requisite, the word <strong>इव</strong>, expressive of comparison, is indirectly omitted; and, in the expansion of the compound, it becomes expressed and so this is the example of the Elliptical Simile, No. 1,— in the omission of the word implying comparison (<strong>वाचकलुप्ता</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>2. इन्दुतुल्यास्या</strong>, when uncompounded, becomes <strong>इन्दुनातुल्यं आस्यं यस्याः सा</strong> ‘she whose face is like the moon,’where:—</p>
<p>** इन्दुः**— the object compared to</p>
<p><strong>तुल्यम्</strong>— the word implying comparison</p>
<p><strong>आस्यम्</strong>— the object compared.</p>
<p>Here, we have the above three requisites; and the remaining requisite— the common attribute such as charmingness &amp;c., we have not got. Hence, this is the example of the Elliptical Simile, No. 2,— in the omission of the common attribute (<strong>धर्मलुप्ता</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Observe</em>:— With regard to Elliptical Similes in the omission of the common attribute only, the word omission **‘लोपः’**is used strictly in the sense in which it is used in the Pānini&rsquo;s Sūtra <strong>‘अदर्शनं लोपः’</strong>(I. 1. 60) ‘The disappearance is called **‘लोपः’**With regard to the omissions of the other three, i.e., the object compared, the object compared to and the word implying comparison, they are indirectly omitted; but when the compounds which contain them are uncompounded, they come to light, and thus, we see, they are understood. Moreover, the student should note that, without these three requisites, either expressed or understood, there will be no simile at all.</p>
<p><strong>3. कर्परन्ती दृशोर्मम। कर्पूरन्ती</strong>is the present participial noun, feminine gender, of the nominal verb ‘**कर्पूरति’**having the <strong>क्विप्</strong> affix expressive of comparison omitted. If it is uncompounded, it becomes <strong>कर्पूरमिव आचरन्ती</strong>— &lsquo;she acts like the camphor&rsquo;, where:—</p>
<p>** (1) तन्वी**—in the second line of the sloka is the object compared and</p>
<p>** (2)कर्पूरम्**—is the object compared to.</p>
<p>Thus, we have here only the above two requisites and the other two ingredients of comparison, the common attribute and the word implying comparison, are omitted. Hence, this is the example of the Elliptical Simile, No. 3,— in the omission of the common attribute and the word implying comparison (<strong>धर्मवाचकलुप्ता</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>4. कांत्यास्मरवधूयन्ती</strong>— by (her) loveliness, she acts (herself) like Kāma&rsquo;s bride. The compound<strong>स्मरवधूयन्ती</strong>is the present participial noun, feminine gender, of the nominal verb<strong>स्मरवधूयति</strong>having the affix ‘kyach&rsquo; (<strong>क्यच्</strong>) expressive of comparison. If it is uncompounded, it becomes <strong>आत्मानम्स्मरवधूम् इव आचरन्ती</strong>; where we have</p>
<p>** (1) स्मरवधू**—the object compared to</p>
<p>** (2) कांत्या**—the common attribute</p>
<p>only two essentials of comparison. The other two, i.e., the object compared<strong>आत्मानम्‘<strong>herself&rsquo; and the word expressive of comparison</strong>इव</strong>  &lsquo;as&rsquo; are indirectly omitted. Hence, we have the example of the Elliptical Simile, No. 4,—inthe omission of the</p>
<p>word implying comparison and the object compared (<strong>वाचकोपमेयलुप्ता</strong>).</p>

<p>यत्तया मेलनं तत्र लाभो मे यश्च तद्रतेः।<br>
तदेतत्काकतालीयमवितर्कितसम्भवम्॥</p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>My meeting with that lady, in that lonely place, and my gain of sexual intercourse with that lady— each is an accidental occurrence like the maxim of the crow and the palm fruit.</p>
<p>This is the most puzzling example. The compound<strong>काकतालीयम्</strong>must be first analyzed; but its analysis can be best understood only when the Pānini&rsquo;s Sūtra <strong>समासाच्च तद्विषयात्</strong>(V. 3. 106) with its commentary is rightly and fully understood. This Sūtra contains 3 words and one word <strong>छः</strong>is to be supplied from the preceding Sūtra (V. 3. 105) and the full Sūtra stands thus:—</p>
<p>समासात् च तद्-विषयात् छः।</p>
<p>The affix Chha (<strong>ईय</strong>) comes, also in the sense of</p>
<p>&rsquo;like this&rsquo;, after a compound noun containing in itself the force of ‘like this&rsquo; (hidden).</p>
<p>Kāsikā commentary on the Sūtra.</p>
<p>**तद् इत्यनेन प्रकृतः इवार्थः निर्दिश्यते—**By the word <strong>तद्</strong> the sense of <strong>इव</strong>, the subject of discussion, is referred to.</p>
<p><strong>इवार्थविषयात् समासात् अपरस्मिन् इवार्थे एव छः प्रत्ययो भवति—</strong></p>
<p>The affix Chha (<strong>ईय</strong>) comes, only in the second sense of <strong>इव</strong> like this&rsquo;, after a compound containing in itself the force of <strong>इव</strong>.</p>
<p>Examples.</p>
<p><strong>1. काकतालीयम्</strong>—Like the maxim of the crow (<strong>काक</strong>) and the palm fruit (<strong>ताल</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>2. अजाकृपाणीयम्</strong>—Like the death of a goat (<strong>अजा</strong>) by the accidental falling of a sword (<strong>कृपाण</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>3. अन्धकवर्त्तिकीयम्</strong>—Like the accidental falling of a quail (<strong>वर्त्तिकी</strong>) into the hands of a blind person (<strong>अन्धक</strong>).</p>
<p>_______</p>
<p><strong>अतर्कितोपनतं चित्रीकरणम् उच्यते</strong>—Unintentional and strange coincidences are referred to here.</p>
<p><strong>तत् कथम्</strong>—</p>
<p>How is that.</p>
<p><strong>काकस्य आगमनम् यादृच्छिकम्</strong>— The coming of the crow is accidental.</p>
<p>**तालस्य पतनं च—**As also the (sudden) fall of the palm fruit (on the head of the crow).</p>
<p><strong>तेन तालेन पतता काकस्य वधः कृतः</strong>—By the palm fruit thus falling, the death of the crow occurred.</p>
<p><strong>एवं एवदेवदत्तस्य तत्र आगमनम्</strong>— In the very same manner, the coming of Devadatta (a person) there.</p>
<p><strong>दस्यूनां च उपनिपातः</strong>— In the same manner, the sudden attack of robbers (upon Devadatta).</p>
<p><strong>तैश्च तस्य वधः कृतः</strong>— By them (robbers) his (Devadatta&rsquo;s) death occurred.</p>
<p><strong>तत्र यो देवदत्तस्य दस्यूनां च समागमः, सः काकतालसमागमसदृशः</strong>—There, the coincidence of the person Devadatta and the robbers is like that of the crow and the palm fruit.</p>
<p><strong>इति एकः उपमार्थः</strong>—This is the <em>first</em> sense of &rsquo;like this&rsquo; (in the compound <strong>काकतालम्</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>अतश्च देवदत्तस्य वधः, सः काकतालवधसदृशः</strong>—</p>
<p>Then, the killing of Devadatta is like that of the crow by the fall of the palm fruit.</p>
<p><strong>इति द्वितीयः उपमार्थः</strong>—This is the <em>second</em> sense of ‘like this’.</p>
<p><strong>तत्र प्रथमे, समासः</strong>— In the first case, we have the senseof <strong>इव</strong> in the compound (<strong>काकतालम्</strong> hidden).</p>
<p><strong>द्वितीये, प्रत्ययः</strong>—In the second case, we have the same, expressed in the affix <strong>छ</strong> (in the compound <strong>काकतालीयम्</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>समासश्च अयम् अस्मादेव ज्ञापकात्</strong>—The implication of such a compound, having the sense of &rsquo;like this&rsquo; hidden, is indicated by this Sūtra only.</p>
<p><strong>नहि अस्य अपरं लक्षणंअस्ति</strong>—</p>
<p>There is no other rule for the formation of this compound but this indica-</p>
<p>tion (as no such compound with the force of <strong>इव</strong> is taught in the chapter on compounds).</p>
<p>By a careful study of this Sūtra with its commentary, we come to know that the compound <strong>काकतालीयम्</strong>contains two senses of &lsquo;<strong>इव</strong>= like this&rsquo; ; the first sense is hidden in the compound<strong>काकतालम्</strong>and the second sense is expressed by means of the affix chha in the compound <strong>काकतालीयम्</strong>.</p>
<p>The compound <strong>काकतालम्</strong>if uncompounded, becomes <strong>काकः इव, तालमिव</strong> which again become <strong>काकागमनमिव</strong> &rsquo;like the coming of the crow&rsquo; and<strong>तालफलपतनमिव</strong>‘like the falling of the palm fruit&rsquo;.</p>
<p>From the sloka quoted above, let us first take the example for the Elliptical Simile, No. 5,— in the omission of the object compared to and the word implying comparison and consider the same.</p>
<p><strong>यत्तया मेलनम् तत् अवितर्कितसंभवं काकतालम्</strong> where <strong>मेलनम्</strong> is the object compared and <strong>अवितर्कितसंभवम्</strong> is the common attribute. Here, we have only the above two essentials of comparison. The other two— the object compared to and the word implying comparison, are both hidden in the compound <strong>काकतालम्</strong>. The coming of the person (<strong>पुरुषागमनम्</strong>) is compared to the coming of the crow (<strong>काकागमनम्</strong>) and the coming of the lady is compared to the falling of the palm fruit (<strong>तालफलपतनम्</strong>). The union of these two, i.e., the person and the lady (<strong>तयोःमेलनम्</strong>) which is the object compared) is like that of the crow and the palm fruit (<strong>काकतालसमागमसदृशम्</strong>). The word <strong>समागमः</strong>, the object compared to, and the word, <strong>इव</strong>, implying comparison,</p>
<p>are both omitted. Hence, we have the Elliptical Simile, No. 5,— in the omission of the object compared to and the word implying comparison.</p>
<p>Let us then consider the example for the Elliptical Simile No. 6.</p>
<p>लाभो मे यश्च तद्रतेः<br>
तदेतत् काकतालीयम् अवितर्कितसंभवम्॥</p>
<p>Where:—</p>
<p><strong>लाभः</strong> is the object compared,<strong>अवितर्कितसंभवम्</strong> is the common attribute and the compound <strong>काकतालीयम्</strong>contains the object compared to, ‘<strong>उपभोगः</strong>eating,’ hidden and the word implying comparison expressed by the affix <strong>छ</strong>(<strong>ईय</strong>) because the compound, if uncompounded, becomes <strong>काकतालम् इव=</strong>*<strong>काककृततालोपभोगसदृशः</strong>‘like the eating of the palm fruit by the crow’: In this example, we have the above three ingredients of comparison; and the fourth, the object compared to, is omitted. Hence, this is the example of the Elliptical Simile, No. 6,— in the omission of the object compared to.</p>
<p>Now, if we take away the common attribute <strong>अवितर्कितसंभवम्</strong> from the sloka which contains the examples for the Elliptical Similes Nos. 5 and 6 and substitute in its place <strong>‛अभवत् किं ब्रवीमि ते’</strong>= ‘It so</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>* In the Kāsikā commentary on V. 3. 106, this compound stands in its expansion thus— <strong>काकतालवधसदृशः</strong>‘like the death of the crow by the sudden fall of the palm fruit&rsquo;. The student should note here that this and the other two similar compounds are used to denote the accidental occurrence whether <em>welcome or unwelcome</em> as the case may be.</p>
<p>chanced; what shall I tell you&rsquo;; and read the sloka thus:—</p>
<p>यत्तया मेलनं तत्र लाभो मे यश्च तद्रतेः।<br>
तदेतत्काकतालीयमभवत् किं ब्रवीमि ते॥</p>
<p>We have here the omission of the common attribute in the above two examples.</p>
<p>In the first example:—</p>
<p><strong>मेलनम्</strong>is the object compared and, of the other three essentials of comparison, the common attribute is directly omitted, and the object compared to and the word implying comparison are indirectly omitted in the compound<strong>काकतालम्</strong> as explained before and so we have the example of the Elliptical Simile, No. 7,— in the omission of the object compared to the word implying comparison and the common attribute (<strong>उपमानवाचकधर्मलुप्ता</strong>).</p>
<p>In the second example:—</p>
<p><strong>लाभः</strong>is the object compared and the compound <strong>काकतालीयम्</strong> contains the object compared to hidden and the word implying comparison expressed in the affix <strong>छ</strong>and we have no common attribute; so we have the example of the Elliptical Simile, No. 8,— in the omission of the object compared to and of the common attribute (<strong>उपमानधर्मलुप्ता</strong>).</p>
<p>Thus, in one sloka, we have the examples of the second four Elliptical Similes Nos. 5 to 8. This ornament <strong>उपमा</strong>is distinguishable from certain other</p>
<p>ornaments such as <strong>अनन्वयः</strong>No. II.— &lsquo;Comparison Absolute,&rsquo; <strong>रूपकम्</strong> No. V.— Metaphor, <strong>उपयोगपमा</strong>No. III.— Reciprocal Comparison, and <strong>व्यतिरेकः</strong>No. XX.— Dissimilitude.</p>
<p>In the Rūpaka, the resemblance is suggested whereas it is expressed here. In the Comparison Absolute, only one object is compared to itself. Here, two different objects are compared.</p>
<p>In the Reciprocal Comparison, two sentences are employed; here, only one sentence.</p>
<p>In the Dissimilitude, contrast also is stated, whereas it is not so in this figure.</p>
<p>For other peculiarities of this figure and its varieties according to Sāhityadarpana and Kāvyaprakāsa and for words expressing comparison &amp;c., see the Appendix.</p>
<p><strong>II. अनन्वयः—</strong> &lsquo;COMPARISON ABSOLUTE.&rsquo;</p>
<p>DEFINITION.</p>
<p>उपमानोपमेयत्वं यदेकस्यैव वस्तुनः।</p>
<p>EXAMPLE.</p>
<p>इन्दुरिन्दुरिव श्रीमान् इत्यादौ तदनन्वयः॥</p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>When the object compared to and the object compared are one and the same, or in other words, when one and the same object is compared to itself, it is</p>
<p>Comparison Absolute— as in the illustration like<strong>इन्दुरिन्दुरिव श्रीमान्</strong> &rsquo;the glorious moon is like the moon itself &amp;c.</p>
<p><strong>अनन्वयः = नास्ति अन्वयः</strong> &lsquo;connection&rsquo; **यस्य सः=**want of connection with any other object in the world in respect of comparison.</p>
<p>The word<strong>इत्यादौ</strong> &rsquo;et cetera&rsquo; comprises such other examples as:—</p>
<p><strong>गगनं गगनाकारं सागरः सागरोपमः।<br>
रामरावणयोर्युद्धं रामरावणयोरिव॥</strong></p>
<p>(As regards spaciousness), the sky is like the sky itself. (As regards vastness), the ocean is similar to the ocean itself. (As regards awfulness), the battle between Rāma and Rāvana is like the battle between Rāma and Rāvana.</p>
<p>Here and in the example given in the text, the self-comparison of the moon, ocean, sky and the battle is to show the non-existence of their like.</p>
<p>In this figure, a sameness of terms would be more expedient for the ready understanding of the identity of the object at the very hearing. <strong>&lsquo;इन्दुः इन्दुरिव&rsquo;</strong> holds better than <strong>&lsquo;इन्दुः चन्द्रः इव&rsquo;</strong> although the latter is a synonym of the former.</p>
<p><strong>III. उपमेयोपमा</strong>— &lsquo;RECIPROCAL COMPARISON.&rsquo;</p>
<p>DEFINITION.</p>
<p>पर्यायेण द्वयोस्तच्चेदुपमेयोपमा मता।</p>
<p>EXAMPLE.</p>
<p>धर्मोऽर्थ इव पूर्णश्रीरर्थो धर्म इव त्वयि॥</p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. That, i.e., the position of Upamāna and Upameya, when alternated is declared the Reciprocal Comparison.</p>
<p>Ex. In you, O King! thy virtue is as full as (thy) riches; and thy riches as full as thy vertue.</p>
<p>Here, the object of comparing the king&rsquo;s virtue with his riches and again his riches with his virtue excluding the other similar objects is to show that there is nothing else equal to the virtue &amp;c., of the king.</p>
<p>Observe:— This figure is possible only in two sentences as the interchange of comparisons is impossible in one sentence. The Upamāna in the first sentence becomes Upameya in the second and the Upameya in the first becomes Upamāna in the second in the total absence of a third thing to be compared to. But the figure <strong>अनन्वयः</strong>No. II. is possible in one sentence, the object compared to and that compared being the same in the total absence of a second thing to be compared to.</p>
<p>IV. **प्रतीपम्—‘**CONVERSE.’</p>
<p>DEFINITION. <strong>प्रतीपमुपमानस्योपमेयत्वप्रकल्पनम्।</strong></p>
<p>EXAMPLE.<strong>त्वल्लोचनसमं पद्मं त्वद्वक्तसदृशो विधुः॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. The assumption of the object compared to as the object compared, i.e., when Upamāna (moon &amp;c.) is compared to Upameya (face &amp;c.), or in other words, when the usual form of comparison is inverted, it is the Converse.</p>
<p>Ex. (Lady!) The lotus is like thy eyes; and the moon is like thy face.</p>
<p>2nd kind of Converse.</p>
<p>DEFINITION.<strong>अन्योपमेयलाभेन वर्ण्यस्यानादरश्च तत्।</strong></p>
<p>EXAMPLE. <strong>अलं गर्वेण ते वक्त्र कांत्या चन्द्रो भवादृशः॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. When the subject on hand (face &amp;c.) is disregarded by reason of the gain of another object (i.e., moon &amp;c.) which is not the subject under discourse it is also termed Converse.</p>
<p>Ex. O face! enough of thy pride; (there is) the moon equal to thee in splendour.</p>
<p>3rd kind of Converse.</p>
<p>DEF.<strong>वर्ण्योपमेयलाभेन तथान्यस्याप्यनादरः।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>कः क्रौर्यदर्पस्ते मृत्यो त्वत्तुल्याः सन्ति हि स्त्रियः॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. When the object which is not the subject on hand is disregarded by reason of gain of another object which is the subject on hand, it is declared the third kind of Converse.</p>
<p>Ex. O death! wherefore dost thou bear the pride on account of cruelty; because, there are (many) women equal to thee (in cruelty).</p>
<p>4th kind of Converse.</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>वर्ण्येनान्यस्योपमाया अनिष्पत्तिवचश्च तत्</strong>।</p>
<p>Ex. <strong>मिथ्यावादोहि मुग्धाक्षि! त्वन्मुखाभं किलांबुजम्॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. The assertion of non-accomplishment of the resemblance of the object not on hand with the object on hand is also termed the Converse.</p>
<p>Ex. O beautiful-eyed lady! The assertion that the lotus has the likeness of thy face is an untrue one.</p>
<p>Hence, we see here that the resemblance between the two objects lotus and face being stated as untrue becomes an unaccomplished one and so it is the Converse.</p>
<p>5th kind of Converse.</p>
<p>DER. <strong>प्रतीपमुपमानस्य कैमर्थ्यमपि मन्यते।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>दृष्टं चेद्वदनं तन्व्याःकिं पद्मेन किमिन्दुना॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. The assertion ‘what is the use of the <em>upamāna</em>’(with reference to the upameya which is the subject on hand) is also considered as one of the Pratīpas.</p>
<p>Ex. When the face of that slender lady was seen, what is the use of the lotus or of the moon.</p>
<p>V. रूपकम्</p>
<p>— Metaphor.</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>विषय्यभेदताद्रूप्यरञ्जनं विषयस्य यत्।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>रूपकं तत्त्रिधाधिक्यन्यूनत्वानुभयोक्तिभिः॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. The gratifying representation of the object compared (1) as non-different from, and (2) as identical with, the object compared to is termed Rūpaka. And each (of the said two kinds) is again three-fold in point of (1) superiority, (2) inferiority and (3) the absence of both.</p>
<p>The Metaphor is first held two-fold:—(1)<strong>अभेदरूपकम्</strong> and (2) <strong>ताद्रूप्यरूपकम्</strong>. Each of these is again three-fold in point of superiority &amp;c., of the object compared over the object compared to.</p>
<p>Hence the Metaphor is six-fold which are:—</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>अधिकाभेदरूपकम्। 4. अधिकताद्रूप्यरूपकम्।</strong></p>
<p>2. न्यूनाभेदरूपकम्।   5. न्यूनताद्रूप्यरूपकम्।</p>
<p>3. अनुभयाभेदरूपकम्। 6. अनुभयताद्रूप्यरूपकम्।</p>
<p><em>Examples of these in their reverse order.</em></p>
<p>No. 3.</p>
<p>अनुभयाभेदरूपकम्।</p>
<p>Ex. <strong>अयं हि धूर्जटिः साक्षाद् येन दग्धाः पुरः क्षणात्।</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Ex. This (king) is indeed the very God Siva in bodily form; because by him the cities (of his foes) were burnt.</p>
<p>Here, the king, the upameya, who is said to have burnt the cities of his foes is represented as non-different from the God Siva, the upamāna, the destroyer of the three cities of gold, silver and iron of the demon <em>tripura,</em> and in the absence of any superiority or of inferiority between these two objects, we have the example of Rūpaka No. 3.</p>
<p>No. 2. <strong>न्यूनाभेदरूपकम्।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>अयमास्ते विना शंभुस्तार्त्तीयीकं विलोचनम्।</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Ex. Here stands (before us) this (king), the God Sambhu himself without his third eye.</p>
<p>Here, the king, the upameya, having only two eyes is represented as non-different from the God Sambhu, the upamāna, in the absence of his third eye, i.e., with an inferiority in respect of eyes. Hence, this is the example of Rūpaka No. 2.</p>
<p>No. 1.</p>
<p>अधिकाभेदरूपकम्।</p>
<p>Ex. <strong>शंभुर्विश्वमवत्येष स्वीकृत्य समदृष्टिताम्।</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Ex. This (king), the God Sambhu himself, protects the world assuming impartiality (lit. even eyes).</p>
<p>Here, the God Sambhu is said to have assumed two eyes in protecting the world while his third firey eye clever in consuming the world was now removed in as much as his present work is the protection of the world and not consuming. Hence, we have here the superiority, i.e., the protection of the world with reference to the destruction of the world with the <strong>विषमदृष्टि</strong>uneven eyes or three eyes, and so this is the example of Rūpaka No. 1.</p>
<p>No. 6.</p>
<p>अनुभयताद्रूप्यरूपकम्।</p>
<p>Ex. <strong>अस्या मुखेन्दुना लब्धे नेत्रानन्दे किमिन्दुना।</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Ex. When the delight of (our) eyes has been attained by (seeing) the face-moon of this (lady), what is the good of seeing the moon.</p>
<p>Here, the face of the lady in question is represented as identical with the moon and in the absence of any superiority or of inferiority between them, we have here Rūpaka No. 6.</p>
<p>No. 5.</p>
<p>न्यूनताद्रूप्यरूपकम्।</p>
<p>Ex. <strong>साध्वीयमपरा लक्ष्मीरसुधासागरोदिता॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Ex. This virtuous woman is a second Lakshmī(Goddess of fortune) not born of the Milky Sea.</p>
<p>Here, two different objects, the virtuous woman and the Goddess of fortune, are represented as identical with an inferiority in as much as the former is not born of the Milky Sea and we have therefore here the example of Rūpaka No. 5.</p>
<p>No. 4.</p>
<p>अधिकताद्रूप्यरूपकम्।</p>
<p>Ex. <strong>अयं कलंकिनञ्चन्द्रान्मुखचन्द्रोऽतिरिच्यते।</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Ex. Thisface-moon (of this lovely woman) is superior to the spotted moon.</p>
<p>Here, we have the superiority expressed in the example which needs no comment.</p>
<p><strong>VI.</strong> **परिणामः—**Commutation.</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>परिणामः क्रियार्थश्चेद् विषयी विषयात्मना।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>प्रसन्नेन दृगब्जेन वीक्षते मदिरेक्षणा॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. When the upamāna (i.e., the lotus &amp;c., the object superimposed) is identified with the upameya</p>
<p>(i.e., the eye &amp;c., the subject of superimposition) and serves the purpose on hand (i.e., seeing &amp;c.) it is the Commutation.</p>
<p>Ex. This lady of lovely eyes beholds with her bright eye-lotus.</p>
<p>Here, the superimposed lotus not possessed of the power of beholding is identified with the lady&rsquo;s eye, the subject of superimposition, and is made to serve the purpose on hand, i.e., the act of beholding. In the Rūpaka, as per instance in the sentence<strong>दृगब्जंवीक्षे</strong>I see the eye-lotus,’the imposed lotus served only to gratify the expression. In this figure, the act of seeing belonging to the subject of superimposition, the eye, is transferred to the object superimposed, the lotus, as in the present example.</p>
<p>VII. उल्लेखः—</p>
<p>Representation.</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>बहुभिर्बहुधोल्लेखादेकस्योल्लेख इष्यते।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>स्त्रीभिः कामोऽर्थिभिः स्वर्द्रुः कालः शत्रुभिरैक्षि सः॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. When an object is delineated by different people under different characters, it is termed Representation.</p>
<p>Ex. He (God Kṛishṇa) was regarded as the God of love by the women, as the tree of paradise by the mendicants, and as the God of death by (his) foes.</p>
<p>Here, the one and the same object is represented as distinct by different beholders on different occasions according to their liking or taste.</p>
<p>2nd kind of Representation.</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>एकेन बहुधोल्लेखेऽप्यसौ विषयभेदतः।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>गुरुर्वचस्यर्जुनोऽयं कीर्त्तौभीष्मः शरासने॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. When an object is delineated by one person, i.e., by one perciever, under various characters through difference of peculiarities, it is also termed Representation.</p>
<p>Ex. He (the king) is grave (Bṛihaspati) in speech, white (Arjuna) in fame, and terrible ( Bhīshma ) in bow.</p>
<p>Here, one and the same king is represented as distinct by one and the same beholder but through difference of peculiarities belonging to the object delineated.</p>
<p><strong>VIII. स्मृतिमान्—</strong> Reminiscence or Rhetorical Recollection.</p>
<p><strong>IX. भ्रान्तिमान्</strong>— Mistaker.</p>
<p><strong>X. सन्देहः</strong>—Doubt</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>स्यात् स्मृतिभ्रान्तिसन्देहैस्तदंकालंकृतित्रयम्।</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. (1) Expressions of a certain object capable of arousing an impression in the mind favouring a recollection, (2) mistaking a certain object to be something else similar to it, and (3) doubting the certainty of an object are respectively termed Reminiscence, the Mistaker and Doubt: Or in other words:—</p>
<p>(1) A recollection of an object, experienced before, that arises from the sight of some other object similar to it, is termed Reminiscence.</p>
<p>(2) The Mistaker is the representation of an object, i.e., face &amp;c. as something else, i.e., lotus &amp;c., as suggested by the skill of the poet, on account of the close resemblance of those two objects.</p>
<p>(3) When the certainty of an object under delineation is doubted through poetical skill, it is called Doubt.</p>
<p>Example of Reminiscence.</p>
<p><strong>पंकजं पश्यतः कांतामुखं मे गाहते मनः</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Seeing this lotus, my mind recollects the face of my beloved.</p>
<p>Example of the Mistaker.</p>
<p>अयं प्रमत्तमधुपस्त्वन्मुखं वेत्ति पंकजम्।</p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>(Lady!) this intoxicated bee understands thy face to be the lotus (through mistake).</p>
<p>The difference between this figure and the Rūpaka (V) is, that, in the latter, we identify the face with the lotus without mistaking the one for the other, whereas, in this figure, the mistake is clearly expressed as in the foregoing example.</p>
<p>Example of Doubt.</p>
<p>पंकजं वा सुधांशुर्वेत्यस्माकं तु न निर्णयः।</p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>We are not able to decide whether (the object before us) is the lotus or the moon (nectar-rayed).</p>
<p>Thus, we see that these three figures are founded upon the close resemblance, of the objects seen and experienced before, that gave rise to a recollection, mistake or doubt.</p>
<p><strong>XI. अपह्नुतिः</strong>— Concealment.</p>
<p>There are six varieties of this figure which are:—</p>
<p><strong>1. शुद्धापह्नुतिः</strong>Concealment pure.</p>
<p>**2. हेत्वपह्नुतिः     **Do.    attended with a reason.</p>
<p>**3. पर्यस्तापह्नुतिः   **Do.    transferred.</p>

<p>Ex. <strong>नायं सुधांशुः किं तर्हि व्योमगंगासरोरुहम्॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. <strong>शुद्धापह्नुतिः</strong> is the denial of the real character (of an object on hand such as moon &amp;c.) for the purpose of superimposing (upon it) the character of another (object lotus &amp;c., not on hand).</p>
<p>Ex. This (the object before us) is not the moon (nectar-rayed) but it is the lotus of the celestial Ganges.</p>
<p>2. हेत्वपह्नुतिः</p>
<p>—Concealment with a reason.</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>स एव युक्तिपूर्वश्चेदुच्यते हेत्वपह्नुतिः।</strong></p>

<p>Ex. This is not the moon, (because it is) hot; (not even) the sun, (because it is) night; but it is the submarine fire come out of the ocean.</p>
<p>3. पर्यस्तापह्नुतिः</p>
<p>—Concealment transferred.</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>अन्यत्र तस्यारोपार्थः पर्यस्तापह्नुतिश्च सः।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>नायं सुधांशुः किं तर्हि सुधांशुः प्रेयसीसुखम्॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. <em>Paryastāpahnuti</em> is that in which the real character of an object (moon &amp;c.) is denied and the same is superimposed upon another object (face of a damsel).</p>
<p>Ex. This is not the moon (nectar-rayed). Then which is moon? The face of my beloved is the moon (nectar-rayed— not being endowed with burning character).</p>
<p><strong>4. भ्रान्तापह्नुतिः—</strong> Concealment under a mistake.</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>भ्रान्तापह्नुतिरन्यस्य शंकायां भ्रांतिवारणे।</strong></p>
<p>Ex.<strong>तापं करोति सोत्कम्पं, ज्वरः किं? न सखि स्मरः॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. When a person is in doubt (i.e., under a mistaken notion as to the real character of an object on hand) and when that doubt is warded off (by the mention of the real thing), it is Bhrāntāpahnuti.</p>
<p>Ex. (It) produces heat accompanied by the trembling of the body* Is it fever? + No, friend! It is the God of love.†</p>

<p>DEF.<strong>छेकापह्नुतिरन्यस्य शंकातस्तथ्यनिह्नवे॥</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>प्रजल्पन्मत्पदे लग्नः, कांतः किं? न हि नूपुरः॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. When a person (having once given expression to some real object) denies the same (by interpreting it otherwise) for fear of being understood by another person (in its real sense), it is termed the Concealment of the skilful.</p>
<p>Ex. Pratling (something he) clung to my foot.* Is it thy lover?+ No, no. It is my anklet. †</p>
<p>**6. कैतवापह्नुतिः—**Concealment of the deceitful.</p>

<p>____________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>* Said by a lady to her confidential companion.</p>

<li>Question asked by another lady that chanced to come there at that time.</li>
</ul>
<p>†Reply made by the first lady.</p>
<p>Def. When (the denial of the real character of an object on hand) is clearly expressed by the words of denial<strong>व्याज</strong> etc., it is the Concealment of the deceitful.</p>
<p>Ex. The arrows of the God of love issue forth under the semblence of the glances of a damsel.</p>
<p>** व्याज**= under the semblence of, under the pretext of.</p>
<p><strong>आद्य</strong> etc. includes such other words <strong>मिष, कपट, छल, छद्म, कैतव</strong>।</p>
<p>**XII. उत्प्रेक्षा—**Poetical fancy.</p>
<p>DEF.<strong>संभावना स्यादुत्प्रेक्षा वस्तुहेतुफलात्मना।</strong></p>
<p>**    उक्तानुक्तास्पदाद्यात्रसिद्धासिद्धास्पदे परे॥**</p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. The Poetical fancy is the imagining of an object on hand under the character of another object not on hand under three heads, viz., (1) nature, (2) cause and (3) effect. (And thus the figure is first three-fold). Of these, the first<strong>वस्तूत्प्रेक्षा</strong> qual or as it is generally called<strong>स्वरूपोत्प्रेक्षा</strong>is two-fold according as the occasion of the fancy is mentioned or not mentioned. The other two, i.e., <strong>हेतूत्प्रेक्षा</strong>and <strong>फलोत्प्रेक्षा</strong>are each</p>
<p>two-fold according as the subject of the fancy is an accomplished or unaccomplished one.</p>
<p>** स्वरूपोत्प्रेक्षा**is that in which the state, condition or natural appearance of an object is imagined by the poets to be the state, condition or natural appearance of another similar object.<strong>हेतुत्प्रेक्षा</strong> is that in which something is imagined to be the effect of some other thing which cannot form its real cause. <strong>फलोत्प्रेक्षा</strong> is that in which something is imagined to be the cause of some other thing which is not its real effect.</p>
<p><em>Example of</em><strong>स्वरूपोत्प्रेक्षा</strong>(1) where the occasion ofthe fancy is mentioned.</p>
<p>धूमस्तोमं तमः शंके कोकीविरहशुष्मणाम्।</p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>I suspect (this) darkness to be the mass of smoke of the fire of separation of the kokībirds.</p>
<p>Here, the darkness and the smoke are similar in appearance. The poet is aware that it is darkness. He then fancies it to be the smoke of the fire of separation of the kokībirds which is the occasion of the fancy.</p>
<p><em>Example of</em> <strong>स्वरूपोत्प्रेक्षा</strong>(2) where the occasion of the fancy is not mentioned.</p>
<p>लिम्पतीव तमोङ्गानि वर्षतीवांजनं नभः।</p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Ex. The darkness anoints, as it were, the bodies, (lit. limbs). Sky rains, as it were, the collyrium.</p>
<p>This is the description of the thick darkness of a particular night. In the first sentence, the subject, i.e., the pervasion of darkness which was fancied by the poet as anointing the bodies is not mentioned. In the second sentence too, the pouring down of the darkness which is the subject of the raining of collyrium is not mentioned. Hence we have two instances of <strong>अनुक्तास्पदा वस्तूत्पेक्षा</strong> where the occasion of the fancy is not mentioned.</p>
<p>Ex. <strong>रक्तौ तवांघ्रीमृदुलौ भुवि विक्षेपणाद्ध्रुवम्।</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>(Oh! Lady), thy soft feet have become red certainly by their treading on the floor.</p>
<p>Here, the treading on the floor is fancied as a cause for the natural redness of the lady&rsquo;s feet; and the redness being an accomplished one, this is an instance of <strong>सिद्धास्पदा हेतूत्प्रेक्षा।</strong></p>
<p>Ex.<strong>त्वन्मुखाभेच्छयानूनं पद्मैर्वैरायते शशी।</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Oh! Damsel, the moonrivals with the lotuses, surely, with a desire of attaining the loveliness of thy face.</p>
<p>Here, the enmity, between the moon and the lotuses, on account of the latter&rsquo;s contraction on the appearance of the former, is natural, and the cause ascribed to it, i.e., with a desire of attaining the beauty of the lady&rsquo;s face is not real and is due to the fancy of the poet. The cause not being an established one, this forms an instance of <strong>असिद्धास्पदा हेतूत्प्रेक्षा</strong>।</p>
<p>Ex.<strong>मध्यः किं कुचयोर्धृत्यै बद्धः कनकदामभिः।</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Lady! Is it for the support of thy breasts that thy waist was tied by the golden strings (in the form of the lady&rsquo;s foldings)?</p>
<p>Here, the lady&rsquo;s breasts are naturally placed above the waist; whereas, the poet describes the natural goldlike folds over the navel of the lady as three golden strings tied round the waist as if to support the breasts. The fact being an accomplished one, this is an instance of <strong>सिद्धविषया फलोत्प्रेक्षा</strong>।</p>
<p>Ex. <strong>प्रायोऽब्जंत्वत्पदेनैक्यं प्राप्तुं तोये तपस्यति।</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Lady! the lotus does penance in the water perhaps to become identical with thy foot.</p>
<p>Here, the lotuses naturally grow in water, and the poet artfully attributes another cause for their</p>
<p>standing in the water, which is no doubt the work of his imagination; and this being an unaccomplished one, it is an instance of <strong>असिद्धविषया फलोत्पेक्षा</strong>।</p>
<p><strong>XIII. अतिशयोक्तिः—</strong> Hyperbole.</p>
<p>There are seven kinds of this figure:—</p>
<p><strong>1. रूपकातिशयोक्तिः</strong>Hyperbole Metaphorical.</p>
<p><strong>2. भेदकाति०</strong>        Do.    asserting a difference.</p>
<p>**3. संबन्धा०         **Do.    asserting a connection.</p>
<p>**4. असंबन्धा०       **Do.    asserting a disconnection.</p>
<p>**5. अक्रमा०         **Do.    asserting a want of order.</p>
<p><strong>6. चपला०</strong>          Do.   asserting fickleness.</p>
<p>**7. अत्यन्ता०        **Do.    of the highest degree.</p>
<p>Of these, No. 1 is two-fold.(a) <strong>शुद्धा</strong>—Pure and (b) <strong>सापह्नवा</strong>—founded upon the ornament of Concealment (XI).</p>
<p>1 (a) <strong>शुद्धा रूपकातिशयोक्तिः।</strong></p>
<p>DEF. <strong>रूपकातिशयोक्तिः स्यान्निगीर्याध्यवसानतः।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>पश्य नीलोत्पलद्वंद्वान्निःसरंति शिताः शराः॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. When the object on hand (i.e., face &amp;c. the upameya) is swallowed up, or completely taken in, by the upamāna &lsquo;moon &amp;c.&rsquo; through introsusception, and the upameya is therefore comprehended as upamāna itself, or, in other words, (when the upamāna is used for upameya), it is called &lsquo;Hyperbole Metaphorical&rsquo;.</p>
<p>** निगीर्य**is indeclinable past participle in <strong>य</strong>of the root <strong>गृृ</strong>with <strong>नि</strong> &rsquo;to devour&rsquo;. <strong>अध्यवसानतः = अध्यवसान+तस्अध्यवसान</strong> is the abstract noun formed by adding the affix <strong>अन</strong> to the root <strong>सो</strong> with prepositions <strong>अधि</strong> and <strong>अव</strong>, and <strong>तस्</strong> is a termination of the ablative case.</p>
<p>** अध्यवसान** means the identification of two objects of which the one is the object on hand and the other not on hand in such a manner that the former is com- pletely absorbed into the latter.</p>
<p>When a man comprehends the face of a damsel as moon itself and calls it by the word &lsquo;moon&rsquo; without mentioning the proper word ‘face&rsquo;, then the face ‘upameya&rsquo; is said to have been <em>swallowed up</em> by the moon &lsquo;upamāna&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Ex. Behold! There issue forth sharpened shafts from a pair of blue lotuses.</p>
<p>Here, the speaker, instead of saying<strong>पश्यकान्ताक्षियुग्मात् कटाक्षा निःसरन्त्यहो</strong> there issue forth ogles or side— glances from a pair of eyes of this lovely woman who was before him, says thus by using the upamāna words <strong>नीलोत्पल</strong>&lsquo;blue lotus&rsquo; and <strong>शराः</strong>‘shafts’ for their corresponding upameya words the <strong>अक्षि</strong>‘eye&rsquo; and<strong>कटाक्षः</strong>‘ogles&rsquo;. Thus, we have the introsusception of the eyes and the ogles of a beloved lady in</p>
<p>the blue lotuses and shafts with which they are respectively identified.*</p>
<p>1 (b)</p>
<p>सापह्नवा रूपकातिशयोक्तिः।</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>यद्यपह्नुतिगर्भत्वं सैव सापह्नुवा मता।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>त्वत्सूक्तिषु सुधा राजन् भ्रांताः पश्यंति तां विधौ॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. If the same, i.e., the Metaphorical Hyperbole No. 1 (a) is founded upon the ornament of Concealment, then it is called <strong>सापह्नवा रूपकातिशयोक्तिः।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. O king! Nectar exists in thy good speeches; but the infatuated people see the same in the moon.</p>
<p>Here, &rsquo;the sweetness in the good speeches of the king is the nectar&rsquo;— is the Hyperbole No. 1 (a); because the upamāna &rsquo;nectar&rsquo; is used for upameya ‘sweetness’. Again, the nectar which is in the moon is denied and that which exists in the good speeches of the king is called nectar and hence we have the ornament of Concealment also.</p>
<p>__________________________________________________________</p>
<p>* This comprehension brings about the superior excellence of the upameya over the upamāna.</p>
<p>2. भेदकातिशयोक्तिः।</p>
<p>DEF.<strong>भेदकातिशयोक्तिस्तु तस्यैवान्यत्ववर्णनम्।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>अन्यदेवास्य गांभीर्यमन्यद्धैर्यं महीपतेः॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. When the thing described is comprehended as another, i.e., as extraordinary or strange or peculiar, it is called <strong>भेदकातिशयोक्तिः</strong>।</p>
<p>Ex. Strange is the profundity of this king and strange is his courage also.</p>
<p>Here, the profundity and the courage of the king are considered as extraordinary because a difference is asserted between the profundity and courage of an ordinary man and those of the king.</p>
<p>3. संबन्धातिशयोक्तिः।</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>संबंधातिशयोक्तिः स्यादयोगे योगकल्पनम्।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>सौधाग्राणि पुरस्यास्य स्पृशंति विधुमंडलम्॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. When a connection is asserted where there is really none, it is called <strong>संबन्धातिशयोक्तिः।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. The tops of the mansions of this town kiss the disc of the moon.</p>
<p>Here, the tops do not really touch the disc of the moon; still they are asserted to do so on account of their extraordinary height.</p>
<p>4. असंबन्धातिशयोक्तिः।</p>
<p>DEF.<strong>योगेऽप्ययोगोऽसंबंधातिशयोक्तिरितीर्यते।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>त्वयि दातरि राजेन्द्र स्वर्द्रुमान्नाद्रियामहे॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. Denial of connection where there is really a connection is called <strong>असंबन्धातिशयोक्तिः।</strong></p>
<p>** **Ex. O best of kings! As long as thou remainest here, as our liberal donor, we won&rsquo;t devote ourselves to the wish-yielding trees of Indra&rsquo;s paradise.</p>
<p>This is addressed by the mendicants to a king of very liberal donations. They, the mendicants, say that as long as this king is their donor, they sever their connection with the Kalpa tree. Here, the connection of the mendicants with their wish-yielding tree which is, as its very name implies, renowned for its liberality is denied.</p>
<p>5. अक्रमातिशयोक्तिः।</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>अक्रमातिशयोक्तिः स्यात्सहत्वे हेतुकार्ययोः।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>आलिंगन्ति समं देव ज्यां शराश्च पराश्च ते॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. When the cause and effect are said to have taken place simultaneously, or, in other words, when the effect is said to co-exist with the cause, it is called <strong>अक्रमातिशयोक्तिः।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. O king! Thy arrows and thy foes both clasp the <em>jyā</em>simultaneously.</p>
<p>Observe the pun on the word jyā which means ‘bow-string&rsquo; and ‘earth.’ The arrows are said to clasp the bow-string, and the foes, the earth, <em>i.e</em>., they fall down on earth dead being struck with the arrows of the king. It is usual that cause precedes the effect. Here, the effect, the falling down dead on earth, is said to co-exist with the cause, the issuing of anarrow. Hence, it is called <strong>अक्रमातिशयोक्तिः।</strong></p>
<p>6. चपलातिशयोक्तिः।</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>चपलातिशयोक्तिस्तु कार्य्येहेतुप्रसक्तिजे।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>यास्यामीत्युदिते तन्व्याबलयोऽभवदूर्मिका॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. If the effect is described to have taken place without the cause, or, literally, if the effect is said to have taken place when the cause was under discussion, i.e., not yet begun, it is then called<strong>चपलातिशयोक्तिः।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. No sooner did the lover say &lsquo;I shall go&rsquo; than the ring of his slender lady became her bracelet.</p>
<p>When the lover simply said &lsquo;I shall go&rsquo; but did not actually go, his beloved became so very thin at the very thought of her lover&rsquo;s future separation that the ring of her finger served as bracelet for her hand. Here, the cause was only expressed but did not actually take place and we see the effect is pro-duced without the cause.</p>
<p>7. अत्यन्तातिशयोक्तिः।</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>अत्यन्तातिशयोक्तिस्तत्पौर्वापर्यव्यतिक्रमे।</strong></p>
<p>Ex.<strong>अग्रे मानो गतः पश्चादनुनीता प्रियेण सा॥</strong></p>
<p>________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>* Is explained by the commentator as हेत्वभावे— without cause.</p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. When the relation of priority and posteriority is violated, i.e., when the due order is inverted, or, in other words, when the effect is said to have preceded the cause, it is <strong>अत्यन्तातिशयोक्तिः।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. The anger (of the beloved lady) had previously subsided. Afterwards, she was conciliated by her lover.</p>
<p>Here, a lady angry, through love, at the absence of her lover removed her anger at the moment the lover came before her. The lover not knowing the subsidence of the anger of the lady excused himself of his absence which was unnecessary at that stage.</p>
<p><strong>XIV. तुल्ययोगिता—</strong>&lsquo;Equal Pairing&rsquo;.</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>वर्ण्यानामितरेषां वा धर्मैक्यं तुल्ययोगिता।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>संकुचंति सरोजानि स्वैरिणौवदनानि च॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>* तत्= तयोःof those, i.e., of the cause and effect.</p>
<p>Def. The sameness of attribute of objects on hand or of objects not on hand, is called <strong>तुल्ययोगिता।</strong></p>
<p>Example of objects on hand.</p>
<p>The lotuses become contracted as well as the faces of the adulterous women.</p>
<p>This being the description of the rise of the moon, the lotuses are said to contract; and the moonlight being an impediment to the free movements of the harlots, their faces also are said to contract or droop.</p>
<p>Observe:— Here, the lotuses and the faces of the women are the objects on hand and are associated with one common attribute.</p>
<p>Example of objects that are not on hand.</p>
<p>त्वदंगमार्दवे दृष्टे कस्य चित्ते न भासते।<br>
मालतीशशभृल्लेखा कदलीनां कठोरता॥</p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Ex. Lady! In whose mind will not the hardness of the jasamine, the lunar ray and the plantain be manifest when the softness of thy limbs was perceived?</p>
<p>Here, the jasamine &amp;c., the objects unconnected with the subject, are associated with one and the same attribute, that is, the quality of hardness.</p>
<p><em>Equal Pairing, second kind.</em></p>
<p>DEF. <strong>हिताहिते वृत्तितौल्यमपरा तुल्ययोगिता।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>प्रदीयते पराभूतिर्मित्रशात्रवयोस्त्वया॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. The description of the sameness of behaviour towards a friend and a foe is another kind of Equal Pairing.</p>
<p>Ex. (O king!), Parābūti is equally distributed by thee both to thy friend and to thy foe.</p>
<p>** परा** and <strong>भूतिः</strong>are two separate words meaning immense riches when applied to &lsquo;friend&rsquo;; when taken as one word, <strong>पराभूतिः</strong>means &lsquo;defeat&rsquo; and applies to ‘foe’ however the same word being used to friend and foe, this must be taken as instancing the figure without referring to its meaning.</p>
<p>Observe:—This is possible only under a pun.</p>
<p>Equal Pairing, third kind.</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>गुणोत्कृष्टैःसमीकृत्य वचोऽन्या तुल्ययोगिता।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>लोकपालोयमः पाशी श्रीदः शक्रो भवानपि॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. The description of placing one object on a footing of equality with those possessed of superior qualities is termed a third kind of Equal Pairing.</p>
<p>Ex. (O Lord!), Yama, Pāsī, Srīda, Sakra as well as thyself are each a Lokapāla.</p>
<p>Lokapāla= a regent or guardian of a quarter= a ruler of earth.</p>
<p>Yama= the God of death, the regent of the Southern quarter.</p>
<p>Pāsī= Varuna, the regent of the Western quarter and of the oceans.</p>
<p>Srīda= Kubera, the regent of the Northern quarter and the God of riches and treasure.</p>
<p>Sakra= Indra, the regent of the Eastern quarter and the king of the Gods.</p>
<p><strong>XV. दीपकम्</strong>—The &lsquo;Illuminator&rsquo;.</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>वदंति वर्ण्यावर्ण्यानां धर्मैक्यं दीपकं बुधाः।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>मदेन भाति कलभः प्रतापेन महीपतिः॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. When objects on hand and those not on hand are associated with a common attribute (mentioned only once), the learned call it the Illuminator.</p>
<p>Ex. The young elephant shines by its ichor and this lord of earth by his valour.</p>
<p>Here, the elephant, the object not on hand, and the king, the object on hand, are together associated with one and the same attribute, <em>the action of shining.</em> Just as a lamp standing in one place illumines the several objects round it, so in the present figure one finite verb serves as predicate to two or more nominatives. Compare the maxim of the lamp placed over a threshold <strong>देहलीदीपन्यायः</strong>। It takes its origin from a lamp hanging over the threshold of a house which, by its peculiar position, serves to light the rooms on both sides, and is used to denote something which serves a two-fold purpose at the same time. <em>Apte.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>*In the Equal Pairing No. 1 (Fig. XIV), the objects on hand if associated with one and the same attribute formed one kind of the figure; and the objects not on hand if associated with one and the same attribute formed another kind of the same figure (observe the word <strong>वा</strong>in the Definition). In the Illuminator, the objects on hand and those not on hand are <em>together</em></li>
</ul>
<p>associated with one common attribute mentioned only once.</p>
<p>XVI. आवृत्तिदीपकम्</p>
<p>—The Illuminator by repetition.</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>त्रिविधं दीपकावृत्तौ भवेदावृत्तिदीपकम्।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>वर्षत्यंबुदमालेयं वर्षत्येषा च शर्वरी॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>** त्रिविधम्** i.e, by repetition of 1 <strong>पद</strong> &lsquo;word&rsquo;, 2 <strong>अर्थ</strong> ‘signification&rsquo; and 3 <strong>उभय</strong> &lsquo;both word and signification&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Def. By repetition of (1) word, (2) signification and (3) both, we have the three kinds of the figure <strong>आवृत्तिदीपकम्।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. This range of clouds rains and this night looks like a year.</p>
<p><em>This is the example of No. 1</em> <strong>पदावृत्ति</strong>। Here, the verb <strong>वर्षति</strong>, a <strong>पद</strong>, is repeated though with different significations. The first is the form of the third person, singular number, present tense of the root <strong>वृष्</strong>‘to rain&rsquo;, and the second is the form of the third person, singular number, present tense of the nominal verb derived from the noun <strong>वर्ष</strong> &rsquo; a year&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>Example of No. 2.</em> <strong>अर्थावृत्ति।</strong></p>
<p><strong>उन्मीलंति कदंबानि स्फुटंति कुटजद्रुमाः।</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Ex. The kadamba flowers blossom and the kutaja creepers bloom forth.</p>
<p><strong>उन्मीलन्ति</strong> and <strong>स्फुटन्ति</strong></p>
<p>mean the same thing and we have here a repetition of signification.</p>
<p><em>Example of No. 3.</em> <strong>उभयावृत्ति।</strong></p>
<p>माद्यन्ति चातकास्तृप्ता माद्यंति च शिखावलाः।</p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Ex. The satiated chātaka birds rejoice and the peacocks also rejoice (at the sight of the clouds).</p>
<p>Here, the same word <strong>माद्यन्ति</strong> is repeated in the same meaning and hence it is called <strong>उभयावृत्तिदीपकम्।</strong></p>
<p><strong>XVII. प्रतिवस्तूपमा</strong>—Typical Comparison.</p>
<p>DEF.<strong>वाक्ययोरेकसामान्ये प्रतिवस्तूपमा मता।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>तापेन भ्राजते सूरः शूरश्चापेन राजते॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. When, in two sentences one of which describes the object compared and the other the object compared to, the same common attribute is expressed <em>but by different words,</em> it is termed Typical Comparison.</p>
<p>Ex. The sun shines with intense heat and this warrior looks brilliant with his bow.</p>
<p>Here, the actions of shining and looking brilliant, though mean the same thing, are expressed by different words to avoid the fault of repetition.</p>
<p><strong>XVIII दृष्टान्तः</strong>— Exemplification.</p>
<p>DEF.<strong>चेद्बिम्बप्रतिबिंबत्वं दृष्टांतस्तदलंकृतिः।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>त्वमेव कीर्त्तिमान् राजन् विधुरेव हि कांतिमान्॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. If two sentences, one of which contains the object compared and the other the object compared to, stand in relation of type and proto-type, or, in other words, contain similar attributes reflectively expressed, it is called Exemplification.</p>
<p>Ex. O king! Thou art the only being possessed of fame and the moon is the only object having radiance.</p>
<p>Here, <em>possessing fame and having radiance</em> are similar attributes and the two sentences stand in relation of type and proto-type. The first sentence is exemplified by the second in which a renowned object, the moon, whose radiance has been experienced</p>
<p>__________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>* Taken from the preceding verse.</p>
<p>as excellent, is employed as a type. The difference between this figure and <strong>प्रतिवस्तूपमा</strong>is that the common attributes here are similar but in the latter they are identical. In the<strong>प्रतिवस्तूपमा</strong> the couple of sentences terminates in conveying the same sense; whilst in the example of the present figure the sentences have similar sense reflectively expressed and not the same.</p>
<p><strong>XIX. निदर्शना।</strong> Illustration (First kind.)</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>वाक्यार्थयोः सदृशयोरैक्यारोपो निदर्शना।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>या दातुः सौम्यता सेयं पूर्णेन्दोरकलंकता॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. A description, resulting in the identity of the significations, of two sentences, which are similar, i.e., which terminate in a comparison or similarity, is called Illustration.</p>
<p>Ex. That mild nature if possessed by a donor answers to the stainlessness of the full moon.*</p>
<p>Here, the impossibility of the existence of the full moon without the black spot corresponds to the</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________</p>
<p>*In Sanskṛit, the relative and corrolative clauses are reckoned as two separate sentences.</p>
<p>non-existence of a donor destitude of anger. Thus, we see that the two sentences terminate in a comparison.</p>
<p>The difference between this figure and the <strong>दृष्टान्त XVII</strong> is that in<strong>दृष्टान्त</strong> similar attributes are stated whereas here they are not stated. Here, the two sentences employed are dependent upon each other in their meanings but in the<strong>दृष्टान्त</strong> they are independent.</p>
<p>2nd kind of Illustration.</p>
<p>DEF.<strong>पदार्थवृत्तिमप्येके वदंत्यन्यां निदर्शनाम्।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>त्वन्नेत्रयुगलं धत्ते लीलां नीलांबुजन्मनोः॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. If a thing is described as bearing the property of another, then it is another kind of Illustration according to certain writers on Rhetoric.</p>
<p>Ex. (Lady!) Thy two eyes bear the charmingness of the two blue lotuses.</p>
<p>3rd kind of Illustration.</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>अपरां बोधनं प्राहुः क्रिययासत्सदर्थयोः।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>नश्येद्राजविरोधीति क्षीणं चन्द्रोदये तमः॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. The intimation, by an agent engaged in a certain action, of the unreal and the real state of things signified by the action itself, it is termed the third kind of Illustration.</p>
<p>Ex. “The enemy of a king (moon) will perish”—telling this, the darkness, on the rise of the moon, vanished.</p>
<p>Here, the darkness is the agent in the act of intimating to the world the above fact, the result of its own experience which is certainly unreal. This forms the example of unreal state of things.</p>
<p>Example of the real state of things:—</p>
<p>उदयन्नेव सविता पद्मेष्वर्पयति श्रियम्।<br>
विभावयन्समृद्धीनां फलं सुहृदनुग्रहम्॥</p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Ex. &lsquo;The chief object of one&rsquo;s having riches consists in rewarding his friends&rsquo;— thus intimating(to the</p>
<p>world), the sun, just on its rise, consigns its own treasures (splendour) to the lotuses.</p>
<p>Here, the sun is the agent in the act of intimating to the world the above fact which is real as the lotuses bloom only on the rise of the sun.</p>
<p><strong>XX. व्यतिरेकः</strong>— Dissimilitude or Contrast.</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>व्यतिरेको विशेषश्चेदुपमानोपमेययोः।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>शैला इवोन्नताः संतः किंतु प्रकृतिकोमलाः॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. If any characterestic difference is asserted between the object compared to and that compared, then it is called Dissimilitude or Contrast.</p>
<p>Ex. Good men are as high as mountains; but they (good men) are delicate by nature.</p>
<p>Here, we see a similitude between the good men, upameya, and the mountains, upamāna, in one respect and a dissimilitude in another respect.</p>
<p><strong>XXI. सहोक्तिः।<strong>Connected Description or a Speech with</strong>सह</strong>&lsquo;with&rsquo;.</p>
<p>DEE. <strong>सहोक्तिः सहभावश्चेद्भासते जनरंजनः।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>दिगंतमगमत्तस्य कीर्त्तिः प्रत्यर्थिभिः सह॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. A description of simultaneity or conjunction which will excite a pleasing (poetical) delight in the people&rsquo;s (mind) is called the Connected Description.</p>
<p>Ex. The fame of that king has reached the end of the quarters together with his foes.</p>
<p>Here, the reaching of the fame to the end of the quarters is directly expressed and that of the foes is indirectly expressed by the word <strong>सह। सह</strong> denotes simultaneity of two actions that are of one and the same kind. The idea conveyed in the present example is that both the king&rsquo;s fame and the enemies reached the end of the quarters at the same time. Thus we see that this figure consists in the description of simultaneous action connected with<strong>सह।</strong></p>
<p>**XXII. विनोक्तिः—**Speech of Absence or Speech with <strong>विना</strong>&lsquo;without&rsquo;.</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>विनोक्तिश्चेद्विना किंचित्प्रस्तुतं हीनमुच्यते।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>विद्या हृद्यापि साऽवद्या विना विनयसंपदम्॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. When an object on hand is represented as inferior in the absence of some other object, it is termed the Speech of Absence.</p>
<p>Ex. In the absence of excellent good behaviour, the learning, though pleasing, is censurable.</p>
<p>Speech of Absence, second kind.</p>
<p>DEP. <strong>तच्चेत्किंचिद्विना रम्यं विनोक्तिः सापि कथ्यते।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>विना खलैर्विभात्येषा राजेंद्र भवतः सभा॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. When an object on hand is represented as charming in the absence of some other object, it is also called Speech of Absence.</p>
<p>Ex. O best of kings! Thy council hall shines splendid in the absence of wicked persons.</p>
<p>**XXIII. समासोक्तिः—**Modal Metaphor or Speech of Brevity.</p>
<p>DEF.<strong>समासोक्तिः परिस्फूर्त्तिः प्रस्तुतेऽप्रस्तुतस्य चेत्।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>अयमैंद्रीमुखं पश्य रक्तश्चुंबति चंद्रमाः॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. If, by the description of an object on hand, an object not on hand is apprehended, or in other words, when the description of an object on hand conveys a reference to an object not on hand, it is called Modal Metaphor.</p>
<p>Ex. My beloved! see, this moon becoming red kisses the face of the Eastern (Indra&rsquo;s) quarter.</p>
<p>Here, by the use of the words—(1) <strong>चुम्बति</strong> the action of which belongs to a human being, (2) <strong>चन्द्रमाः</strong>in the masculine gender and (3) <strong>ऐन्द्री</strong> in the feminine gender, we understand that a lover, the subject of discourse, out of passion, kisses the face of some beautiful damsel residing in the east.</p>
<p><strong>XXIV. परिकरः</strong>—Insinuator.</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>अलंकारः परिकरः साभिप्राये विशेषणे।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>सुधांशुकलितोत्तंसस्तापं हरतु वः शिवः॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. A speech with epithets signifying the import (of the speaker) is termed Insinuator.</p>
<p>Ex. Let God Siva whose crest has been adorned with nectar-rayed (moon) remove your misery (lit. mental heat).</p>
<p>Here, the charming epithet <strong>सुधांशुकलितोत्तंसः</strong> suggests that the heat is removable. This figure occurs even when only one epithet is employed and when that epithet invests the verse with a peculiar charm agreeable to the effect like the present one.</p>
<p><strong>XXV. परिकरांकुरः—</strong> Sprout of an Insinuator.</p>
<p>DEF.<strong>साभिप्राये विशेष्ये तु भवेत्परिकरांकुरः।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>चतुर्णांपुरुषार्थानां दाता देवश्चतुर्भुजः॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. When the noun itself (i.e., without epithets) signifies the import of the speaker, it is called the Sprout of an Insinuator.</p>
<p>Ex. The four-armed God (Vishṇu) is the giver of the four principal objects of life.</p>
<p>Four objects of life are <strong>धर्मः</strong>&lsquo;merit&rsquo;, <strong>अर्थः</strong>&lsquo;wealth&rsquo;, <strong>कामः</strong>‘enjoyment&rsquo; and <strong>मोक्षः</strong>&rsquo;liberation&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Here, the word <strong>चतुर्भुजः</strong>is one of the thousand names of the Lord Vishṇu and is used here without epithets. The import of the speaker is that God Vishṇu alone (being four-armed) is able to distribute the four objects of life.</p>
<p><strong>XXVI.</strong> **श्लेषः—**Paronomasia.</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>नानार्थसंश्रयः श्लेषो वर्ण्यावर्ण्योभयास्पदः।</strong></p>
<p>Ex.<strong>सर्वदो माधवः पायात् स यो गंगामदीधरत्॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. Paronomasia is the expression by words having more than one signification referring (1) to an object on hand, (2) to an object not on hand and (3) to both.</p>
<p>Ex. The all-giver Mādhava who held up the mountain (Govardhana on his head) and the earth may protect (you).</p>
<p>The husband of Umā (Siva) who bore (on his head) the river Ganges may protect (you).</p>
<p>** सर्वदो माधवः**may be split into (1) <strong>सर्वदःमाधवः</strong>and (2) <strong>सर्वदा उमाधवः</strong> ।</p>
<p>** यो गंगाम्** may be split into (1) <strong>यःअगं गाम्</strong> and (2) <strong>यः गंगाम्</strong>।</p>
<p>Here, both Mādhava and Umādhava are objects on hand and this is therefore the <em>Example of No.</em> 1.</p>
<p>Example of No. 2.</p>
<p>अब्जेन त्वन्मुखं तुल्यं हरिणाहितसक्तिना।</p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>(Lady!) thy face resembles the moon having an attachment effected by the deer (in the form of the spot).</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>(Lady!) thy face resembles the lotus having an attachment effected by the sun (in the act of blooming at the dawn).</p>
<p>Here,<strong>अब्ज</strong>moon&rsquo; and<strong>अब्ज</strong>&rsquo;lotus&rsquo; which are upamānas are both objects not on hand.</p>
<p>Example of No. 3.</p>
<p>उच्चरद्भूरिकीलालः शुशुभे वाहिनीपतिः।</p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>The commander of the army, Bhīshma, shone by the profuse effusion of blood</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>The Lord of the rivers, the ocean, shone by the vast expanse of water.</p>
<p>Here, the commander Bhīshma is the object on hand and the ocean is the object not on hand.</p>
<p>**XXVII. अप्रस्तुतप्रशंसा—**Indirect Description.</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>अप्रस्तुतप्रशंसा स्यात् सा यत्र प्रस्तुताश्रया।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>एकःकृती शकुंतेषु योऽन्यं शक्रान्न याचते॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. When the description of an object not on hand conveys a reference to an object on hand, it is called Indirect Description.</p>
<p>Ex. (The chātaka bird) is the only fortunate one, among the birds, which never begs of any other than Indra.</p>
<p>It is a known fact that chātaka bird lives on rain drops and that Indra is the bestower of rain.</p>
<p>Here, the object in question is a noble man who never begs of any man except the Indra-like king and this is conveyed through the description of a chātaka bird which is not the object on hand.</p>
<p>This is not <strong>समासोक्ति</strong> where a description of an object on hand conveys a reference to an object not on hand; whilst, in this figure, it is quite contrary.</p>
<p><strong>XXVIII. प्रस्तुतांकुरः—</strong> The Sprout of Direct Description.</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>प्रस्तुतेन प्रस्तुतस्य द्योतने प्रस्तुतांकुरः।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>किं भृंग सत्यां मालत्यां केतक्या कण्टकेद्धया॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. When the description of an object on hand conveys a reference to another object on hand, it is called Prastutānkura.</p>
<p>Ex. O Bee! What (is the use of thy amusement) with the (unblown) Ketakīfull of thorns while thou hast here the Mālatī(Jasamine) flower.</p>
<p>Here, a lady, by the description of the bee&rsquo;s act with the unblown Ketakībud witnessed by her in her pleasure garden indirectly intimates the same to her lover, the subject of discourse, who is at present in love with a maiden who has not yet arrived at puberty.</p>
<ul>
<li>N. B.—* The bee and the lover are both objects on hand.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>XXIX. पर्य्यायोक्तम्—</strong> Periphrasis.</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>पर्य्यायोक्तं तु गम्यस्य वचो भंग्यंतराश्रयम्।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>नमस्तस्मैकृतौ येन मुधा राहुवधूकुचौ॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. When a fact intended to be intimated is conveyed by a circumlocutory speech, or in other words, when a fact intended to be described is expressed by a turn of speech, or, if the intended fact is expressed in a different manner, it is Periphrasis.</p>
<p>Ex. Homage to him (God Vishṇu) by whom the breasts of Rāhu&rsquo;s spouse were rendered useless.</p>
<p>Here, the intended fact is that homage is to the God Vishṇu only, because he was the killer of Rāhu and thus rendered the breasts of Rāhu&rsquo;s spouse useless and this fact has been expressed by a turn of</p>
<p>speech, i.e., by different words which do not express it but by words which suggest it, simply for the purpose of giving a particular strikingness to the description.</p>
<p>Periphrasis— A second kind.</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>पर्य्यायोक्तं तदप्याहुर्यद्व्याजेनेष्टसाधनम्।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>यामि चूतलतां द्रष्टुं युवाभ्यामास्यतामिह॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. Even the fulfilment of one&rsquo;s own wish under an artful pretext of doing some thing else is also called Periphrasis by some.</p>
<p>Ex. Lovers! I depart hence for the purpose of seeing (my) mango creeper and it shall be stayed here by you both.</p>
<p>Here, the speaker is a female messenger who having united her mistress with her intended lover departs from that place under the pretext of seeing her own chūta creeper so that the couple may freely enjoy in the absence of a third person.</p>
<p><strong>XXX. व्याजस्तुतिः—</strong> Artful Praise or Irony.</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>उक्तिर्व्याजस्तुतिर्निंदास्तुतिभ्यां स्तुतिनिंन्दयोः।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>कः स्वर्धुनि! विवेकस्ते नयसे पापिनो दिवम्॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. when (1) the praise is understood by apparent censure and (2) censure by apparent praise, it is termed Artful Praise.</p>
<p>Ex. O celestial river Gangā! Thou art devoid of judgment in that thou conveyest the sinners to the heaven.</p>
<p>This is the example of No. 1.</p>
<p>Here, the real praise has resulted by the apparent censure and it consists in representing the Gangā as taking the sinners to heaven provided they once bathe in her waters.</p>
<ul>
<li>N. B.—* <strong>व्याजस्तुतिः= व्याजेन स्तुतिः</strong> Praise by an artifice—<em>when praise is understood by apparent censure</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When censure is understood by apparent praise, <strong>व्याजस्तुतिः</strong> is explained as <strong>व्याजरूपा स्तुतिः</strong> praise consisting in an artifice or a pretended praise.</p>
<p>Example of No. 2.</p>
<p>साधु दूति पुनः साधु कर्तव्यं किमतःपरम्।<br>
यन्मदर्थे विलूनासि दंतैरपि नखैरपि॥</p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Well (done) messenger! what other good than this can again be done; because thou, on my account, wast injured even by (my lover&rsquo;s) teeth and nails.</p>
<p>Here, the speaker a lady pining under separation sent her maid-servant as a messenger to her lover and on seeing her returning with marks, in her body, of her having toyed with her (lady&rsquo;s) lord, censures her under pretext of Praise saying that she (lady) was saved by her (the maid servant) from the injury by her lord&rsquo;s teeth and nails; whereas in fact she was angry when she saw her servant coming single without her lord and was more angry when she observed on her body the marks of sexual intercourse with her own lord. Hence a censure resulted in theapparent praise.</p>
<ul>
<li>N.B.—*This is not <strong>अप्रस्तुतप्रशंसा(XXVII)</strong>, for, in it, there is no strikingness consisting either in censure or praise.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>XXXI.व्याजनिन्दा</strong>—Artful Censure.</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>निंदाया निंदया व्यक्तिर्व्याजनिंदेति गीयते।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>विधे स निंद्यो यस्ते प्रागेकमेवाहरच्छिरः॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. When an apparent censure (of an object not on hand) results in the censure (of an object not on hand), it is Artful Censure.</p>
<p>Ex. O Creator! he (Siva) is to be censured— he that has lopped off only one head of thine formerly.</p>
<p>Here, the speaker, a poor man in very distressed circumstances, fancies himself that, if all the five heads of the God Brahmā were lopped off by Siva, then both the creator and the sufferings of the created would have been simultaneously put an end to. Instead of directly censuring the God Brahmā, the creator, the object on hand, the speaker censured the God Siva, the object not on hand, in having imprudently suffered the other four heads of Brahmā to remain.</p>
<p><strong>XXXII. आक्षेपः</strong>— Hint.</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>आक्षेपःस्वयमुक्तस्य प्रतिषेधोविचारणात्।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>चंद्र! संदर्शयात्मानमथवास्ति प्रियामुखम्॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. A denial, after some deliberation, of what has been expressed, is called Hint.</p>
<p>Ex. O moon! Discover thy self (to me). Why? Here is the face of (my) beloved.</p>
<p>Here, we see only a semblance of denial. This figure is distinct from the Concealment (<strong>XI</strong>) where the property of an object on hand is denied and that of another not on hand is superimposed upon it.</p>
<p>A second kind of Hint.</p>
<p>DEE. <strong>निषेधाभासमाक्षेपं बुधाःकेचन मन्वते।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>नाहं दूतीतनोस्तापस्तस्याः कालानलोपमः॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. Some learned peopleregard the semblance but of a denial as the figure Hint.</p>
<p>Ex. I am no go-between love-fever (residing in) her (mistress&rsquo;) body, resembling the destructive fire at the end of the world.</p>
<p>Here, the character of a person— that of the go-between, is denied. The fact of excessive hardship, experienced by the lady under the pangs of separation, which was intended to be conveyed by the go-between, the speaker, is suppressed in order to suggest more strikingly that the lady is sure to die if her lover delays even for a moment in meeting her.</p>
<p>A third kind of Hint.</p>
<p>DEE. <strong>आक्षेपोऽन्यो विधौ व्यक्ते निषेधे च तिरोहिते।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>गच्छ गच्छसि चेत्कांत!तत्रैव स्याज्जनिर्मम॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. When the permission (to do some thing) is apparent (in words) but the denial (to do that thing) is hidden, it is a third kind of Hint.</p>
<p>Ex. Departest (thou), my love, if thou art determined to go, and may my rebirth take place in that same place (where thou hast gone).</p>
<p>Here, the apparent permission of going granted by the lady suggests a clear prohibition, the meaning conveyed thereby being that the lover ought to desist from departing from her presence.</p>
<p><strong>XXXIII. विरोधाभासः</strong> or <strong>विरोधः</strong>— Contradiction.</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>आभासत्वे विरोधस्य विरोधाभास इष्यते।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>विनापि तन्वि!हारेण वक्षोजौ तव हारिणौ॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. When an incongruity (between two things) is apparent (in words*), then it is called Contradiction.</p>
<p>Ex. O slender lady! thy breasts though devoid of pearl necklace are yet possessed of pearl necklaces, i.e., are yet charming.</p>
<p>Here, the apparent contradiction is to be explained by taking the word <strong>हारिणौ</strong>in the sense of &lsquo;charming&rsquo; only.</p>
<p><strong>XXXIV. विभावना</strong>— Peculiar Causation.</p>
<p>DEF.<strong>विभावना विनापि स्यात्कारणं कार्यजन्म चेत्।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>अपि लाक्षारसासिक्तंरक्तं त्वच्चरणद्वयम्॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. When the production of an effect is represented as being without cause, it is Peculiar Causation.</p>
<p>Ex. Lady! thy two feet are red though they were not dyed with red lac.</p>
<p>Here, the contradiction in the red feet without its cause, the lac, is due to the redness of the lady&rsquo;s feet being natural. Therefore, we see that the pro-</p>
<p>__________________________________________________________</p>
<p>*i.e., the incongruity is to be removed by explaining the words without the pun.</p>
<p>duction of an effect in the absence of its cause is not inconsistent in as much as the denial of a known cause suggests that the effect produced must be natural or is due to some other hidden cause.</p>
<p>A second kind of Peculiar Causation.</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>हेतूनामसमग्रत्वे कार्योत्पत्तिश्च सा मता।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>अस्त्रैरतीक्ष्णकठिनैर्जगज्जयति मन्मथः॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. When the production of an effect is represented as having taken place while its causes are apparently incomplete, (to produce such an effect), then it is the second kind of Peculiar Causation.</p>
<p>Ex. By weapons, neither sharp nor hard, the God of love conquers the whole world.</p>
<p>Here, the conquest of the world by the God of love is represented as having taken place though his weapons are neither sharp nor hard (being only <em>five flowers</em>) and are therefore quite inadequate to produce such an effect. The contradiction here must be removed by the supposition of some superhuman cause specially gifted by the Supreme Spirit.</p>
<p>A third kind of Peculiar Causation.</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>कार्योत्पत्तिस्तृतीया सा सत्यपि प्रतिबंधके।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>नरेंद्रानेव ते राजन् दशत्यसिभुजंगमः॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. When the production of an effect is said to have taken place though there was an impediment (to such an effect), it is the third kind of Peculiar Causation.</p>
<p>Ex. O king! thy sword-serpent bites only *Narendrān,*i.e., curers of poisons only (lit. kings).</p>
<p><strong>नरेन्द्र</strong>=king=dealer in antidotes. Here, serpent biting the curers of poison implies an impediment to the effect.</p>
<p>Fourth kind of Peculiar Causation.</p>
<p>DER. <strong>अकारणात्कार्यजन्म चतुर्थी स्याद्विभावना।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>शंखाद्वीणानिनादोऽयमुदेति महदद्भुतम्॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. When the production of an effect is represented as being from a different cause, or, more literally, from a similar cause, it is the fourth kind of Peculiar Causation.</p>
<p>Ex. It is a great wonder that this musical sound of a lute proceeds from a conch-shell (i.e., conch-shell-like neck of a damsel).</p>
<p>We know that a conch-shell cannot produce the sound of a lute and therefore this is a Peculiar Causation.</p>
<p><em>N.B.</em>— We have a Metaphorical Hyporbole in <strong>शंख</strong>, the upamāna, because it was used for its upameya, the neck of a damsel.</p>
<p><em>Fifth kind of Peculiar Causation.</em></p>
<p>DEF.<strong>विरुद्धात्कार्यसंपत्तिर्दृष्टा काचिद्विभावना।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>शीतांशुकिरणास्तन्वीं हंत संतापयन्ति ताम्॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. When the production of an effect is produced from an incongruous cause, i.e., from a cause quite opposite to the real one, it is the fifth kind of Peculiar Causation.</p>
<p>Ex. Alas! the rays of the moon (lit. cool-rayed) inflame that slender lady.</p>
<p>This is the state of a damsel, the object on hand, pining under separation from her lover. The rays of the moon have a peculiar charm of exciting the passions of such women and therefore it is said so.</p>
<p>Sixth kind of Peculiar Causation.</p>
<p>DEE. <strong>कार्यात्कारणजन्मापि दृष्टा काचिद्विभावना।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>यशः पयोराशिरभूत्करकल्पतरोस्तव॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. When the cause is said to have been produced from its effect, it is also termed Peculiar Causation.</p>
<p>Ex. O king! An ocean of fame has been formed out of thy hand-kalpataru (wish-yielding tree in the form of thy hand).</p>
<p>Here, the king referred to is Karṇa renowned for his liberal donations.</p>
<p>The kalpa tree was produced from the ocean at the time of churning. Here, the kalpa tree in the form of the king&rsquo;s hand is said to be the cause of the ocean in the form of the king&rsquo;s fame for his unusual liberality.</p>
<p><strong>XXXV. विशेषोक्तिः—</strong> Peculiar Allegation.</p>
<p>DEF. <strong>कार्याजनिर्विशेषोक्तिः सति पुष्कलकारणे।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>हृदि स्नेहक्षयो नाभूत्स्मरदीपे ज्वलत्यपि।</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. The non-production of an effect when there existed abundant cause (for the same) is called Peculiar Allegation.</p>
<p>Ex. The diminution of oil (lit. affection) did not take place in the heart (of this lady pining under separation) even though the cupid-lamp is burning(there).</p>
<p>Here, the burning of the cupid-lamp, the cause, is present and yet the effect, the diminution of oil, is represented as not taking place. The contradiction can, however, be removed by explaining the word <strong>स्नेह</strong> in the sense of &lsquo;affection&rsquo; only.</p>
<p><strong>XXXVI. असंभवः</strong>—Improbability.</p>
<p>DEF.<strong>असंभवोऽर्थनिष्पत्तेरसंभाव्यत्ववर्णनम्।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>को वेद गोपशिशुकःशैलमुत्पाटयेदिति॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. Improbability is the description of the accomplishment of a truly impossible act.</p>
<p>Ex. Who knew that this shepherd boy would have eradicated the Mountain Govardhana.</p>
<p>The shepherd boy is the Lord Kṛishṇa who held up the Mountain Govardhana for seven days as a large umbrella to shelter his beloved Gopīs and their cattle from the heavy and incessent rain caused by Indra to deluge the Gokūla, the land of the shepherds.</p>
<p><strong>XXXVII. असंगतिः</strong>— Disconnection.</p>
<p>DEE. <strong>विरुद्धं भिन्नदेशत्वं कार्यहेत्वोरसंगतिः।</strong></p>
<p>Ex. <strong>विषं जलधरैः पीतं मूर्च्छिताः पथिकांगनाः॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. The description of the effect and the cause as inconsistent and as occupying different locations, is termed Disconnection.</p>
<p>Ex. The poison (lit. water) was drunk by the clouds and the consorts of the travellers fainted.</p>
<p>This figure is only an exception to the ornament of Contradiction (<strong>XXXIII</strong>) and not Contradiction itself, where the mutual inconsistency of two objects resides in one place ; but in this figure in two different places. The drinking of poison (water) by the clouds and its effect, the fainting of the consorts, take place in two different localities. It is a convention of poets that the women are affected at the sight of the clouds in the rainy season being separated from their lovers who therefore hasten to meet their beloved.</p>
<p>Second and third kinds of Disconnection.</p>
<p>DEF. 2nd <strong>अन्यत्रकरणीयस्य ततोऽन्यत्र कृतिश्च सा।</strong></p>
<p>DEF. 3rd <strong>अन्यत्कर्तुं प्रवृत्तस्य तद्विरुद्धकृतिस्तथा॥</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. When the accomplishment or effect of an object to be produced in a certain locality is represented as having taken place in a quite different locality, it is called the second kind of Disconnection.</p>
<p>Def. An incongruous effect of an object obtained by an agent engaged to do a quite different thing is termed a third kind of Disconnection.</p>
<p>Example of the second kind of Disconnection.</p>
<p>अपारिजातां वसुधां चिकीर्षन् द्यां तथाऽकृथाः।</p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Lord Kṛishṇa who wished to make the earth Apārijātā devoid of the multitude of foes† made the celestial world so ie <strong>अपारिजाता</strong> devoid of Pārijātatree.</p>
<p>Pārijāta is a celestial tree produced at the churning of the milky-ocean. Kṛishṇa at the request of one of his wives Satyabhāmā carried off this tree from Indra&rsquo;s garden (Nandana). A conflict ensued between Indra and Kṛishṇain which the latter was victorious. The tree was brought to the city Dvārakā and was planted in the Satyabhāmā&rsquo;s pleasure-garden.</p>

<p>O Lord Vishṇu! formerly though thou wert engaged in the raising of the earth, thou didst (the opposite, i.e.) the splitting of the earth (by the foot-prints of the Varāha).</p>

<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. Vishama is a figure where a combination of two incongruous things is described.</p>
<p>Ex. Where this lady with body as soft as the Sirīsha flower and where these torments or fever of the God of love.</p>
<p>Here, we see the incongruity or incompatible relation of two things which are opposed to each other, i.e., the nature of the God of love is quite opposed to the nature of the lady, under description, whose body is soft as the Sirīsha flower.</p>
<p>Second kind of Incongruity.</p>

<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Def. The production of an effect from an incongruous cause is considered a second kind of Incongruity. Or in other words, when the quality of the effect is opposed to that of its cause, it is Incongruity.</p>
<p>Ex. O king! Thy dark sword produces a white fame.</p>
<p>Here, we have white fame arising from the dark sword which has been figured here as the cause in contravention to the general convention— that the quality of an effect must conform to its cause.</p>
<p>Third kind of Incongruity.</p>

Or in other words, when a desired object for which an endeavour is made is not obtained but, on the contrary, an unfavourable result is obtained, it is the third kind of Incongruity.</p>
<p>Ex. The rat seeing the snake-basket (entered into the same) in the hope of obtaining some eatables and was itself devoured by it (snake).</p>
<p>Here, the object of the rat to obtain some eatables for it by boring the basket was not attained and it became a pray to the hungry snake lying in the basket.</p>

<p>Def. A combination of the figures, <strong>दीपकम्</strong> (Illuminator XV) and <strong>एकावली</strong> (Necklace XLII), is called the Serial Illuminator. Or, in other words, the Serial Illuminator is that wherein a number of different objects is successively associated with one and the same attribute.</p>
<p>Ex. Cupid set <em>his</em> foot in the heart of that lady, and by it, <em>i.e.,</em> the heart of the lady, in thee.</p>
<p>This is addressed to a lover by a go-between sent by her mistress pining under separation.</p>
<p>Here, the one and the same attribute <strong>स्थितिः कृता</strong> being associated with two objects <strong>प्रकृत</strong> and <strong>अप्रकृत,</strong> it is the Illuminator ; and by <strong>ग्रहीतमुक्तरीत्या</strong> of the lady&rsquo;s heart, it is the Necklace (see the preceding figure). Thus, we have a blending of the two.</p>

<p>The lady longed for her lover and was about to go to meet him; and this was easily accomplished by the accidental operation of another cause—the setting of the sun, which enabled the lady to set out freely under the protecting mantle of the dark.</p>

<p>Def. The accomplishment of an act founded upon the popular maxim <strong>कैमुतिकन्यायः</strong>&lsquo;argument with stronger reason&rsquo;, is termed the Necessary Conclusion.</p>
<p>** कैमुत्य** is the abstract noun of <strong>किमुत</strong> &lsquo;how much more&rsquo;. <strong>कैमुतिकन्यायः</strong> is usually called <strong>दण्डापूपन्यायः</strong>the maxim of the stick and the cakes. When a stick and some cakes are tied together and, when the stick has been eaten away by a rat, we are naturally led to believe that the cakes also have been eaten by the rat, the two things being so closely connected. Thus, when we say something of the one of two such things, the same naturally applies to the other thing also.</p>
<p>Ex. (Lady!) That moon has been conquered by thy face. What necessity is there to speak of (or why we speak of) lotuses.</p>
<p>It is an acknowledged fact that lotuses begin to shrink and become faded on the rise of the moon. When that moon, the subduer of the lotuses, has been conquered, the fact that lotuses too have been conquered much more becomes a necessary conclusion.</p>

<p>Def. If the words that serve to signify the sense on hand intimate also theobject to be hinted at,then it is called the Sealing.</p>
<p>Ex. This maiden has large buttocks and a couple of spacious eyes.</p>
<p>Here,<strong>युग्मविपुला</strong>serves to signify the sense required for the description of the lady the subject on hand. The same word is also the name of a metre of <strong>अनुष्टुम्</strong> class containing 8 syllables for each quarter wherein the seventh syllable of the 2nd and 4th quarters must be short. Thus, we see that the same word that served the purpose on hand—the description of the lady— also names the metre of the verse to be hinted at by the poet, the stanza being the illustration of that metre.</p>
<p>It is usual <em>among</em> the Sanskrit prosodians to illustrate a metre, defined, by a stanza containing the name of that metre which will also serve to explain the sense contained in the stanza. Hence the figure is called** मुद्रा—** an expression of things by their right names.</p>

<p>The difference between this figure and the figure <strong>मुद्रा</strong> (LXXIII) is that in this figure the sense of the words referring to objects not on hand—<em>i.e.</em> the sense to be hinted at—also serves to explain the sentence in another way under a pun, but it is not so in the Mudrā.</p>

Borrower.</p>
<p>Ex. O Lover! though seated long in my red (affectionate) mind, yet thou dost not become red<br>

<p>The strikingness of this example rests upon the use of the word<strong>राग</strong> which means both redness and affection.</p>
<p>Here, the lover does not become red (affectionate) though he is seated in the red (more affectionate) mind of the lady. Hence it is the Non-Borrower.</p>

<p><em>Poetical Conventions.</em></p>
<p>The student should know first some of the conventions of poets to understand this as well as other works better.</p>
<p>The sky, sin, sorrow, sea, clouds, serpents, infamy, etc., are described as black; fame, laughter, renown,‌virtue, umbrella, water, flower, cloth, etc., as white; anger, love, sun, learning, etc., as red; valour as red‌ and hot. Lotuses, lilies, etc., can be described as growing in all the rivers, seas and in small tanks. Flamingoes and other birds are said to haunt in all‌ receptacles of water. Water-elephants live in celestial Ganges too. Gems and the fish &lsquo;makara&rsquo; are found in oceans; pearls in the river Tāmraparṇī only. Bhūrja trees grow in the Himālaya alone; Sandal trees grow only in the Malaya Mountain and bear no flowers and fruits. Asoka does not‌ fructify. Lotuses bloom only in the day; lilies only in the night. Mālatī does not bloom in the spring. The Indian cuckoos utter sweet notes only in the spring season. The cries and dances of peacocks and the emigration of the flamingoes to the Mānasa Lake occur only in the rainy season. The chakora</p>
<p>birds are said to drink the moonlight. chakravāka birds always move in couple; and the couple occupying the opposite banks of a river never see each other during the whole night. The God‌ of love bears a flowery bow with only five flowery shafts and his bow-string is strung with bees. There is moonlight throughout the bright fortnight; and darkness throughout the black fortnight. The description of the setting sun must be followed by that of the rising moon. Separated lovers are affected at the sight of the clouds and feel the moonlight and the Malaya breeze as fire and also suffer very much from love fever. The moon on the crest of God Siva is always described as young. The description of men must be from head to foot and, in case of Gods, from foot to head.</p>
<p>**1.उपमा —**Simile.</p>
<p>Words expressive of comparison.</p>
<p>इव वद्‌ वा यथा (शब्दाः) समान-निभ-सन्निभाः।<br>

सवर्ण-तुलितौ (शब्दै ये चान्यूनार्थवादिनः)॥</p>
<p>D. K.</p>
<p>Of these, <strong>वत्, कल्प, देश्य, देशीय</strong> are taddhita terminations. The last three express a slight incomplete comparison. See V. 3. 67 P. A.</p>
<p><em>Other terminations expressive of comparison.</em></p>
<p>** क्यच् (य)** <em>a denominative termination—Parasmaipada.</em></p>
<p>** उपमानादाचारे** (III. 1. 10). The affix <strong>क्यच्</strong> is optionally employed, in the sense of treatment, after a word ending in a case-affix denoting the object of comparison. Thus, <strong>पुत्रमिवाचरति</strong> <strong>छात्रम्</strong> <strong>=</strong> <strong>पुत्रीयति</strong> <strong>छात्रम्</strong>=he treats the pupil as a son P. A.</p>
<p>** क्यङ् (य)** <em>denominative termination-Ātmanepada</em>.</p>
<p>** कर्तुः क्यङ् सलोपश्च** (III. 1. 11). The affix <strong>क्यङ्</strong> is optionally employed in the sense of behaving, after a word ending in a case-affix denoting the object of comparison of the agent and there is elision of the final <strong>स्</strong> of the noun if it ends with a <strong>स्</strong>. Thus, <strong>श्येना इव आचरति काकः = श्येनायते काकः</strong> = the crow behaves like a hawk. <strong>P. A.</strong></p>
<p>** क्विप्**(nil) <em>a krit termination which is usually omitted.</em></p>
<p>The affix <strong>क्विप्</strong> comes optionally in the sense of behaving like some one after all crude nouns (Vārtika of III. I. 11). Thus, <strong>गर्दभति</strong> or <strong>गर्दभायते =</strong> he behaves like an ass or he asses. <strong>P. A.</strong></p>
<p><strong>कन्</strong> <em>a taddhitātermination.</em></p>
<p>** लुम्मनुष्ये** (V. 3. 98). When a man is denoted, the affix <strong>कन्</strong> expressing comparison is elided, the word</p>
<p>retaining its number and gender. Thus <strong>चञ्चा (चञ्चा इव पुरुषः)</strong> a straw-man, <em>i.e.,</em> an effigy in straw. <strong>P. A.</strong></p>
<p><strong>णिनि (णिन्)</strong> * a krit termination.*</p>
<p>** कर्तर्युपमाने** (III. 2. 79). The affix <strong>णिनि</strong> comes after a verb when it is in composition with a word denoting an object of comparison, expressing the agent, the sense of the affix being &lsquo;doing something like that&rsquo;.

<p><strong>णमुल्</strong> <em>the gerundial affix in</em> <strong>अम्</strong>.</p>
<p>** उपमाने कर्मणि च** (III. 4. 45 ). The affix <strong>णमुल्</strong> comes after a root, when an object or an agent, denoting similitude, is in composition with it. Thus, **घृतनिधायं निहितं जलम् =‘**water was kept as ghee was kept&rsquo;. <strong>P. A.</strong></p>

<p>After carefully studying the above, the student should try to understand the following 32 varieties of the Figure <strong>उपमा</strong> according to S. D., K. P. and R. S. Of the ornaments of sense, <strong>उपमा</strong> forms the essence of all the figures that are founded on similarity and therefore its complete study becomes essential.</p>
<ul>
<li>Observe*. <strong>उपमा</strong> is first two-fold <strong>पूर्णा</strong> &lsquo;complete&rsquo; and <strong>लुप्ता</strong> &rsquo;elliptical&rsquo;. These again are <strong>श्रौती</strong> <em>direct</em> when the comparison is expressed by the employment of such words as <strong>यथा, इव, वा</strong> or <strong>वत्</strong> all in the sense of English &lsquo;as&rsquo;; and <strong>आर्थी</strong> <em>indirect</em> when the comparison is</li>
</ul>
<p>expressed by the use of the words <strong>तुल्य, समान,</strong> etc., all in the sense of English &rsquo;like &lsquo;<strong>श्रौती</strong> conveys the notion of similarity at the very hearing <strong>आर्थी</strong> is to be understood only through the meaning ofthe expression. These two kinds are again three-fold as they occur in a sentence <strong>(वाक्यगता ),</strong> in a compound <strong>(समासगता)</strong> and in a nominal affix <strong>( तद्धितगता).</strong> Thus, there are 6 varieties of <strong>पूर्णा ;</strong> and but of <strong>लुप्ता,</strong> there are 26 varieties.</p>
<p><strong>पूर्णा –</strong> 6 varieties.</p>

<p>मलयानिलमनलीयति मणिभवने काननीयति क्षणतः।<br>

<p>R.G.</p>
<p>That lady devoid of heart through pining in separation feels the Malaya breeze as fire itself; herself, residing in a jewelled mansion, thinks in a moment as if she is in a desert; and she is troubled like a fish out of water.</p>
<p>Here, in <strong>अनलीयति = अनलमिवाचरति,</strong> we have <strong>अनलम्</strong> in the accusative case because the <strong>मलयानिलम्</strong>, the upameya, is also in the accusative case.<strong>*</strong> Hence it is <strong>कर्म-क्यच् .</strong> In <strong>काननीयति = कानने इव आचरति,</strong> we have<strong>कानन</strong> in the locative case and it is therfore <strong>आधार क्यच्.</strong> In <strong>निर्जलमीनायते - निर्जल - मीनवत् आचरति,</strong> we have <strong>क्यङ्.</strong></p>
<p>निरपायं सुधापायं पयस्तव पिबन्ति ये।<br>

<p><strong>R.G.</strong></p>
<p>** **O Jahnu&rsquo;s daughter ( Gangā ) ! Those people who drink thyharmless water resembling the nectar—they all live in like immortal beings.</p>
<p>Here, in <strong>सुधापायम् = सुधामिव पीत्वा,</strong> we have <strong>सुधा</strong> in the accusative case ; and hence it is <strong>कर्म- णमुल्</strong> of root <strong>पा</strong> &rsquo;to drink&rsquo;. In <strong>निर्जरावासम् - निर्जराः इव उषित्वा,</strong> we have <strong>निर्जराः</strong> in the nominative case like its upameya <strong>नराः</strong> and hence it is <strong>कर्तृ- णमुल्</strong> of root <strong>वस्</strong> &rsquo;to dwell&rsquo;.</p>

<p>In <strong>तिलोत्तमीयन्त्या = तिलोत्तमा<em>मिव</em> <em>आत्मानं</em> आचारन्त्या,</strong> we have the omission of the upameya <strong>आत्मानम्</strong> and of the word <strong>&lsquo;इव&rsquo;</strong> expressive of comparison. <strong>मृगशावकचक्षुषा= मृगशावकस्य <em>चक्षुषी</em> <em>इव</em> <em>चञ्चले</em> चक्षुषी यस्याः तया,</strong> we have the omission of the upamāna **&lsquo;चक्षुषी &lsquo;**of the word &lsquo;<strong>इव&rsquo;,</strong> expressing comparison and of the common attribute <strong>चञ्चले</strong>.</p>

<p>The meeting of that man with the robbers and the killing of that man by the robbers—each has occurred accidentally like the maxim of the crow and the palm fruit.</p>
<p>Here in <strong>काकतालम्</strong>, we have the omission of the upamāna ‘<strong>समागमः</strong>and the word <strong>&lsquo;इव&rsquo;</strong> expressing comparison in a compound. In <strong>काकतालीयम्</strong>, we have the omission of the upamāna <strong>&lsquo;मरण&rsquo;</strong> in a compound with <strong>छ-प्रत्यय</strong> which expresses comparison. See pages</p>

<p><strong>R.S</strong>.</p>
<p>All the forest has been explored and all the trees were seen; still O mango tree! thy likeness in the world was not obtained by this bee.</p>
<p>Here, there is the omission of the upamāna and of the common attribute in a sentence. If we remove the words <strong>&rsquo; तथापि ते समम्,</strong> and substitute <strong>भवत्समम्</strong>, we have the same in a compound.</p>

<p>Here, in <strong>क्षीरोदीयन्ति = क्षीरोदमिव आत्मानमाचरन्ति</strong>, we have the omission of the upameya <strong>&lsquo;आत्मानम्&rsquo;</strong> and of the common attribute &rsquo; <strong>शुक्लता</strong> = whiteness&rsquo;.</p>
<p>S. D. mentions two other varieties of <strong>उपमा</strong>, <em>viz.</em>, <strong>मालोपमा</strong> and <strong>रशनोपमा</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>मालोपमा –</strong> Garland of Similes.</p>
<p>Def. When one object is compared to many, or in‌ other words, when one upameya is compared to many upamānas, it is called <strong>मालोपमा</strong>.</p>

<p>The wicked people are expert in working obstacles to the wellbeing of the good. The serpents are clever in taking away the lives of the innocent,</p>

<p>Certainly, a good man without being urged (by any body) gladdens the whole world, not a little, by his agreeable behaviour. Propitiated by whom, tell me, does the moon cause the assemblages of blue lotuses to blow by his illustrious rays ?</p>
<p>**27. अप्रस्तुतप्रशंसा —**Indirect Description.</p>
<p>The principal feature of this figure is that the description of the <strong>अप्रस्तुत</strong>, <em>i.e.,</em> what is not the subject-matter, must convey a reference to the <strong>प्रस्तुत</strong> <em>i.e</em>., the subject-matter. S. D., K. P. and R. S., mention five varieties of this figure :—</p>
<p>कार्ये निमित्ते सामान्ये विशेष प्रस्तुते सति।<br>
तदन्यस्य वचस्तुल्ये तुल्यस्येति च पञ्चधा॥</p>
<p>** कार्ये प्रस्तुते सति =** when an effect is the subject-matter, <strong>तदन्यस्य वचः=</strong> the description of its contrary, ie., cause (<strong>कारण); निमित्ते प्रस्तुते सति =</strong> when a cause is the subject-matter, <strong>तदन्यस्य वचः</strong> the description of its contrary, i.e., the effect <strong>(कार्य); सामान्धे प्रस्तुते सति =</strong> when a general is the subject matter, <strong>तदन्यस्य वचः</strong> the description of its contrary, i.e., the particular <strong>(विशेष); विशेष प्रस्तुते सति =</strong> when a particular is the subject matter, <strong>तदन्यस्य वचः =</strong> the description of its contrary, i.e., the general <strong>(सामान्य); तुल्ये प्रस्तुते सति</strong> when a similar thing is the subject matter, <strong>तुल्यस्य वचः =</strong> the description of another similar thing; <strong>इति =</strong> in this manner, <strong>पञ्चधा</strong> five-fold.</p>
<p>When the subject-matters in hand are (1) an effect (2) a cause, (3) a general, (4) a particular, the descriptions of their contraries, <em>i.e</em>., cause, effect, particular, general, respectively and when (5) a similar thing is the subject-matter, the description of another similar thing, (or in other words, when the descriptions of (1) a cause, (2) an effect, (3) particular, (4) a general, and (5) a similar thing convey reference to (1) effect, (2) cause, (3) the general, (4) the particular and (5) another similar thing which are respectively in question, such descriptions) are called the five varieties of this figure.</p>
<p>Examples in their order.</p>
<p>(1) Effect is understood from the description of a cause.</p>
<p>आनम्य वल्गुणुवचनैर्विनिवारितऽपि<br>
रोषात्प्रयातुमुदिते मयि दूरदेशम्।<br>
बाला कराङ्गुलिनिदेशवशंवदेन<br>
क्रीड़ाबिड़ालशिशुनाशु रुरोध मार्गम्॥</p>
<p>R. S.</p>
<p>When I began to start, through anger, for a distant countrythough I was obstructed, by sweet words, (by my lady) bending onh er knees, that young maiden immediately arrested my way by her sportive kitten acting obedient to her will pointed out by her fingers.</p>
<p>Here, the cause, the lady&rsquo;s act, is described, when the effect, the prevention of her lover&rsquo;s departure is to be understood.</p>
<p>(2) Cause is understood from the description of an effect.</p>
<p>इन्दुर्लिप्त इवाञ्चनेन जड़िता दृष्टिर्मुगीणामिव<br>
प्रम्लानारुणिमेव विद्रुमदलं श्यामेव हेमप्रभा।<br>
कार्कश्यं कलया च कोकिलवधूकण्ठेष्विव प्रस्तुतं<br>
सीतायाः पुरतश्च हन्त शिखिनां वर्हाः सगर्हा इव॥</p>
<p>S. D.</p>
<p>Alas! In the presence of Sītā, the moon looked as if besmeared with lamp-black, the eyes of the does appeared to practice stupefaction, the <em>vidruma</em> leaf seemed to have attained faded redness, the lustre of the gold became black, harshness seemed to have resided in the throats of the female cuckoos when they uttered sweet notes, and the tails of the peacocks deserved consure.</p>
<p>Here, from the supposed effects of the moon being besmeared with the lamp-black etc., their causes, the extraordinary beauty of the face etc. of Sītā, are understood.</p>
<p>(3) The particular is understood from the description of a general.</p>
<p>कृतमपि महोपकारं पय इव पीत्वा निरातङ्गः।<br>
प्रत्युत हन्तुं यतते काकोदरसोदरः खलो जगति॥</p>
<p>R. S.</p>
<p>In this world a wicked man, the type of a serpent, swallowing up even the great favour done (to him) like milk fearlessly tries on the contrary to kill (his benefactor).</p>
<p>Here, the description of a wicked man in general conveys a reference to a particular person, before the speaker, the subject matter,</p>
<p>(4) A general is understood from the description of the particular.</p>
<p><strong>हारं वक्षसि केनापि दत्तमज्ञेन मर्कटः।<br>
लेढ़ि जिघ्रति संक्षिप्य करोत्युन्नतमासनम्॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>R. S.</strong></p>
<p>The monkey, on whose bosom a necklace was placed by some ignorant fellow, licks and smells it (necklace) and compressing the same makes it to serve as a high seat (for himself).</p>
<p>Here, the description of the particular which is not the subject matter refers to a general statement that ignorant persons should not be placed in possession of charming and valuable things which they do not deserve. Compare the proverb. &ldquo;To throw pearls before swine&rdquo;.</p>
<p>(5) A similar thing is understood from the description of another, similar to it—</p>
<p>जनकः सानुविशेषो जातिः काष्ट भुजङ्गमैः सङ्गः।<br>
स्वगुणैरेव पटीरज ! यातोऽसि तथापि महिमानम्॥</p>
<p>Bhāminīvilāsa.</p>
<p>O Sandal tree! Thy father (native place) is a particular mountain (Malaya); thy creed is wood; and thy association is with the serpents; still thou hast attained to the greatness by thy own good qualities.</p>
<p>Here, the description of the sandal tree conveys a reference to a similar object, a good person born of a low caste and living amidst villains.</p>
<p>45. **व्याघातः—**Frustration.</p>
<p>S. D. defines this figure thus:—&lsquo;Frustration is when by the same means that one employed in bringing a thing to a particular state, another brings it to</p>
<p>an opposite one&rsquo; —and quotes the following as an example</p>
<p>दृशा दग्धं मनसिजं जीवयन्ति दृशैव याः।<br>
विरूपाक्षस्य जयिनीस्ताः स्तुमो वामलोचनाः॥</p>
<p>We eulogize the fair-eyed women, the conquerors of God Śiva of uneven (lit. deformed) eyes in that they (women) with their eyes restore to life the God of Love who was burnt by the eye (of God Śiva).</p>
<p>**53. परिसंख्या—**Special Mention.</p>
<p>S. D. defines this figure thus:—</p>
<p>&rsquo; When with, or without a query, something is affirmed for the denial, expresssed or understood, of something else similar to it, it is Special Mention.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ex.</p>
<p>किं भूषणं सुदृढ़मत्र यशो न रत्नं<br>
किं कार्यमार्यचरितं सुकृतं न दोषः।<br>
किं च‌क्षुरप्रतिहतं धिषणा न नेत्रम्<br>
जानाति कस्त्वदपरः सदसद्विवेकम्॥</p>
<p>What is an imperishable (lit. very firm) ornament here (in this world) ?—fame, not a gem. What ought to be performed?— a good deed practised by the venerable men, and not a crime. Which is called an unimpeded eye?— the intellect, not the eye (itself). Who else than thee (O king!) knows the discrimination between good and evil.</p>
<p>Here, a gem etc., which are to be denied as an ornament etc., are expressed, each preceded by a query.</p>
<p>किमाराध्यं सदा पुण्यं कश्च सेव्यः सदागमः।<br>
को ध्येयो भगवान् विष्णुः किं काम्यं परमं पदम्॥</p>
<p>What is ever to be practised—virtue.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> What is to be resorted to— the study of good science. Who is to be meditated upon the God Vishnu. Which is to be desired the abode of Vishnu or final beatitude.</p>
<p>Here, sin etc., which are to be denied, are under stood, here also preceded by a query.</p>
<p>Without queries:—</p>
<p>भक्तिर्भवे न विभवे व्यसनं शास्त्रे न युवतिकामास्त्रे।<br>
चिन्ता यशसि न वपुषि प्रायः परिदृश्यते महताम्॥</p>
<p>Devotion to God Śiva and not to riches, intent attachment to the science and not to young maiden, the weapon of God of Love; anxiety for fame and not for body are generally found in the great.</p>
<p>Here, things to be denied are expressed.</p>
<p>बलमार्त्तभयोपशान्तये विदुषां सम्मतये बहुश्रुतम्।<br>
वसु तस्य न केवलं विभोर्गुणवत्तांऽपि परप्रयोजनम्।</p>
<p>The strength of that lord is for quelling the fear of the distressed. His great learning is for honouring the scholars. Not only his riches but his possession of good qualities too are for the purpose of others.</p>
<p>This figure founded upon a Paronomasia is more striking. <em>For example see the text.</em></p>
<p>58. **प्रत्यनीकम् —**Rivalry.</p>
<p>Ex</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>मध्येन तनुमध्या मे मध्यं जितवतीत्ययम्।<br>
इभकुम्भौ भिनत्त्यास्याः कुचकुम्भनिभौ हरिः॥</p>
<p>This slender-waisted maiden vanquished my waist with hers&rsquo;—so thinking, the lion cleaves the frontal globes (on the forehead) of the elephant which resemble the jar-like bosoms of that lady.</p>
<p>Here, the lion unable to avenge itself directly on the lady, its conqueror in vanquishing its waist by hers, cleaves the frontal globes, of the elephant, which have a connection of resemblance with the circular bosoms of the lady. This kind of description proves the excellence of the waist of the lady.</p>
<p>60. **काव्यलिङ्गम् —**Poetical Reason.</p>
<p>Def. When a reason is implied in a sentence or in a word or words, it is called Poetical Reason.</p>
<p>Ex</p>

<p>O God Śiva (lit. Destroyer of 3 cities)! By this (my) body coming into existance, it must be inferred that I never saluted thee in any of my previous births. And now saluting thee, I am emancipated; and I therefore, bodiless, cannot salute thee in my future birth. Thus these two faults of mine should be pardoned O Great Lord</p>
<p>Here, non-salutation becomes the reason for the faults committed and this fact is expressed by two sentences.</p>
<p>** अतनुः—**&rsquo;non-assumption of the body&rsquo; is the reason for <strong>अग्रे अनतिभाक्</strong> &rsquo;non-salutation in the future birth&rsquo; and we have <strong>काव्यलिंग</strong> in a single word. <strong>नमन्मुक्तः</strong> &lsquo;final emancipation by saluting&rsquo; is the reason for <strong>अतनुः</strong> &rsquo;non-assumption of the body and this fact having been expressed by two words <strong>नमन्मुक्तः,</strong> we have the Poetical Reason in more than one word.</p>
<ul>
<li>N.B.—<em>This figure occuring in a sentence should not be confounded with the figures <strong>अर्थान्तरन्यास</strong> &lsquo;Tran- sition&rsquo; (59) nor with <strong>अनुमानम्</strong> &lsquo;Inference&rsquo;;<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> * on this, S. D. says as follows:</em><strong>—</strong>* In the province of poetry the reason is three-fold, as being Informative, Completive and Justificative (or Confirmative). Of these three sorts, the Infirmative Reason is the subject of the figure Inference, the Completive of the Poetical Reason and the Justificative of the Transition. Thus the Transition founded upon a causation is evidently distinct from the Poetical Reason.&rsquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>S. D. defines it thus:—The notion, expressed in a peculiarly striking manner, of a thing established by proof, is termed Inference,&rsquo; and exemplifies thus:—</p>
<p>यत्र पतत्यबलानां दृष्टिर्निशिताः पतन्ति तत्र शराः।<br>
तच्चापारोपितशरी धावत्यासां पुरः स्मरो मन्ये॥</p>
<p>‘Wherever falls the sight of women, there fall sharpened arrows; Hence, I infer, Cupid runs before them with his bow furnished with shafts.’</p>
<p>**92. वक्रोक्तिः—**Crooked Speech.</p>
<p>** काकु** &lsquo;Emphasis&rsquo; is an emotional alteration of the sound or an affected change of voice in such a manner as to imply the contrary meaning of the expression employed by the speaker.</p>
<p>Ex.</p>
<p>असमालोच्य कोपस्ते नोचितोऽयमितीरिता।<br>
नैवोचितोऽयमिति तं ताड़यामास मालया॥</p>
<p>‘Lady! Thy anger is an inconsiderate one and is not just;’thus told (by her lover), she saying (in a prolated and affected tone) &lsquo;NOT just&rsquo; gave him a blow with her garland.</p>
<p>**95. उदात्तम्—**The Exalted.</p>
<p>Example of the description of prosperity.</p>
<p>रत्नस्तम्भेषु संक्रान्तैः प्रतिबिम्बशतैर्वृतः।<br>
ज्ञातो लंकेश्वरः कृछ्रादाञ्जनेयेन तत्वतः॥</p>
<p>Rāvaņa surrounded by the innumerable images of his own reflected in the jewelled pillars (of his palace) was with great difficulty recognized by Hanümän (lit. son of <strong>अञ्जना</strong>).</p>
<p>From this, the super-mundane prosperity of Rāvana, king of Lankā, the object under description, is apprehended.</p>
<p>It is essentially necessary that student should know what is <strong>संसृष्टिः</strong> &lsquo;Conjunction&rsquo; and what is <strong>संकरः</strong> &lsquo;Commixture&rsquo; as they are not treated in this book.</p>
<p>Def. A combination of two or more of the ornaments treated in this book which exist independently of each other in one place is called the Conjunction <strong>संसृष्टि</strong>. On the contrary, a combination of two or more ornaments, in one and the same place, which are subordinate to one another and about which there is dubiousness is called the Commixture <strong>सङ्कर</strong>.</p>
<p>Example of Conjunction.</p>
<p>देवः पायादपायान्नः स्मेरेन्दीवरलोचनः।<br>
संसारध्वान्तविध्वंसहंसः कंसनिसूदनः॥</p>
<p>May that God (Krishna) of the blooming lotus-like eyes the Slayer of Kamsa the Sun in annihilating the darkness of this worldly life protect us from calamity. (<strong>हंस</strong> = Sun).</p>
<p>In the compound <strong>स्मेरे०</strong>, we have an Elliptical Simile No. 1 in the omission of the word implying comparison; and in the compound <strong>संसा०</strong>, we have a Metaphor by the superimposition of the God Sun upon Krishna. These two ornaments exist in the same place independently of each other.</p>
<p>Example of Commixture.</p>
<p>इदमाभाति गगने भिन्दानं सन्ततं तमः।<br>
अमन्दनयनानन्दकरं मण्डलमैन्दवम्॥</p>
<p>This lunar orb dispelling the thick darkness and causing excessive delight to the eyes shines in the sky.</p>
<p>This can be taken as:—</p>
<p>(1) <strong>अप्रस्तुतप्रशंसा—</strong></p>
<p>Indirect Description, as this description of the resplendent moon shining in the sky—</p>
<p>the object not on hand—</p>
<p>conveys a reference</p>
<p>to a beautiful dame standing on the top of a skykissing mansion, her circular face alone being visible above the parapet wall;</p>
<p><strong>(2)</strong> A Metaphor No. 1 <strong>अनुभयाभेदरूपकम्</strong> as the moon&rsquo;s orb is superimposed upon a fair face intimated by the pronoun &lsquo;<strong>इदम्</strong> = this&rsquo;;</p>
<p><strong>(3) अतिशयोक्ति</strong> No.1 <strong>(रूपकातिश्योक्ति</strong> = Metaphorical Hyperbole), through the introsusception of the circular face in the orb of the moon;</p>
<p>** (4) पर्यायोक्तम्—<strong>Periphrasis, as the advent of the night that excites delight in the minds of the united lovers the fact to be intimated by the speaker</strong>—<strong>has been expressed by a turn of speech</strong>—**the description of the moon;</p>
<p>**(5) समासोक्ति —**Modal Metaphor, as the face inti- mated by &lsquo;<strong>इदम्</strong> —this&rsquo; **—**the object not on hand, is understood by the description of the moon—the object on hand, from a sameness of action, i.e., the action of expelling the darkness of the night by their splen- dours;</p>
<p>**(6) तुल्ययोगिता —<strong>Equal Pairing, as the face and the lunar orb which can be taken as objects on hand are associated with a sameness of attributes</strong>—**shining and expelling the darkness;</p>
<p>** (7) दीपकम् —**Illuminator, as the face and the lunar orb the former of which is now taken as the object on hand and the latter as one not on hand are together associated with one and the same attribute—the verb <strong>आभाति</strong>; and so on.</p>
<p>As we have here a dubiousness about all these ornaments, this figure is called <strong>सङ्कर</strong>।</p>

12</p>
<p>In <strong>UPAMA</strong>, we have a striking expressed resemblance that has been sanctioned by convention of poets and that will exite poetical delight and give an‌ agreeable surprise. In <strong>PRATIPA</strong>, we have not got that striking resemblance. The usual form of comparison is inverted and the excellence of <em>upameya</em> over <em>upamāna</em> is implied. In <strong>UTPREKSHA</strong>, we have a more stricking suggested resemblance not confined to the‌ convention of poets but solely due to the imaginative skill of the poet.</p>

<p>In <strong>UPAMA</strong>, the comparison is between two distinct objects&ndash;<em>upameya</em> and <em>upamāna</em>. In <strong>ANANVAYA</strong>, one and the same object is compared, i.e., to itself in the absence of a second thing to be compared to. The resemblance is not a striking one.</p>

<p>In <strong>UPAMA</strong>, we have the comparison in one sentence. In the other, we have the reciprocal comparison between two distinct objects and the reciprocation is possible only in two sentences. The comparision is not a striking one.</p>

<p>In <strong>UPAMA</strong>, the comparison is not accompanied with a difference. In <strong>VYATIREKA</strong>, the difference is also stated, i.e., comparison is stated in one respect and denied in another respect.</p>

(13)</p>
<p>In <strong>RUPAKA</strong>, two distinct objects―upamāna and upameya―are represented as identical on account of their close resemblance. In <strong>ATISAYOKTI</strong> No. 1, upameya is comprehended as identical with upamāna through introsusception and is expressed by the word representing the upamāna.</p>
<p>रूपक<br>
5<br>
and<br>
अपह्नुति<br>
11</p>
<p>In <strong>RUPAKA</strong>, upamāna and upameya are identified without their distinct characters being concealed. In <strong>APAHNUTI</strong> the real character of the <em>upameya</em> is concealed, i.e., denied and that of another imaginary upamāna is superimposed upon it.</p>
<p>रूपक<br>

<p>In <strong>RUPAKA</strong>, the identification is not a mistaken one. In <strong>BHRANTIMAN</strong>, it is mistaken one.</p>

<p>In <strong>PARINAMA</strong>, the act of the sentient <em>upameya</em> is transferred to the upamāna. In <strong>RUPAKA</strong>, the upamāna is not connected with any act of the upameya.</p>

<p>In <strong>ULLEKHA</strong>, the upameya isl ooked upon as identical with severlupamānas by one or different perceiverst hrough difference of peculiarities according to their taste. In <strong>RUPAKA</strong>,</p>
<p>the upameya is simply identified with one or many upamānas on account of their close resemblance only and not under any differential peculiarity.</p>

संन्देह<br>
10</p>
<p>In <strong>SMRITIMAN</strong>, the sight of the upamāna brings to the mind of the beholder the recollection of the upameya. In <strong>BHRANTIMAN</strong>, we mistake upameya for upamāna. In <strong>SANDEHA</strong>, we doubt the certainty of an object—whether it is upamāna or upameya.</p>

In <strong>APAHNUTI</strong>, the upameya is denied, i.e., is concealed and some other, i.e., upamāna is imposed upon it. In <strong>VYAJOKTI</strong>, we have the artful concealment of an object, though discovered, which is not mentioned by the person who conceals the same. <strong>AKSHEPA</strong>, we have only a semblance of denial, i.e., a pretended denial of <em>what has been said</em> by the speaker himself.</p>

<p>In <strong>UTPREKSHA</strong>, the introsusception is not complete, <em>i.e.</em>, the upameya is fancied under the character of upamāna. In <strong>ATISAYOKTI</strong>, the introsusception is complete, as the upameya which is comprehended as upamāna is</p>
<p>not mentioned and is expressed by the word expressing the upamāna.</p>

<p>In <strong>UTPREKSHA</strong>, the poet who entertains the fancy is fully aware of the distinct nature of the upameya to which he attributes the imaginary character— upamāna. In <strong>BHRANTIMAN</strong>, the person who mistakes the upameya for upamāna is not conscious of the upameya—the subject mistaken, on account of its close resemblance with the upamāna.</p>

<p>In <strong>UTPREKSHA</strong>, the fancied upamāna is apprehended more prominently than the upameya. In <strong>SANDEHA</strong>, both upamāna and upameya are apprehended as equally prominent on account of their close resemblance which creates a doubt in the mind of the perceiver who is therefore unable to decide whether the object before him is really upameya or upamāna itself.</p>

<p>In <strong>TULYAYOGITA</strong>, we have the sameness of attribute of objects on hand, or of objects not on hand. In <strong>DIPAKA</strong>, the objects on hand and those not on hand are together associated with one and the same attribute mentioned only nonce. (See pages 46 and 47.)</p>

<p>In <strong>PRATIVASTUPAMA</strong>, we have a parallel representation of the same common attribute <em>expressed by different words</em>. In <strong>DRISHTANTA</strong>, we have a reflective <em>representation of similar attributes.</em> (See page 50.) In <strong>PRATIVASTUPAMA</strong>, the two sentences* employed terminate in conveying the same sense.In <strong>DRISHTANTA</strong>, the sentences * have a similar sense reflectively expressed. In <strong>NIDARSANA</strong>, the senses of two sentences†terminate in a comparison. In <strong>ARTHANTARANYASA</strong>, we have the relation of general and particular between the senses of two sentences employed one of which serves to illustrate the other.</p>

In <strong>VYATIREKA</strong>, we have an expressed resemblance accompanied by a difference. In <strong>MILITA</strong>, we have a suggested resemblance; but the difference between upameya and upamāna is not perceivable on account of the one having been eclipsed by the other, <em>i.e.,</em> the upameya, inferior in quality, is not at all apprehended by its being eclipsed by the upamāna, superior in quality. In <strong>SAMANYA</strong>, the two objects, upa-<br>
<strong>________________________________________________________________</strong></p>
<p>* Are independent of each other. † Are dependent upon each other.</p>
<p>māna and upameya, could not be distinguished on account of their having like properties and in the absence of any discriminating peculiarity. In <strong>MILITA</strong>, the inferior object gives up its own quality. In <strong>SAMANYA</strong>, both the objects do not give up their qualities. In <strong>UNMILITA</strong>, the difference which was not perceivable as in <strong>MILITA</strong>, becomes manifest by some act of the perceiver. In <strong>VISESHAKA</strong>, the discriminating peculiarity which was absent in <strong>SAMANYA</strong> becomes manifest by the accidental operation of another agency.</p>

<p>In <strong>SAMASOKTI</strong>, the object not on hand, aprastuta, is intimated by the des- cription of an object on hand, prastuta. In <strong>APRASTUTAPRASAMSA</strong>, the object on hand is intimated by the description of an object not on hand. In <strong>PARYAYOKTAM</strong>, what is to be intimated is expressed by a turn of speech―by words which do not express it but by words which suggest it. In <strong>VYAJASTUTI</strong>, praise is understood by apparent censure and censure is understood by apparent praise.</p>

<p><strong>SHOKTI</strong>, we have an absence of the effect notwithstanding the existence of a cause, or in other words, we have a cause without an effect. In <strong>VIRODHA</strong>, we have both the objects represented as apparently contradicting each other. In <strong>ASANGATI</strong>, we have a cause and the effect represented as occupying two different localities. In <strong>VISHAMA</strong>, we have a cause opposed to its effect. In <strong>VYAGHATA</strong>, we have one and the same cause producing different effects— one natural and the other the exact opposite. In <strong>PRAUDHOKTI</strong>, we I have simply an attribution of a cause to an effect as boldly asserted by the poet which cause cannot form the cause of that effect. <strong>In HETU 2ND SORT</strong>, we have a cause identified with its effect.</p>

<p>In <strong>PARYAYA</strong>, we have one object residing in many places, or many objects in one and the same place, <em>in succession</em>. In <strong>VISESHA 2ND KIND,</strong> we have one <em>object existing</em> in many places, <em>i.e.</em>, residing in many places simultaneously.</p>

<p>In <strong>SAMADHI</strong>, the effect of an act through one cause is facilitated by the accidental operation of another cause and this cause is therefore more powerful than the other and hence we have in</p>
<p><em>samadhi</em> unequal causes. In <strong>SAMUCHCHAYA 2ND KIND,</strong> all causes are equally powerful in bringing out the same effect with emulation as the Maxim of the Threshing floor and the Pegions*<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><em>, i.e.,</em> just as the pegions alight together upon a threshing floor, each with emulation.</p>

<p>In <strong>ARTHANTARANYASA,</strong> have two statements one of which illustrates the other, <em>i.e.</em>, one contains a justificative reason for confirming the other and thus we have here a relation of general and particular. <strong>In</strong> <strong>KAVYALINGA</strong>, one statement forms an implied completive reason for the other and we have no such relation of the general and the particular.</p>
