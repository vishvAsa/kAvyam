**सदास्वाद**  

  

प्रसादवन्तो न कृशानवन्तु परन्तु विश्वावसवन्तु सन्तः 

  

(prasādavanto na kṛśānavantu parantu viśvāvasavantu santaḥ)

  

MEANING:

> 
> > "May the good men be pleased, and not 'Kṛśānu' my work; instead may > they 'Viśvāvasu' it". Note the sonorous internal rhyme of '-nt' > sounds. The quoted words are used as verbs, a very curious > construction. It is often noted that English has a remarkable > dexterity with its verbs -- for example, it's barely been a few years > since it became commonly known, and yet "to google" and "to facebook" > seem perfectly normal. Sanskrit too has this flexibility. Here, the > verbs are created from proper names. So what does 'Kṛśānu'-ing or > 'Viśvāvasu'-ing something mean? Read on! >

CONTEXT:

> 
> > 
> > 
> > Today's phrase is taken from the Viśva-guṇādarśa Campū ("Mirror to the > world's qualities") of Veṅkaṭādhvari.Veṅkaṭādhvari was a southern > poet who lived about 400 years ago, near the city of Kanchi. He was a > very religious-minded Sri-vaishnavite scholar of the Vadakalai school. > He is most famous for his Lakṣmī-sahasraṃ, modeled on Pādukā-sahasraṃ > of Vedanta Deśika, whom he greatly admired.He is also the author of > the Rāghava-yādavīyaṃ, one of several "anuloma viloma kāvya" (two-way) > works in Sanskrit: when read normally, it relates the story of Rama, > but when each verse is read backwards, the story of Krishna!
> > 
> > 
> >   
> > 
> > 
> > The Viśva-guṇādarśa-campū is a very interesting collection of ideas, > some implemented for the first time in Sanskrit literature. It relates > the conversation of two Gandharvas (celestial beings) who are roaming > all over India in their flying car. One of them, Viśvāvasu is an > eternal optimist who sees only the good in everything. His friend, > Kṛśānu is a perennial pessimist and sees only the worst in everything. > As they hop from place to place, the poet uses his characters to > describe the good and bad in everything, from places to mythical > characters to stereotypes of various regions and professions. Clearly > assigning roles to the two characters allows the poet to free himself > of having to judge or balance his opinion, and to deliver with full > force on both sides. What's more, it helps the poet give a complete > picture without getting lost in valuations. In some cases though, it's > clear that he enjoyed one side more than the other, usually the > negative one :-)

> > What becomes apparent very early on is thatVeṅkaṭādhvari is a > brilliant filigree artist. He excels at the level of words, sounds and > internal rhymes. It is also evident that he is a learned poet, and > more importantly, a learned man's poet: masterly use of rare > grammatical forms, unconventional sentence constructions and complex > puns. The very prominence of these traits, however, automatically > highlight the conspicuous lack of some other good ones. For example, > while he excels at micro-artistry, it becomes evident that the poet is > no architect. His pair of characters hop around haphazardly all over > the country, sometimes covering its entire length in just a couple > verses, while sometimes not even moving past two tiny temple-towns > over several tens! Contrast this with the meticulous attention to > reality in the Meghaduta: not only is the path of the cloud precisely > that of a real monsoon, even the locations and *flowering**of plants* > is correctly synchronized! Next, whileVeṅkaṭādhvari impresses with > his scholarly wordplay, the bulk of the subject-matter is distinctly > tied to religion, customs and their practice, and his prejudice is > sometimes visible. However, on the whole, the work comes out on top > and is a valuable addition to Sanskrit literature.
