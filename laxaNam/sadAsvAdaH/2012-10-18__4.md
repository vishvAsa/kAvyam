अतिमानुषचेष्टित:  

  

(ati-mānuṣa-ceṣṭitaḥ)

  

MEANING:

> 
> > Literally, "beyond-human-behavior", meaning "One who has acted in a > manner beyond the capacity of humans" >

CONTEXT:

> 
> > This phrase is from the Mahābhārata, from a story called > śuka-śakra-saṃvāda (parrot-Indra-conversation) in theAnuśāsana-parva. > Where can one even begin describing the greatness of this epic? We > would only begin to scratch the surface if we described it as the > aggregated voice of the Indian thought-space speaking across > millennia. Let us therefore focus quickly on today's little gem: as > tributaries to the central narrative of the Pāṇḍavas and the Kauravas, > the epic has hundreds upon hundreds of stories that exemplify morals > and offer reflection. This line is taken from one such minor story. >

One day, a > hunter, looking to kill a deer, fired a poison arrow into the root of > the tree. The poison was unexpectedly strong, and the tree slowly lost > all its leaves and withered away. All the birds which had made their > nests in it abandoned it. All, except for one little parrot.
