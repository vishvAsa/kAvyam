**सदास्वाद**  

  

गेहे किं बहुनाऽधुना गृहपतेः चौराः चरन्त्याखवः 

  

(gehe kiṃ bahunā'dhunā gṛhapateḥ caurāḥ caranty॰ākhavaḥ)

  

MEANING:

> 
> > "What more is there to say? Thieving rats now rove around the master's > house." 'kiṃ bahunā' is an expression of resignation, and is > frequently used to shift the focus from causes to effects. The phrase > automatically brings a wistful sigh with it, and is used to great > effect. So what are these rats doing, and why is the poet so > dejected?Read on! >

CONTEXT:

> 
> > 
> > Today's phrase is taken from the Bhallaṭa-śataka.Bhallaṭawas a > highly refined Kashmiri poet who lived about 1200 years ago. He was a > much-decorated poet in the court of King Avantivarman, but lost his > patronage when the successor King Shankaravarman took over. This fall > from grace very deeply influencedBhallaṭa, and many of his best poems > are about it.
> > 
> > 
> >   
> > 
> > 
> > The Bhallaṭa-śataka is one of the finest works of allegorical poetry > (i.e, consistently employing the anyokti alankara) in Sanskrit. On the > surface, each verse is addressed to subjects like animals, plants and > emotions; however, there are echoes of deeper meanings throughout. The > work is made beautiful by a twofold complexity: Firstly,Bhallaṭa was > a highly accomplished court poet and was well versed in the techniques > of ornate writing; he uses his considerable mastery ofśabdālaṅkāra > with ease. The form is beautiful in itself. Secondly, the content > consists of the intricate machinations of a highly advanced social > life. While most poets choose simple topics and try to say something > creative about them (for example, about good men, bad men, wealth, > poverty, etc.),Bhallaṭa chooses complex topics like society's > ungratefulness, the ploys of ambitious men and the perils of > over-constrained power. As always, the best way to enjoy this > double-scoop of poetic genius is to delve right in.
