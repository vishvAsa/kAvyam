**सदास्वाद**

**  
**

पूर्वसुकृतासंगेन निःसंगया भक्त्या कार्यधुरं वहन्ति  

  

(pūrva-sukṛtā-saṃgena niḥsaṃgayā bhaktyā kāryadhuraṃ vahanti)

  

MEANING:

> 
> > Literally, "(Driven) by the bonds of good deeds done to them in the > past, they bear the yoke of duty with selfless devotion". The bonds of > gratefulness are strong, while those of selfishness are absent. The > conciseness of Sanskrit shines through!

> > 
> >   
> > 

CONTEXT:

> 
> > 
> > 
> > Today's phrase is taken from the play Mudrārākṣasa written > byViśākhadatta. The play is set around time of Alexander's invasion, > and is full of plot-twists, spy games and an intense interplay of a > bunch of very smart characters. As is usual with Sanskrit authors, > little is known ofViśākhadatta except that he lived a little after > the golden age of the Guptas, and that he was a 'man of the world', > probably an administrator, before writing this play.
> > 
> > 
> >   
> > 
> > 
> > The central plot revolves around Cāṇakya, the brilliant minister > (formerly teacher at Takṣaśila), who has just established 20-year-old > Candragupta Maurya as the emperor of an India united for the first > time in recorded history, and Rākṣasa, the equally brilliant minister > of the now-completely-vanquished Nanda dynasty.Rākṣasa is on the run > after his master's fall, but loyalty being his only motivation to > live, he has sworn to depose and kill Candragupta. In the character > ofCāṇakya however,the playwright makes a brilliant choice that > elevates every character and the entire play to a wholly new > realm:Cāṇakya doesn't want to eliminateRākṣasa -- he wants to *win > him over*. He knowsRākṣasa is the most intelligent, loyal and capable > minister in the land, and would be an invaluable asset in the court > ofCandragupta. What's more, Cāṇakya deeply respectsRākṣasa's > abilities, and genuinely admires him as a person. This creates a > natural, beautiful tension in the plot, andViśākhadatta's genius has > been in fulfilling this tension to the satisfaction of readers of > fifteen hundred years and counting. >
