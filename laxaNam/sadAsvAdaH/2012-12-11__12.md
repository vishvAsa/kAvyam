**सदास्वाद**

**

हिक्काकुलः शिशुरसौ स्मरणे ममास्तु  

  

(hikkākulaḥ śiśur asau smaraṇe mamāstu)

  

## Meaning

> Literally, "Let this hiccuping infant stay in my thoughts" -- there's something of a self-perpetuating loop here, because a poetic myth prevalent virtually everywhere in India says that you gets hiccups whenever someone thinks of you! 

## Context

> In today's tombolo edition, where we move on from our Krishna-kavya run while hoping to retain it in our minds, we feature a verse from Dr. Shridhar Bhaskar Warnekar's short workVātsalya-rasāyanam ("The elixir of parental love"). The work is a Śataka on Krishna's childhood, where the idea of an all-knowing supreme being in the form of a child is explored. Dr.Warnekarwas a modern Sanskrit poet, born in the village of Warne in Satara, Maharashtra in 1918. In a rebellion against the British education system of the time, his father sent him to a traditional Sanskrit teacher whomouldedthe young Shridhar's poetic instincts. One of his important works is the much acclaimedŚrī-śiva-rājyodayam, a mahakavya on Shivaji. More details are available on a website maintained by his grandchildren [here](https://sites.google.com/a/warnekar.net/warnekar-s-network/pradnyabharati).  
> In today's verse, the poet paints a picture, and devises a clever ploy to keep the picture evergreen both in the poet's world and ours:  
> राधादिगोपवनिताभिरसंख्यवारम्  
> स्वप्नेशु जागरसुषुप्तिषु चिन्त्यमानः ।  
> वात्सल्यतः प्रणयतो दृढभक्तितश्च  
> **हिक्काकुलः शिशुरसौ स्मरणे ममास्तु ॥**  
> rādhādi-gopa-vanitābhir asaṃkhya-vāram  
> svapneśu jāgara-suṣuptiṣu cintyamānaḥ \|  
> vātsalyataḥ praṇayato dṛḍha-bhaktitaśca  
> **hikkākulaḥ śiśurasau smaraṇe mamāstu \|\|**  
> (Vasantatilaka metre, 14 syllables per line)  
> "Whom Radha and other gopis, over and over again  
> remember in their dreams, active thoughts, and even in their deepest slumbers,  
> with affection, love or devotion:  
> May that hiccuping infant stay in my thoughts"  
> The poor infant is hiccuping presumably because he's so constantly being remembered. The poet joins in, and sets up a perpetual loop :-)The last line is completely unexpected -- if the thing to remember there was 'That Lord' or 'That Krishna', or even 'That infant', it'd have been a dull *stava*, getting all of its (meagre) strength from a reference to the Vedantic triad of 'jāgrat-svapna-suṣupti' states. But 'that *hiccuping* infant' supersedes all Vedantic ideas in the poem, just as he is reputed to do so elsewhere :-) 

## Thought for today

> मा याहीत्यपमङ्गलं व्रज किल स्नेहेन शून्यं वचः  
> तिष्ठेति प्रभुता यथा रुचिकुरुष्वात्राप्युदासीनता ।  
> नो जीवामि विना त्वयेति वचनं संभाव्यते वा न वा  
> तन्मां शिक्षय भद्र यत्समुचितं वाक्यं त्वयि प्रस्थिते ॥  
> "mā yāhī"-ty-apamaṅgalaṃ "vraja" kila snehena śūnyaṃ vacaḥ  
> "tiṣṭh"-eti prabhutā "yathā ruci kuruṣvā"-trāpy-udāsīnatā \|  
> "no jīvāmi vinā tvay"-eti vacanaṃ saṃbhāvyate vā na vā  
> tanmāṃ śikṣaya bhadra yatsamucitaṃ vākyaṃ tvayi prasthite \|\|  
> Whether to dear people or dear topics, goodbyes are murky. A gopi talks about just this as she tries to bid goodbye to Krishna who is setting out for a long mission:  
> 'To say "Don't go" is inauspicious. "Go" is devoid of love. "Stay" presumes to command you. "Do whatever you want" shows indifference. "I won't live without you" is a maudlin cliche which may or may not come true. So teach me yourself, dear one, what should I tell you now?'
