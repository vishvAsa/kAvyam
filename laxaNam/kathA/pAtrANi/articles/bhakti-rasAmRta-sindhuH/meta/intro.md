This edition is entirely based on Haridas Das’s edition. (Nabadwip : Haribol Kutir, 462 Gaurābda = 1951). I have supplemented some of the commentaries with the anvaya provided by Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati in his edition of the Chaitanya Charitamrita. I have not done this for every available verse, though I may do so in the future. (Jan Brzezinski 2003-12-20)

Haridas Das has not given a detailed explanation of the sources he used in producing his edition, though he occasionally notes alternative readings. The only references I could find are to manuscripts of Vishwanath’s commentary found in the Boro Oriya and Ganga Mata Maths in Puri. He designates these as _ka _and_ kha_ respectively. Where I have noted them (i.e., only where considered credible), I have substituted a and b for _ka _and _kha. _(Jan Brzezinski 2004-09-25)
