Only two editions have been used to produce this edition of Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi: Pandit Durga Prasad and Vasudeva Lakshman Shastri Panshikar’s 1932 Nirnaya Sagara Press Kavyamala #95, reprinted by Chowkhamba in 1985, which contains Jiva Goswami’s _Locana-rocanī_ and Vishwanath’s _Ānanda-candrikā_ commentaries. This was published in Devanagari script. The second is Haridas Das’ 1955 edition, the second edition of which was edited by Kanai Lal Adhikari in 1964. This invaluable text contains the commentary of Vishnu Das, _Svātma-pramodinī,_ which was discovered in the Govindaji library in Jaipur by Haridas Das and was previously little known in the Vaishnava world. Vishnu Das was a disciple of Krishna Das Kaviraj, so his commentary comes chronologically between those of Jiva and Vishwanath. However, I have decided to place his commentary after the other two since Vishwanath is often engaged in fierce debate with Jiva, while Vishnu Das stands completely outside the discussion of many of the theological points (primarily the debate over the svakīyā-parakīyā issue) that are of major interest to these two giants.

Vishnudas’s commentary is however of great interest to both the beginning and advanced student of the _Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi_, as he provides a detailed grammatical analysis of many verses that are taken as self-evident by the other commentators. At the same time, he offers a profuse collection of illustrations from other Vaishnava works to supplement the examples offered by Rupa in the original text. He is also more exhaustive in supplying context from the

_Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu_, the study of which may be considered a prerequisite to the reading of _Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi_.

All three commentaries often differ on the contexts of different example verses, but it is Vishwanath who tends to elaborate most dramatically in providing these contexts.
