ABSTRACT

This thesis, titled A Qualitative Approach to the Psychology of Three Self-conscious Emotions from Sanskrit Poetics, represents a coming together of the fields of mainstream contemporary psychology, Indian psychology, emotion studies, Sanskrit poetics, Indian philosophical systems allied to Sanskrit poetics (especially the Samkhya system), and Sanskrit literature to foster an understanding of asūyā, garva, and vrīḍā – three mental states listed, described, and illustrated through vignettes by Sanskrit aestheticians. 

Though one of the objectives of this thesis is to study these mental states by juxtaposing them with their corresponding psychological categories, namely, the self-conscious emotions of envy/jealousy, pride, and shame/guilt/embarrassment, a more important objective is to understand them in their own right. Towards achieving this latter objective, the thesis delves into Sanskrit poetics and allied Indian knowledge systems not only for extracting documented textual information on asūyā, garva, and vrīḍā but also for evolving three interrelated indigenous models that facilitate understanding of mental states in general+++(4)+++ and applying the models to analyze three traditionally supplied vignette verses that illustrate asūyā, garva, and vrīḍā as they are communicated to the audience through specific literary characters. 

Among the three models alluded to above, 

- model 1 looks at mental states in isolation: To understand a mental state is to have information about its antecedent stimulus and consequent response. 
- Model 2 regards mental states as meaningful in their dynamic interrelationship with other mental states. The schematic representation of this interrelationship can be termed ‘mental state signature’ – a new concept introduced in this thesis. 
- According to model 3, the most context-sensitive of the three models, to understand a mental state is to understand the character possessing it, particularly his/her personality type and personality-related life-goal.

The mental state signature of a character remains more or less stable as long as his/her life-goal remains stable. Mental states such as asūyā, garva, and  vrīḍā assume importance in this model as indicators of a character’s personality type and lifegoal. Put differently, the occurrence or non-occurrence of a mental state in a given character, its occurrence in him/her from exposure to specific antecedent stimuli, and the unique consequent responses through which he/she expresses it correlate with the personality type to which he/she belongs.+++(4)+++ 

Primary characters, such as the hero and the heroine, can be conceived of as prototypes that possess a stable personality and life-goal. In contrast, secondary characters, such as the anti-hero, may be non-prototypical with fluid personalities and lifegoals. Real-world individuals are more like secondary than primary, characters.+++(4)+++ 

Model 3 has implication for an indigenous form of therapy in which individuals can gain information about their life-goals by becoming aware of their mental states and such information can be used to modulate their life-goals in such a way that their experience of pleasurable mental states is maximized and at the same time their experience of displeasurable mental states is minimized.
