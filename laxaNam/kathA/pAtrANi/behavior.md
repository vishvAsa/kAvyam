## Classification
- According to behaviorists, only „overt‟ events – objectively observable activities such as physical movements that can be independently verified by observers.
  - Classification 1
    - verbal - spoken sentences
    - vocal - phonetic features such as timber and pitch
    - nonverbal - facial expressions, gestures, and postures
  - Displays are actions that function “as stimuli capable of influencing the behavior of other individuals”
- cognitivists also bring „covert‟ events – objectively unobservable cognitions and emotions as well as physiological processes
  - Relies on verbal reports and physiological observations


## Communication of bhāva-s
- Real life situations
  - Can infer real-life mental states (sthāyibhāva-s) by accessing information about their antecedent stimuli (kāraṇa-s) (+ transient sahakāri-kāraṇas) and consequent responses (kārya-s).
  - sthāyibhāva itself cannot be directly communicated (in the sense that the corresponding emotion arises in the recipient). It can only be inferred.
  - Inferred mental state is strongly tied to the person involved.
  - Can trouble the viewer (if not detached).
- Within a poetic work
  - vibhāva corresponds to kāraṇa. Includes such things as season, time of the day etc..
  - anubhāva corresponds to kārya. It includes actions such as crying and laughter. It is oft communicated via (possibly imagined) acting.
  - vyabhicāribhāvas are communicated via their anubhāvas.
  - vibhāva corresponds to kāraṇa. Includes such things as season, time of the day etc..
  - anubhāva corresponds to kārya. It includes actions such as crying and laughter. It is oft communicated via acting.
  - vyabhicāribhāvas are communicated via their anubhāvas.
  - sthāyibhāva is located within the character.
- Each bhāva (vyabhicāri or sthāyibhāva) is communicated thus.

### Mode of inference
- People like abhinavagupta claim that the inference here is different from the real-world counterpart, and call it ‘dhvani’ aka 'implicature'.
- People like shankuka say that the inference part here is exactly the same whether on stage or in real-world.
