## अहङ्कारोद्भवः
- कर्मफलानि। ततो वर्तमाना व्यक्तिः। 
- Personality type = f(traits, life-goal)
- Traits lead to actions. 
- Actions
  - Some actions aid attainment of object in line with पुरुषार्थ।
  - Actions may be successful or unsuccessful. In case of udātta or śānta characters, actions (reg. dharma and moxa) are unlikely to be unsuccessful as they have the "prajñā" trait. 
- Self identity types
  - Trait based - "I am smart.", "I am educated in the arts."
    - Oft seen where life-goal is artha or kāma.
    - Unsuccessful actions result in ill-being.
  - Action based 
    - Eg. dhArmika person, in whom all great traits are present.
    - In udātta or śānta character, ahaṅkāra is based on performance of action, rather than on success. So, no ill-being.
