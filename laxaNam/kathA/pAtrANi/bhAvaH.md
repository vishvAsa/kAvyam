## Mental factulties and states
- Conventional classification - cognition, affect, and conation (or motivation).
  - Some add consciousness to the above.

## Conation/ Motivation
- the proactive (as opposed to habitual) part of motivation that connects knowledge, affects, drives, desire, and instincts to behavior
- Related to Goal and agency.
- Goal - an end state that the organism has not yet attained (and is focused towards attaining in the future) and that the organism is committed to approach or avoid

### Classes
Hindu puruṣārtha classification.

Schmuck, Kasser, & Ryan (2000)

- intrinsic (e.g., self-acceptance, affiliation, community feeling) 
- extrinsic (e.g., financial success, appearance, popularity)

Chulef, Read, and Walsh (2001) have classified behavior-relevant human goals into 

- family-related goals (including family, marriage, sex, and romance), 
- interpersonal goals (including physical appearance, health, social life, friends, helping others, leadership, etc.), 
- intrapersonal goals (including ethics, freedom, entertainment, intellect, aesthetics, religion, finances, etc.).

## Cognition
- all forms of knowing and awareness, such as perceiving, conceiving, remembering, reasoning, judging, imagining, and problem solving

## Affect/ Emotions
### Study approaches
- Basic emotions approach (good for basic emotions)

#### Cognitive appraisal approach
- emotions are equated with „emotion episodes‟
- Bidirectional relationship between the components of an emotion (stimulus, perception, appraisal etc..) episode
- Some studying emotions using non-linear dynamical systems models

#### Psychological constructionist approach
- subjective experience. Commencing with a change in core affect, can culminate in categorizing and labeling the episode as fear, anger etc..
- core effect 
  - a neurophysiological primitive building block for all mental states (emotion included)
  - constantly changing (because of more or less obvious, internal or external, stimuli) along its two dimensions
    - pleasure-displeasure (valance)
    - activation-deactivation (arousal)
- categorization and labeling of core affect
  - Important in determining action that is optimized for goal-attainment in a given stimulus situation

#### Social constructionist approach
- cultural and social contexts determine which stimulus must give rise to which response.
- cultural contexts supply norms - embedded in the nervous system or in language.
- actual unfolding of an emotional episode calls for an immediate social context

#### Narrative methodology
##### Components
- paying attention to the structure of emotional narrative 
  - whether events described end in a climax or not, 
  - pace of the narrative, order of events
  - temporal and cause-effect relationships among events
  - juxtaposition of opposing or comparative narratives
  - emotional nature of an entire narrative such as in structuring it as a comedy or tragedy
- narrative construction of agency, 
- expression of emotions at the level of words, sentences, and prosody

##### Construction
- Construction by discourse, i.e., through the use of language (including emotion words) and language-like signs (i.e., expressions) in accordance to local norms.
- Construction by stories
  - mental states (including emotions) are akin to stories in having a beginning, middle, and end as well as in forming a unified whole
  - Stories become narratives when we give them a verbal or non-verbal form
  - prototypical narratives as those that “have a telic structure including an agent, a goal, and a causal sequence connecting the agent‟s various actions with the achievement or nonachievement of the goal”, some of them have sustained cultural interest
    - prototype of sorrow, for example, is “what you feel like when someone you love dies and express through weeping”
    - junctural emotions -  fear, disgust, anger, wonder, mirth that are temporally limited in their scope within the narrative
    - outcome emotions - happiness and sorrow “define the enduring feelings we prototypically consider the final evaluation points for junctural emotions”
    - prototypical narratives from across the globe are similar: their heroes pursue the goals of romantic union or power; realization or nonrealization of goals results in the end emotions of happiness or sorrow; and depending on whether its end emotion is happiness or sorrow, a prototypical narrative can fall under the genre of tragi-comedy or tragedy respectively.
  - close relationship between our real-life “ego-centric” emotions and the “empathetic” emotions that we experience while reading a piece of literature


#### Aspects
- vibhāva, bhāva and anubhāva - considered separately.
- (a) stimulus object, event, or situation; 
- (b) perception of the stimulus;
- (c) cognitive appraisal or evaluation of the perceived stimulus;
- (d) psychological preparation (action tendency) for responding to the appraised stimulus in a specific way;
- (e) bodily preparation, via physiological changes, for responding to the appraised stimulus in a specific way;
- (f) coordinated set of verbal and/or nonverbal behavioral responses;
- (g) subjective experience (feeling); and
- (h) regulation of subjective feeling.

### Basic emotions
- sadness, fear, anger, etc.
- emerge early in life,
- perform a survival-related function, 
- associated with a universally recognizable facial expression
- rigid stimulus-response pairing
- have a well-documented neurobiological basis - subcortical neural circuit or „affect program‟
- recruit fewer cognitive processes; aspects such as feeling and appraisal are not integral to basic emotions

### Self-conscious emotions
- Aka „emotions of self-assessment‟, „self-evaluative emotions‟, „self-reflexive emotions‟, „non-basic emotions‟, „moral emotions‟
- “an emotion generated when events reflect on the worth or value of the self in one‟s own or others‟ eyes”.
- occur only when people “become aware that they have lived up to, or failed to live up to, some actual or ideal self-representation”. 
- Positve vs Negative types
  - positive emotions such as pride, empathy, respect, honor
  - negative ones such as envy, jealousy, shame, guilt, embarrassment, and humiliation
- self-evaluative vs social comparison
  - self-evaluative -  guilt, shame, embarrassment, and pride
  - social comparison - envy and jealously
- Provides feedback for (regulating) future behavior
  - inform us about our “social and moral acceptability”
  - individual chooses a future behavior after evaluating the emotional consequence (in terms of shame, guilt, pride, etc.) of performing it
- Contrast with basic emotions
  - have a less clear-cut neurobiological basis, 
  - emerge later in life
  - perform a social (rather than survival-related) function
  - are not associated with a universally recognizable facial expression,
  - require complex cognitive mechanisms. necessitate an extended self.

## 49 vṛtti-s
- 49 modes (vṛtti-s) in which the mind (citta) can exist. Aka bhāva-s.
- not all mental states are capable of being communicated to the same degree.

### sthāyibhāva
- 8 or 9 enduring mental states (sthāyibhāva-s).
  -  रति, हास, शोक, क्रोध, उत्साह, भय, जुगुप्सा, विस्मय (desire, mirth, sorrow, heroism, anger, fear, aversion, and astonishment).
- Examples of enduring mental states include love, anger, fear, and sorrow. 
- Communicated using accessory mental states.
- Communication to a sahRdaya transforms it into its aesthetic counterpart - its ‘rasa’ in him. 
  - शृङ्गार-वीर-बीभत्स-रौद्र-हास्य-भयानकाः । करुणाद्भुत-शान्ताश् च नव नाट्या रसाः स्मृताः ॥
- Certain sthāyibhāvas can be vyabhicāri, based on another sthāyibhāva appearing in the character, and itself be the base for other vyabhicāri-bhāvas.

### vyabhicāri-bhāva
- 41 accessory transient (vyabhicāri-bhāva-s)
- 33 purely mental states. Eg. pride, jealousy, recollection, shame, and apprehension.
- 8 psychophysical states (sāttvika-bhāva-s). 
  - Eg. tear flow, perspiration, palpitation, and goose bumps. 
  - Understood as having an internal (psychophysiological) and an external (physical) aspect to them. The सात्त्विकभावs have a dual nature, of अनुभाव (tear flow) and  व्यभिचारिभाव.

## Consciousness
- According to Northoff (2014), consciousness can be characterized in terms of 
  - its content (persons, objects, and events), 
  - level (related to the degree of wakefulness), 
  - form (the organization of discretely occurring content into a spatiotemporal continuum),
  - qualitative feel,
  - unitary (as opposed to fragmented) nature of experience,
  - intentionality (object-directedness), 
  - relatedness to a particular self.
- Stages
  - „anoetic‟ („unknowing‟). 
    - sensory, affective, and homeostatic experience in the absence of objective awareness.
  - „noetic‟ („knowing‟).
    - factual, momentary, and non-experiential knowledge about oneself and the world.
  - „autonoetic‟ („self-knowing‟). indicative of trans-temporal and trans-spatial, experientially rich self-reflection.


## Well-being
- Well-being is a function of dominant puruṣārtha and traits as per bhoja. Considered separately.
- According to some, well-being of an individual is a function of the type of goal (i.e., intrinsic or extrinsic), reason why he/she pursues them
  (i.e., whether due to reflective volition or because of feeling pressurized), personality, traits.
