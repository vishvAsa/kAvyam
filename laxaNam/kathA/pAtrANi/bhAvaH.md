## Mental factulties and states
- Conventional classification - cognition, affect, and conation (or motivation).
  - Some add consciousness to the above.

## Conation/ Motivation
- the proactive (as opposed to habitual) part of motivation that connects knowledge, affects, drives, desire, and instincts to behavior
- Related to Goal and agency.
- Goal - an end state that the organism has not yet attained (and is focused towards attaining in the future) and that the organism is committed to approach or avoid

### Classes
Hindu puruṣārtha classification.

Schmuck, Kasser, & Ryan (2000)

- intrinsic (e.g., self-acceptance, affiliation, community feeling) 
- extrinsic (e.g., financial success, appearance, popularity)

Chulef, Read, and Walsh (2001) have classified behavior-relevant human goals into 

- family-related goals (including family, marriage, sex, and romance), 
- interpersonal goals (including physical appearance, health, social life, friends, helping others, leadership, etc.), 
- intrapersonal goals (including ethics, freedom, entertainment, intellect, aesthetics, religion, finances, etc.).

## Cognition
- all forms of knowing and awareness, such as perceiving, conceiving, remembering, reasoning, judging, imagining, and problem solving

## Affect/ Emotions
### Study approaches
- Basic emotions approach (good for basic emotions)
- cognitive appraisal approach
  - emotions are equated with „emotion episodes‟
  - Bidirectional relationship between the components of an emotion (stimulus, perception, appraisal etc..) episode
  - Some studying emotions using non-linear dynamical systems models
- Psychological constructionist approach
  - subjective experience. Commencing with a change in core affect, can culminate in categorizing and labeling the episode as fear, anger etc..
  - core effect 
    - a neurophysiological primitive building block for all mental states (emotion included)
    - constantly changing (because of more or less obvious, internal or external, stimuli) along its two dimensions
      - pleasure-displeasure (valance)
      - activation-deactivation (arousal)
  - categorization and labeling of core affect
    - Important in determining action that is optimized for goal-attainment in a given stimulus situation
- social constructionist approach
  - cultural and social contexts determine which stimulus must give rise to which response.
  - cultural contexts supply norms - embedded in the nervous system or in language.
  - actual unfolding of an emotional episode calls for an immediate social context
  - Construction by discourse, i.e., through the use of language (including emotion words) and language-like signs (i.e., expressions) in accordance to local norms.
  - Construction by stories
    - mental states (including emotions) are akin to stories in having a beginning, middle, and end as well as in forming a unified whole
    - Stories become narratives when we give them a verbal or non-verbal form
    - prototypical narratives as those that “have a telic structure including an agent, a goal, and a causal sequence connecting the agent‟s various actions with the achievement or nonachievement of the goal” and regards “stories that have sustained interest within their respective traditions”
  


#### Aspects
- vibhāva, bhāva and anubhāva - considered separately.
- (a) stimulus object, event, or situation; 
- (b) perception of the stimulus;
- (c) cognitive appraisal or evaluation of the perceived stimulus;
- (d) psychological preparation (action tendency) for responding to the appraised stimulus in a specific way;
- (e) bodily preparation, via physiological changes, for responding to the appraised stimulus in a specific way;
- (f) coordinated set of verbal and/or nonverbal behavioral responses;
- (g) subjective experience (feeling); and
- (h) regulation of subjective feeling.

### Basic vs self-conscious
- basic 
  - sadness, fear, anger, etc.
  - emerge early in life,
  - perform a survival-related function, 
  - associated with a universally recognizable facial expression
  - rigid stimulus-response pairing
  - have a well-documented neurobiological basis - subcortical neural circuit or „affect program‟
  - recruit fewer cognitive processes; aspects such as feeling and appraisal are not integral to basic emotions
- self-conscious
  - (the commonly studied of which are shame, guilt, pride, jealousy, and envy) 
  - that have a less clear-cut neurobiological basis, emerge later in life, perform a social function, are not associated with a universally recognizable facial expression, and require complex cognitive mechanisms.

## 49 vṛtti-s
- 49 modes (vṛtti-s) in which the mind (citta) can exist. Aka bhāva-s.
- not all mental states are capable of being communicated to the same degree.

### sthāyibhāva
- 8 or 9 enduring mental states (sthāyibhāva-s).
  -  रति, हास, शोक, क्रोध, उत्साह, भय, जुगुप्सा, विस्मय (desire, mirth, sorrow, heroism, anger, fear, aversion, and astonishment).
- Examples of enduring mental states include love, anger, fear, and sorrow. 
- Communicated using accessory mental states.
- Communication to a sahRdaya transforms it into its aesthetic counterpart - its ‘rasa’ in him. 
  - शृङ्गार-वीर-बीभत्स-रौद्र-हास्य-भयानकाः । करुणाद्भुत-शान्ताश् च नव नाट्या रसाः स्मृताः ॥
- Certain sthāyibhāvas can be vyabhicāri, based on another sthāyibhāva appearing in the character, and itself be the base for other vyabhicāri-bhāvas.

### vyabhicāri-bhāva
- 41 accessory transient (vyabhicāri-bhāva-s)
- 33 purely mental states. Eg. pride, jealousy, recollection, shame, and apprehension.
- 8 psychophysical states (sāttvika-bhāva-s). 
  - Eg. tear flow, perspiration, palpitation, and goose bumps. 
  - Understood as having an internal (psychophysiological) and an external (physical) aspect to them. The सात्त्विकभावs have a dual nature, of अनुभाव (tear flow) and  व्यभिचारिभाव.

## Consciousness
- According to Northoff (2014), consciousness can be characterized in terms of 
  - its content (persons, objects, and events), 
  - level (related to the degree of wakefulness), 
  - form (the organization of discretely occurring content into a spatiotemporal continuum),
  - qualitative feel,
  - unitary (as opposed to fragmented) nature of experience,
  - intentionality (object-directedness), 
  - relatedness to a particular self.
- Stages
  - „anoetic‟ („unknowing‟). 
    - sensory, affective, and homeostatic experience in the absence of objective awareness.
  - „noetic‟ („knowing‟).
    - factual, momentary, and non-experiential knowledge about oneself and the world.
  - „autonoetic‟ („self-knowing‟). indicative of trans-temporal and trans-spatial, experientially rich self-reflection.


## Well-being
- Well-being is a function of dominant puruṣārtha and traits as per bhoja. Considered separately.
- According to some, well-being of an individual is a function of the type of goal (i.e., intrinsic or extrinsic), reason why he/she pursues them
  (i.e., whether due to reflective volition or because of feeling pressurized), personality, traits.
