## रसिकः
- सहृदयः। 
- Aesthetic distance इति मुख्यो गुणः। 

### सुखस्थ-पर्युत्सुकता, अनित्यता, अपूर्णता
कालिदास आह - 

> रम्याणि वीक्ष्य मधुरांश्च निशम्य शब्दान्   
> पर्युत्सुको भवति यत्सुखितोऽपि जन्तुः ।

- अनित्यता ऽपूर्णता च सहृदयत्व-जनन-हेतू। ताभ्यां हि सहृदयः "Aesthetic distance" इति लभते। 
  - वाब्य्-आख्याम् अनित्यताम् सौन्दर्यहेतुम् मन्यमाना उषस्पुत्राः स्मार्यन्ते। [wabi sabi wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi ) 
  - "Capre Diem", "Thumpus Fugit" इति म्लेच्छाः। अनित्यता दुःखस्यैव हेतुरिति कैश्चिन् मृषोक्तम्।
- त्रिकशास्त्रस्य निरानन्देन सहापि सम्बन्धः कश्चन स्यात्।

## रसः
- Highly efficient communication (via vibhāva, anubhāva and sahakāri-bhāva-s) of an enduring mental state (to a person maintaining aesthetic distance) transforms it into its aesthetic counterpart - its ‘rasa’.
- प्रमाणवाक्यानि
  - भरत-रस-सूत्रम् - विभावानुभाव-व्यभिचारि-संयोगाद् रसनिष्पत्तिः।
  - दण्डी काव्यादर्शे - "रतिः शृङ्गारतां गता रूपबाहुल्ययोगेन"।

### रसोद्भवः
<details open><summary>अभिनवगुप्त-मतम्</summary>

- sādhāraṇīkr̥ta vibhāva, anubhāva and sahakāri-bhāva-s are associated with sādhāraṇīkr̥ta sthāyibhāva. (Impersonal, generalized versions of their real world and poetic counterparts).
  - These transcend spatio-temporal barriers. They exist in all.
- While enjoying a poetic work, mirrored in the spectator's mind thanks to shared consciousness.

<details><summary>Enrichment of sthAyibhAva as rasa?</summary>

lollaTa says that characters (eg. rAma) already has the sthāyibhāva (eg. sadness) before the vibhāva-s, vyabhicāribhāvas and anubhāvas "enrich" it. So, he located 'rasa' in the character. shankuka disagreed  -

- How can you discern sthāyibhāva without vibhāva, vyabhicāribhāvas and anubhāvas?
- If it were so, bharata would have dealt with sthāyibhāvas and then rasas. Separate definition of rasas would be superfluous.
- There would be innumerable gradations of rasa-s based on degree of enrichment.
  - If we say rasa is reached when there is utmost enrichment, 6 types of hAsya would not be possible.
  - Gradations in each of shRngAra-rasa's 10 stages would lead to infinite number of shRngAra-rasas.
- Despite continuous enrichment, how come shoka first is intense and then weakens?
- Inspite of other vibhāvas, vyabhicāribhāvas and anubhāvas enriching krodha, utsAha and rati, these sthāyibhāvas remain weak in the absence of amrSha, sthairya and sevA.

<details><summary>Imitation of sthāyibhāva as rasa?</summary>

Shankuka says: 

- The character's sthāyibhāva is imitated in the actor/ poetic presentation via a combination of  vibhāvas, vyabhicāribhāvas and anubhāvas. 
- This imitated sthāyibhāva, when inferred by the audience with the superimposition "This is that rAma who was happy", it becomes rasa. 
- So, he located rasa in the actor (real or imagined).
- Some vibhāvas (which include rainy season) are communicated via poetry/ storyline.

bhaTTatauta's criticism:

- There is no imitation as per spectator experience. Spectator does not actually think that the actor is imitating the mental state of the character.
  - One can't say that movements of limbs imitates feelings. Especially when these movements are located in different parts of the body and perceived using different senses. 
  - No one has knowledge of rAma's love - original cannot be percieved. To declare something an imitation, one should know both the original and the copy.
  - If the actor's own love is being termed "imitation of love of the character" - this doesn't make sense because the actor's love is then original; and it is being percieved as real life love.
  - How can unreal counterparts "vibhāva and anubhāva" of actual "kAraNa and kArya" lead to perception of sthāyibhāva which seems real to the audience? So it can't be real sthāyibhāva which is percieved. 
  - If you say it is imitated sthāyibhāva which is percieved - no educated or uneducated audience thinks that they are percieving an imitation. One does not infer "imitation fire" from mist looking like smoke.
  - If you say that the actor's love is similar to the character's love, then similitude is not imitation. Cow is not an imitation of a gavaya, despite being similar.
  - The cognition "This is that rAma who was happy" is negated after the performance; and by performance by different actors. So, rAmaness is a jAti.
- There is no imitation as per actor's experience.
  - Actor has never seen rAma. Can't imitate some protopype - has to be someone particular. So, one ends up in a position where one is imitating oneself ("I imitate someone who cries like this").
  - If imitation means doing something after someone else has done it - this spills over to the real world. So it is not a "suffcient" characterization.
  - The actor does not really imitate sorrow with one's own sorrow - since it is not felt as such by the actor (check MRI). Further, feelings cannot be imitated by physical movments or even intonations.
- bharata never mentions that imitation of sthāyibhāva is happening (अनुकरण in the first chapter being taken in a specific different sense). In fact the contrary - actors sing songs when in love - which does not happen in real life.
- vibhāvas are not communicated via the script.
  - The actor does not think- "this is a sItA who belongs to me". +++(??)+++
  - If you say that vibhāvas are communicated by the script, they may as well communicate sthāyibhāvas.

      - Abhinavagupta's objections
        - There should be 9 ways of bhoga - one for each rasa?
        - guNa-s can be combined in many ways. So, there can be innumerable types of bhoa. Why pick just these?
- Generalized mental states are not present in any particular person - so - like other generalized/ ideal objects - cannot be percieved.
  - Abhinavagupta 
    - "bhoga" is also perception. Unpercieved object cannot be confirmed.
    - "Generalized mental state" is located everywhere - rather than in a single person.
- Not percieved in spectator as something personal.
  - Not by direct experience
    - Else he would feel sad on experiencing karuNa rasa. 
    - Watching a drama about sItA would become a vibhāva for one's own love IRL.
    - sAdhAraNIkaraNa occurs even in case of supernatural acts like leaping accross the ocean. 
  - Not from memory.
    - There is no remembrance of anything personal while watching sItA.
    - There is no spectator memory of rAma as possessing a stable emotion.
  - Not from shabda-pramANa or anumAna. Such intellectual activity cannot provide immediate rasa experience. Also, revelation can happen in gradations - leading to gradations of rasa.
- Not percieved in actor.
  - Would lead to indifference in spectators.
- Generalized mental states are not produced or manifested.
  - Abhinavagupta  - Rasa is neither eternal (exists only as long as one engages with the text) nor unreal (is in fact experienced). So it must be either be produced or manifested.
