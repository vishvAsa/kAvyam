  <p>1. I shall now speak of the distribution of roles in a play or of the kinds of men by which different roles are to be represented.</p>
<h2 id="general-principles-of-distribution"><em>General Principles of Distribution</em></h2>
<p>2. After considering together their gait, speech and movement of limbs as well as their strength and nature, the experts are to employ actors to represent different roles [in a play].</p>
<p>3. Hence the selection of actors should be preceded by an enquiry into their merits. The Director (lit. the master) will not feel difficulty in the choice [if such procedure is followed].</p>
<p>4. After ascertaining their natural aptitudes, he is to distribute roles to different actors.</p>
<h2 id="the-role-of-gods"><em>The Role of gods</em></h2>
<p>5-6. Persons who have all the limbs intact, well-formed and thick-set, who are full-grown (<em>vayo&rsquo;nvita</em>), not fat or lean or tall or large, who have vivacity, pleasant voice and good appearance, should be employed to take up the role of gods.</p>
<h2 id="the-role-of-rākṣasas-etc"><em>The Role of Rākṣasas etc.</em></h2>
<p>7-8. Persons who are fat, and have a large body and a voice like the peal of thunder (lit. cloud), furious looking eyes and naturally knit eyebrows, should be employed to take up the role of Rākṣasas, Dānavas and Daityas; for the performance of male actors [should be] in conformity with their limbs and movements.</p>
<h2 id="the-role-of-kings"><em>The Role of Kings</em></h2>
<p>9-11. Actors of the best kind who have beautiful eyes, eyebrows, forehead, nose, lips, cheeks, face, neck, and every other limbs beautiful, and who are tall, possessed of pleasant appearance, dignified gait, and are neither fat nor lean, and are well-behaved, wise and steady by nature, should be employed to represent the role of kings and princes (<em>kumāra</em>).</p>
<h2 id="the-role-of-army-leaders-and-secretaries"><em>The Role of Army-leaders and Secretaries</em></h2>
<p>12-13. Persons who have well-formed limbs, distinct speech, are neither tall nor fat, are heroic, have reasoning positive and negative, are brave, and eloquent and have presence of mind, should be employed to take up the role of army-leaders (<em>senāpati</em>) and secretaries (<em>amātya</em>).</p>
<h2 id="the-role-of-the-kañcukīyas-and-the-śrotriyas"><em>The Role of the Kañcukīyas and the Śrotriyas</em></h2>
<p>14. Persons who have brown eyes, long nose, and who are short or tall, should be employed in the role of Kañcukīyas and Śrotriyas.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="the-role-of-minor-characters"><em>The Role of Minor Characters</em></h2>
<p>15. In other cases too, similar dramatic convention has been prescribed; roles should be assigned after considering the actors’ age and physical condition.</p>
<p>16-17. [For example], persons<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> who are slow-moving, very dwarfish, hunch-backed, uncouth, odd-faced and fat, who have expressionless (lit. motionless) eyes, one eye blind, small chin and low nose, ugly raiments, evil nature, deformed body and who have marks of a slave, should be employed in the role of slaves.</p>
<h2 id="the-role-of-fatigued-persons"><em>The Role of Fatigued Persons</em></h2>
<p>18. A person who is naturally thin, should be employed in a play to represent a tired person.</p>
<h2 id="the-role-of-a-person-in-health"><em>The Role of a Person in Health</em></h2>
<p>A fat person should be employed to represent a person without any disease.</p>
<h2 id="special-cases-of-assigning-roles"><em>Special Cases of Assigning Roles</em></h2>
<p>19. If however such persons are not available, the Director (lit. the master) should exercise discretion to employ [some one] after a consideration of the latter’s nature and movement as well as States [to be represented],</p>
<p>20. Such persons’ natural movements whether good, bad or middling, should be regulated by contact with the Director (lit. the master), and then they will properly represent [all] the States.</p>
<p>21. In other cases too, similar dramatic convention has been prescribed, and roles should be assigned to persons after considering their native places (<em>deśa</em>) and costume (<em>veśa</em>).</p>
<h2 id="the-role-of-a-character-with-extra-and-special-limbs"><em>The Role of a Character with Extra and Special Limbs</em></h2>
<p>22-24. In case of characters which have many arms, many heads, and uncouth faces and faces of animals, including beasts of prey, asses, camels, horses and the like, the Director (lit. the master) should according to his direction have the masks (lit. them) made with clay, wood, lac and leather. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="the-entry-of-a-character"><em>The Entry of a Character</em></h2>
<p>24. One should not enter the stage in his own natural appearance. His own body should be covered with paints and decorations.</p>
<h2 id="the-result-of-impersonation"><em>The Result of Impersonation</em></h2>
<p>25. In the production of a play, a person in his natural form of the body, should be employed [to assume a role] according to his age and costume.</p>
<h2 id="the-method-of-proper-impersonation"><em>The Method of Proper Impersonation</em></h2>
<p>26-27. Just as a man who renounces his own nature together with his body and assumes another’s nature by entering into his body<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> so the wise actor thinking within himself that ‘I am he’ should represent the States of another person by speech, gait, gesture and other movements.</p>
<h2 id="three-kinds-of-impersonation"><em>Three Kinds of Impersonation</em></h2>
<p>28. Human characters as they are represented on the stage fall into three classes: natural (<em>anurūpā</em>), unnatural (<em>virūpā</em>) and imitative (<em>rūpānusāriṇī</em>).</p>
<h2 id="the-natural-impersonation"><em>The Natural Impersonation</em></h2>
<p>29. When women impersonate female characters and men male characters, and their ages are similar to that of the characters represented, the impersonation is called ‘natural’ (<em>anurūpā</em>).</p>
<h2 id="the-unnatural-impersonation"><em>The Unnatural Impersonation</em></h2>
<p>30. When a boy takes up the role of an old man or an old man takes up that of a boy and betrays his own nature in acting, the representation is called ‘unnatural’ (<em>virūpā</em>).</p>
<h2 id="the-imitative-impersonation"><em>The Imitative Impersonation</em></h2>
<p>31-32. When a man assumes a woman’s character,[^mg5] the impersonation is called imitative (<em>rūpānusāriṇī</em>) by the best actors. A woman also may assume if she likes, a man’s role in actual practice. But an old and a young man should not try [to imitate] each other’s manners.[^mg6]</p>
<h2 id="special-suitability-of-men-and-women"><em>Special Suitability of Men and Women</em></h2>
<p>33-34. Bold men who have heroism and strength, should be employed for recitatives, and women [should always be employed] for songs. Women’s nature is suited mostly to songs and that of men to recitatives.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> For women’s voice is naturally sweet and that of men is forceful.</p>
<p>35-36. Though men know the rules of singing in their traditional characteristics, their songs being devoid of sweetness, do not create beauty.</p>
<p>Whenever there is [any] merit in women’s recitation and sweetness of voice in men, these are to be considered as being due to freaks (lit. inversion) of nature, and as such these should be [considered] ornaments.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="women-in-mens-roles"><em>Women in Men’s Roles</em></h2>
<p>37. In temples,<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> palaces<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> and houses of army-leaders and other prominent persons, dramatic performances (<em>prayoga</em>) are mostly held by women in men’s role.</p>
<h2 id="womens-special-merit"><em>Women’s Special Merit</em></h2>
<p>38. A delicate person’s role is always to be taken up by women. Hence, in case of women as well as gods and men of delicate nature [women are to assume the roles].</p>
<p>39. [It is for this reason that] drama came to be established in heaven<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> through Rambhā, Urvaśī<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> and the like [nymphs]. And similar has been the case in king’s harems in this world.</p>
<h2 id="training-women-in-different-roles"><em>Training Women in Different Roles</em></h2>
<p>40. Directors (lit. masters) should instruct women according to the Śāstras, but they should not themselves give coaching to women in learning their [feminine] roles.</p>
<p>41-42. But masculine (lit. depending on men) roles should be carefully directed by them.</p>
<p>As natural amorousness is observed in women, their naturally graceful limbs are easily accessible to Sauṣṭhava; and sportful nature<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> will be their additional qualities (lit. ornaments) [when they assume a male role].</p>
<h2 id="result-of-proper-assignment-of-roles"><em>Result of Proper Assignment of Roles</em></h2>
<p>43. When actors and characters in a play have similar conditions and behaviour, and have natural limbs and organs (<em>karaṇa</em>), they will embellish a dramatic performance.</p>
<p>44. Want of fatigue in dance and music, is always a quality of women, and a dramatic production partly attains its sweetness and partly its strength due to this.</p>
<p>45. A woman who is an adept in the practice of love, and is an expert in [representing] love-affairs, appears through her graceful acting on the stage, like a creeper full of various charms, on account of its [many] flowers.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>
<p>46. Hence [a Director] should always bestow undivided attention to women’s exercise (<em>yogyā</em>) [in dance and music], for without this, the States, Sentiments, the Sauṣṭhava cannot be produced by them in the least.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="types-of-dramatic-production"><em>Types of Dramatic Production</em></h2>
<p>47. The production of a drama which includes many States and Sentiments, is of two kinds: delicate (<em>sukumāra</em>) and energetic (<em>āviddha</em>).</p>
<h3 id="the-delicate-type-of-production"><em>The Delicate Type of Production</em></h3>
<p>48. Nāṭaka<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>, Prakaraṇa, Bhāṇa, Vīthī and Aṅka<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> are to be known of the delicate type. For they depend on human beings.</p>
<p>49. This delicate type of production is pleasing to kings. Hence plays of this class including the Erotic Sentiment, should be produced by women.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p>
<p>50. The play in which there occur violent fighting, great speed [of movement], and much excitement, should not be enacted by females, but by males.</p>
<p>51-52. If a play includes ordinary (lit. not exalted) incidents and no hurried or violent movement of limbs, and requires an observance of proper tempo, Tāla, Kalā and regulated utterance of syllables, and clearly divided words and has plenty of desired Sentiments, it should be produced by women.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="the-energetic-type-of-production"><em>The Energetic Type of Production</em></h3>
<p>53-54. The play which requires energetic (<em>āviddha</em>) type of Aṅgahāras to represent cutting, piercing, and fighting, and includes [a representation of] the use of magic and thaumaturgy as well as artificial objects and costumes, and has among its <em>dramatis personae</em> many males and a small number of females who are of quiet nature, and mostly the Grand and the Energetic Styles applied in its production, is of the energetic type.</p>
<p>55-56. Ḍima, Samavakāra, Vyāyoga and Īhāmṛga are known to be plays of the energetic of type by producers.</p>
<p>Production of plays of this kind, should be made by [an impersonation of] gods, Dānavas and Rākṣasas.</p>
<p>56. Thus one should assign different roles in the production of a play. Next I shall speak how a play attains excellence due to costumes and make-up.</p>
<h2 id="the-typical-impersonation-of-a-king"><em>The Typical Impersonation of a King</em></h2>
<p>57-59. How are the qualities of a king to be represented by an actor who has a few wearing apparels? In this connection it has been said that when dramatic conventions have come into vogue I have made plays furnished with all these (<em>i.e</em>. conventions).</p>
<p>In them (<em>i.e</em>. plays) the actor (<em>naṭa</em>) covered with paint, and decorated with ornaments, reveal the signs of kingship when he assumes a grave and dignified attitude, and then he alone becomes, as it were, a refuge of the seven great divisions (<em>saptadvīpa</em>) of the world.</p>
<p>60-61. He should move his limbs only after he has been covered with paints. And trimmed according to the discretion of the Director and having the Sauṣṭhava of limbs, the actor becomes like a king, and [thus trimmed] the king also will be [very much] like an actor.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup></p>
<p>61-63. Just as an actor is, so is the king and just as a king is, so is the actor.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> The two will represent their States by similar deportments and Sauṣṭhava of limbs.</p>
<p>Just as by properly carrying out the instruction of the Director, the actor illumines the stage, similarly the king also will always be naturally brilliant.</p>
<p>His followers will be like that of divine personages.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> In a play they are to be introduced with proper costume, language and age.</p>
<p>64. The producer should let the actor have the natural appearance of a character [by giving him suitable costume] and by associating him with suitable age through [proper] make-up.</p>
<p>65. Thus one should make a selection of persons for representing kingly manners. I shall next speak of the qualities of a Director (<em>sūtradhāra</em>).</p>
<p>In this connection I shall speak of the qualities of a Director. First of all, he should possess knowledge of characteristics [of everything concerning the theatre], desirable refinement of speech, knowledge of the rules of Tāla and theory of notes and instruments [in general].<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup></p>

<p>It seems that boys also had to represent women’s character in the ancient Hindu theatre (see the Prastāvanā to Mālatī). And this shows the benefit of engaging actresses. Employment of boys in women’s role was considerably a handicap in depicting female characters in the Shakesperian stage. On this see “Shakespeare’s Dramatic Art” in Companion to Shakespeare Studies, Cambridge, 1946, p. 54.&#160;<a href="#fnref:12" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>This and the two following passages (66-71, 72-74) show that the Hindus had very advanced ideas about of the responsibilities of a Director. Like his modern counterpart the regisseur (or “producer” as he is called in England) he was required to be an expert not only as regards acting but in all those arts which together constitute a performance. The Komisarjevsky, The Theatre, Dondon, 1935, p. 15.

<p>Western scholars are sometime inclined to connect this character with the Śakas (Keith, Sanskrit Drama, p. 69). But Śakāra as described in DR (ii 42) and SD. (81) is nothing but the lowborn brother of a royal concubine. Naturally he bragged about his relationship with the king and was laughed at by people. Hence the term śyālaka gradually acquired a pejorative sense, and in NIA it has become śālā (a term of abuse). So people had to refer to him him euphemistically as Śa-kāra which means the fellow named with an initial ś. If the author of the NŚ. has not given such a definition, it was probably due to actual Śakāras being still available at his time he prudently remained silent about their anomalous social position.&#160;<a href="#fnref:23" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>The term “Bharata” seems to have originally meant those who sang ballads connected with the heroic exploits of the Bharata race. The term ‘Bharthari’ meaning singers on the exploits of Bhartṛhari a prince who renounced the world and attained spiritual eminence, is analogous to Bharata. The Bharata ballads were the nucleus of the Mbh. According to the hypothesis of Winternitz, such ballads gave rise to drama.
