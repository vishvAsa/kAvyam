Bhāva is an ‘instrument,’ of causation; for words, such as bhāvita, vāsita and kṛta are synonymous.

  <h2 id="bhāvas-psychological-states-explained"><em>Bhāvas (Psychological States) explained</em></h2>
<p>0. Now I shall speak of the <em>bhāvas</em> (Psychological States, <em>lit</em>. feelings). An anquiry in this connexion is, “Why are the <em>bhāvas</em> so called? Is it because they <em>bhāvayanti</em> (pervade) and are hence called <em>bhāvas</em>?” It is said in reply that <em>bhāvas</em> are so called, because through Words, Gestures and Representation of the Sattva they <em>bhāvayanti</em> (infuse) the meaning of the play [into the spectators]. <em>Bhāva</em> is an ‘instrument,’ of causation; for words, such as <em>bhāvita, vāsita</em> and <em>kṛta</em> are synonymous. An expression like, ‘O, all these things are <em>bhāvita</em> (pervaded) by one another’s smell or moistened by one another’s juice,’ is current even amongst the common people. Hence the root <em>bhāvaya</em> means ‘to cause to pervade.’ On this point there are the following Ślokas:</p>
<p>1. When the meanings presented by Determinants and Consequents are made to pervade (<em>gamayte</em>) [the heart of the spectators] they are called <em>bhāvas</em>.</p>
<p>2. As in these, the inner idea of the playwright is made to pervade [the mind of the spectators] by means of Words, Gestures, colour of the face and Representation of the Sattva, they are called <em>bhāvas</em>.</p>
<p>3. As they cause the Sentiments relating to various kinds of Histrionic Representation to pervade [the heart of spectators], they are called <em>bhāva</em> (States) by those who produce a drama.</p>
<h2 id="vibhāvas-determinants-explained"><em>Vibhāvas</em> (<em>Determinants</em>) <em>explained</em></h2>
<p>“Now, why is the word <em>vibhāva</em> used?.” [Answer]: “The word <em>vibhāva</em> is used for the sake of clear knowledge. It is synonymous with <em>kāraṇa</em>, <em>nimitta</em> and <em>hetu</em>. As Words, Gestures and Representation of the Sattva are <em>vibhāvyte</em> (determined) by this, it is called <em>vibhāva</em> (Determinant). <em>Vibhāvita</em> [also] means the same thing as <em>vijñāta</em> (clearly known). On this point there is a Śloka:</p>
<p>As many things are <em>vibhāvyate</em> (determined) by this through Words, Gestures and the Representation of the Sattva, it is named <em>vibhāva</em> (Determinant).</p>
<h2 id="anubhāvas-consequents-explained"><em>Anubhāvas</em> (<em>Consequents</em>) <em>explained</em></h2>
<p>“Now, why is the word <em>anubhāva</em> used?” (Answer) “Because this <em>anubhāvayati</em> [the spectators] (<em>i.e</em>. make them feel afterwards) [the effect of] the Histrionic Representation by means of Words, Gestures and the Sattva, it is called <em>anubhāva</em> (Consequent). On this point there is a Śloka:</p>
<p>5. As in it the play (lit. meaning) is <em>anubhāvyate</em> (made to be felt) by means of Words and Gestures, it is called <em>anubhāva</em>, and it relates to words as well as to [gestures and movements of] major and minor limbs.</p>
<p>Now we have explained that the Psychological States are related to Determinants and Consequents. Thus are Psychological States created. Hence we shall discuss the definitions and examples of the Psychological States together with their Determinants and Consequents. Of these, the Determinants and the Consequents are well-known among the people. They being connected with the human nature, their definitions are not discussed. This is for avoiding prolixity. On this point there is the Śloka:</p>
<p>6. Determinants and Consequents are known by the wise to be things which are created by human nature and are in accordance with the ways of human nature and with the ways of the world.</p>
<p>Now the the Durable Psychological States are eight in number. The Complementary Psychological States are thirty-three and the Sāttvika States are eight in number. These are the three varieties of the Psychological States. Hence we are to understand that there are forty-nine Psychogical States capable of drawing out the Sentiment from the play, The Sentiments arise from them when they are imbued with the quality of universality (<em>sāmānya</em>, lit. commonness). On this point there is a Śloka:</p>
<p>7. The Psychological State proceeding from the thing which is congenial to the heart, is the source of the Sentiment and it pervades the body just as fire spreads over dry wood.</p>
<h2 id="durable-and-other-psychological-states"><em>Durable and other Psychological States</em></h2>
<p>It is said in this connexion: “If the forty-nine Psychological States being represented by Determinants and Consequents coming into contact with one another become Sentiments when they are imbued with the quality of universality, how is it that Durable Psychological States only are changed into Sentiments [and not others]?, [In reply to this] it is said: “Just as among persons having same characteristics and similar hands, feet and belly and celebrity, some due to their birth, manners, learning and skill in arts and crafts, attain kingship, while others endowed with an inferior intellect become their attendants, in a similar manner, Determinants, Consequents and Complementary Psychological States become dependent on the Durable Psychological States. Being the shelter [of others] the Durable Psychological States become masters. Similarly other Psychological States (lit. feelings) reduced to subordination take sheter (shelter?) with them (<em>i.e</em>. the Durable Psychological States) due to superior merit [of the latter]. Those becoming their retinue are the Complementary Psychological States. “Is there any parallel instance?” [Answer.] “Just as only a king surrounded by numerous attendants receives this epithet and not any other man be he ever so great, so the Durable Psychological States only followed by Determinants, Consequents and Complimentary Psychological States, receive the name of Sentiment. [On the point] there is a traditional Sloka:</p>
<p>8. Just as a king is superior to other men, and the preceptor is superior to his disciples, so the Durable Psychological States are superior to the other Psychological States.</p>
<h2 id="durable-psychological-states"><em>Durable Psychological States</em></h2>
<p>Characteristics of these which are known as the Sentiments have been mentioned before. Now we shall discuss the marks of the Psychological States common to them. First of all we shall take up [the case of] the Durable Psychological States.</p>
<h2 id="love-rati"><em>Love (<em>rati</em>)</em></h2>
<p>Love (<em>rati</em>) which has pleasure as its basis, is caused by Determinants like seasons, garlands, unguent, ornaments, dear ones, enjoyment of a superior residential house, and absence of opposition [from any one]. It is to be represented on the stage by Consequents such as a smiling face, sweet words, motion of eyebrows, and glances and the like.</p>
<p>There is a Śloka [on this point]:</p>
<p>9. Love arises from the attainment of desired objects. Because of its agreeableness, it is to be represented on the stage by sweet words accompanied by [suitable] gestures and movements of limbs.</p>
<h2 id="laughter-hāsya"><em>Laughter (<em>hāsya</em>)</em></h2>
<p>Now, Laughter (<em>hāsya</em>) is caused by Determinants such as mimicry of others’ actions, incoherent talk, obtrusiveness, foolishness and the like. It is to be represented on the stage by means of Smile and the like.</p>
<p>On this point there is a traditional Śloka:</p>
<p>10. Laughter arises from a mimicry of other people’s actions. It is to be represented on the stage by the learned with Smile, Laughter and Excessive Laughter.</p>
<h2 id="sorrow-śoka"><em>Sorrow (<em>śoka</em>)</em></h2>

It is to be represented on the stage by Consequents such as shedding tears, lamentation, bewailing, change of colour, loss of voice, looseness of limbs, falling on the ground, crying, deep breathing, paralysis, insanity, death and the like. Weeping here (<em>i.e</em>. in a play) is of three kinds: [weeping) of joy, [weeping] of affliction and [weeping] due to jealousy. On these points there are traditional Āryās:</p>
<p>11. Weeping in which the cheeks are blooming in joy, the body is horripilating, there are words of remembrance, and tears are not concealed, is called weeping of joy.</p>
<p>12. Weeping in which there is a loud sound, copious shedding of tears, uneasiness of the body, want of steady movements and efforts, lamentation after falling on the ground, and rolling on the earth, is called weeping due to affliction.</p>
<p>13. Loud weeping of women in which the lips and the cheeks are throbbing and the head is shaking, the eyebrows and the glances are moving in anger, is called weeping due to jealousy.</p>
<p>14. Sorrow relates to women, persons of the inferior type, and it has its origin in affliction [of any kind]. With relation to it, persons of the superior and the middling types are distinguished by their patience and those of the inferior type by their weeping.</p>
<h2 id="anger-krodha"><em>Anger (<em>krodha</em>)</em></h2>
<p>Anger (<em>krodha</em>) is caused by Determinants such as insolence, abusive language, quarrel, altercation, opposing [persons or objects] and the like. It is to be represented on the stage by Consequents such as swollen nose, upturned eyes, bitten lips, throbbing cheeks and the like.</p>
<p>15. Anger is of five kinds, viz., anger caused by enemies, superior persons, lovers, servants, and feigned anger.</p>
<p>On this point there are traditional Āryās:</p>
<p>16. One should show anger against control by the enemy with knitting of eyebrows, fierce look, bitten lips, hands clasping each other, and with threatening arms, shoulder and chest.</p>
<p>17. One should show anger against control by superiors with slightly downcast eyes, wiping off slight perspiration and not expressing any violent movement.</p>

<p>19. Anger to one’s servants should be represented on the stage by means of threat, rebuke, dilated eyes and by casting angry looks of various kind.</p>
<p>20. Anger which is shown with a view to the realization of an ulterior motive and which mostly betrays marks of effort, is called feigned anger, and it relates to (lit. moves between) two Sentiments.</p>
<h2 id="energy-utsāha"><em>Energy (<em>utsāha</em>)</em></h2>
<p>Energy (<em>utsāha</em>) relates to persons of the superior type. It is caused by Determinants such as absence of sadness, power, patience, heroism and the like. It is to be represented on the stage by Consequents such as steadiness, munificence, boldness in an undertaking, and the like. On this point there is a Śloka:</p>
<p>21. Energy which has effort as its basis and which grows out of alertness and such other qualities, should be represented on the stage by acts of vigilance and the like.</p>
<h2 id="fear-bhaya"><em>Fear (<em>bhaya</em>)</em></h2>

It is caused by Determinants such as acts offending one’s superiors and the king, roaming in a forest, seeing an elephant and a snake, staying in an empty house, rebuke [from one’s superiors], a dark rainy night, hearing the hooting of owls and the cry of animals that go out at night, and the like. It is to be represented on the stage by Consequents such as, trembling hands and feet, palpitation of the heart, paralysis, dryness of the mouth, licking the lips, perspiration, tremor, apprehension [of danger], seeking safety, running away, loud crying and the like. On this point there are Ślokas:</p>
<p>22. Fear arises from an embarassment due to offending one’s superiors and the king, seeing terrible objects and hearing awful things.</p>
<p>23. This is to be represented with tremor of the limbs, panic, drying up of the mouth, hurried movement, widely opened eyes and such other gestures and actions.</p>
<p>24. Fear in men arising from terrifying objects should be represented on the stage by actors (lit. dancers) with slackened limbs and suspended movement of the eyes.</p>

<h2 id="complementary-psychological-states-vyabhicāriṇa"><em>Complementary Psychological States (<em>vyabhicāriṇa</em>)</em></h2>
<p>Durable Psychological States are to be known as described here. We shall now explain the Complementary Psychological States. “Why are these called <em>vyabhicāriṇaḥ</em>?” [In answer] it is said that <em>vi</em> and <em>abhi</em> are prefixes, and the root <em>cara</em> means ‘to go,’ ‘to move. Hence the word <em>vyabhicāriṇah</em> means ‘those that move in relation to Sentiments towards different [kinds of objects.]’ ‘Move in’ implies carrying. It is questioned, “How do they carry?” In answer it is said, “It is a popular convention to say like this, just as the people say, “The sun carries this <em>nakṣatra</em> (star) or that day.” It does not, however, mean that these are carried on arms or shoulders. But this is a popular belief. Just as the sun carries this star, so is to be understood that the Complementary Psychological States [carry the Sentiments]. These Complementary Psychological States as mentioned in the Digest are thirty three in number. We shall describe them now.</p>

<p>Fright (<em>trāsa</em>) is caused by Determinants such as flash of lightning, a meteor, thunder, earthquake, clouds, crying or howling of big animals and the like. It is to be represented on the stage by Consequents such as, shaking of narrow limbs, tremor [of the body], paralysis, horripilation, speaking with a choked voice, talking irrelevantly, and the like.</p>
<p>There is a Śloka on this point:</p>
<p>91. Fright is caused by a very terrible sound and the like. It should be represented on the stage by looseness of limbs and half-shut eyes.</p>
<h2 id="deliberation-vitarka"><em>Deliberation (<em>vitarka</em>)</em></h2>
<p>Deliberation (<em>vitarka</em>) is caused by Determinants such as doubt, cogitation, perplexity and the like. It is to be represented on the stage by Consequents such as various discussions, settling the definition, accepting the deliberation and the like.</p>
<p>There is a Śloka on this point:</p>
<p>92. Deliberation which arises from discussions and which has doubt as its basis, is to be represented on the stage by shaking of the head, the eyebrows and the eyelashes.</p>
<p>These are the thirty-three Transitory States; they are to be produced in a play by men and women of the superior, middling and inferior types in conformity with [proper] place, time and occasion.</p>
<p>93. These thirty-three are known as the Transitory States. I shall now explain in detail the Sāttvika States.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="sāttvika-states"><em>Sāttvika States</em></h2>
<p>Now it may be asked,</p>
<p>“Are these States called Sāttvika, because other States (Determinants, Consequents and Transitory States) are said to be devoid of Sattva?” [In answer] it is said that the Sattva in this connexion is [something] originating in mind. It is caused by the concentrated mind. The Sattva is accomplished by concentration of the mind. Its nature [which includes] horripilation, tears, loss of colour and the like, cannot be mimicked by an absent-minded man. The Sattva is desired in a play because of its imitating human nature. If the question is, ‘Is there any example in support of this view?’ then it may be said that in theatrical practice, situations of happiness as well as misery should so purely accord with the Sattva behind them that they may appear to be realistic (<em>yathāsvarūpa</em>). How can sorrow which has weeping as its basis, be represented on the stage by any one who is not sorry?, And how can happiness which has joy as its basis be represented on the stage by any one who is not happy? Hence the Sattva being desired [in acting] in connexion with certain States the latter are called Sāttvika. This Sattva is explained by the fact that tears and horripilation are respectively to be shown by persons who are not [actually] sorry or happy.</p>
<p>94. The eight Sāttvika States are as follows: Paralysis, Perspiration, Horripilation, Change of Voice, Trembling, Change of Colour, Weeping and Fainting.</p>
<p>Among these,</p>
<h2 id="perspiration-sveda"><em>Perspiration (<em>sveda</em>)</em></h2>
<p>95. Perspiration (<em>sveda</em>) occurs as the result of anger, fear, joy, shame, sorrow, toil, sickness, heat, exercise, fatigue, summer and massage:</p>
<h2 id="paralysis-stambha-and-trembling-prakampa"><em>Paralysis (<em>stambha</em>) and Trembling (prakampa)</em></h2>
<p>96. Paralysis (<em>stambha</em>) occurs as being due to joy, fear, sickness, surprise, sadness, intoxication and anger, and Trembling due to cold, fear, joy, anger, touch [of thebeloved] and old age.</p>
<h2 id="weeping-asra"><em>Weeping (<em>asra</em>)</em></h2>
<p>97. Weeping (<em>asra</em>) occurs as being due to joy, indignation, smoke, collyrium, yawning, fear, sorrow, looking with a steadfast gaze, cold and sickness.</p>
<h2 id="change-of-colour-and-horripilation-vaivarṇya"><em>Change of Colour and Horripilation (<em>vaivarṇya</em>)</em></h2>
<p>98. Change of Colour (<em>vaivarṇya</em>) occurs as being due to cold, anger, fear, toil, sickness, fatigue and heat, and Horripilation (<em>romāñca</em>) due to touch, fear, cold joy, anger and sickness.</p>
<h2 id="change-of-voice-svara-sāda-and-fainting-pralaya"><em>Change of Voice (<em>svara-sāda</em>) and Fainting (<em>pralaya</em>)</em></h2>
<p>99. Change of Voice (<em>svara-sāda</em>) occurs as being due to fear, joy, anger, fever, sickness and intoxication, and Fainting (<em>pralaya</em>) due to too much toil, swoon, intoxication, sleep, injury, astonishment and the like.</p>
<h2 id="representation-of-the-sāttvika-states"><em>Representation of the Sāttvika States</em></h2>
<p>100. These are to be known by the wise as the eight Sāttvika States. I shall speak afterwards about actions which will represent these States.</p>
<p>101. Paralysis should be represented on the stage by being inactive, motionless, dispirited like an inert object, senseless, and stiff-bodied.</p>
<p>102. Perspiration should be represented on the stage by taking up a fan, wiping off sweat and looking for breeze.</p>
<p>103. Horripilation should be represented on the stage by repeated thrills, hairs standing on the end, and by touching the body.</p>
<p>104. Change of Voice should be represented by broken and choking voice, and Trembling by quivering, throbbing and shivering.</p>
<p>105. Change of Colour should be represented by alteration of colour of the face by putting pressure on the artery, and this is dependent on the limbs.</p>
<p>106. Weeping should be represented on the stage by rubbing the eyes and shedding tears, and Loss of Consciousness by inaction, motionlessness, imperceptible breathing and [finally] by falling on the ground.</p>
<h2 id="application-of-states-to-different-sentiments-rasa"><em>Application of States to different Sentiments (rasa)</em></h2>
<p>107. These are the forty-nine States of the three kinds mentioned by me. Now you ought to hear of the different Sentiments to which they are applicable.</p>
<p>108-109. All the [forty-nine] States except indolence, cruelty and disgust are applicable to the Erotic Sentiment (lit. raise the Erotic Sentiment by their own name).</p>
<p>110. Weakness, apprehension, envy, weariness, inconstancy, dreaming, sleeping and dissimulation are the States applicable to the Comic Sentiment.</p>
<p>111. Discouragement, anxiety, depression, weariness, weeping, stupor and death are the States applicable to the Pathetic Sentiment.</p>
<p>112. Arrogance, envy, energy, agitation, intoxication, anger, inconstancy and cruelty are the States applicable to the Furious Sentiment.</p>
<p>113-114, Presence of mind, energy, agitation, joy, assurance, cruelty, indignation, intoxication, horripilation, change of voice, anger, envy, contentment, arrogance and deliberation are the States applicable to the Heroic Sentiment.</p>
<p>115. Perspitation, trembling, horripilation, choking voice, fear, death, change of colour are the States applicable to the Terrible Sentiment.</p>
<p>116. Epilepsy, insanity, despair, intoxication, death, sickness and fear, are the States applicable to the Odious Sentiment.</p>
<p>117. Paralysis, perspiration, loss of consciousness, horripilation, astonishment, agitation, stupor, joy and fainting are the States applicable to the Marvellous Sentiment.</p>
<p>118. These Sāttvika States which depend on the various kinds of Histrionic Representation are included into all the Sentiments by experts in the production of plays.</p>
<p>119-1120. No play in its production can have one Sentiment only. If in an assemblage of the many States, Sentiments, Styles (<em>vṛtti</em>) and Local Usages (<em>pravṛtti</em>) [in the production of a play] any one item has varied representation, it should be considered the Dominant Sentiment and the rest the Transitory ones.</p>
<p>121. That which stands on the principal theme [of the play] and is combined with Determinants, Consequents and Transitory States is the Dominant Sentiment.</p>
<p>122.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>This Dominant Sentiment should be represented with an exuberence of the Sattva, but the Transitory States by mere physical gestures (lit. form), for they are to support the Dominant Sentiment [and as such should not excel it].</p>
<p>123. [Independent representation of] a variety [of Sentiments] does not displease and such a variety is rare in practical life (lit. amongst people). But a mixture of different Sentiments will, however, bring pleasure [to the spectators] when such is carefully represented.</p>
<p>124. In [the production of] plays the Dominant, the Sāttvika and the Transitory States which are supporters of the Sentiments and which are accomplished through many objects and ideas, should be assigned to male<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> characters.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>
<p>125. The Sentiments and the States in plays are thus to be created. One who knows this well will attain the best Success [in the production of a play].</p>
<p>Here ends Chapter VII of Bharata’s Nāṭyaśāstra, which treats of the Representation of the States.</p>
