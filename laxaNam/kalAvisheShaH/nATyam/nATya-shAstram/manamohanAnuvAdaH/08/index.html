  <h2 id="the-sages-question"><em>The sages question</em>.</h2>
<p>1-2. Through your kindness we have heard in due order everything relating to the origin of the States<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and Sentiments<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. We shall now like to know also what the experts say about the different kinds of Histrionic Representation, their meanings and different subdivisions.</p>
<p>3. O the blessed one, you are also to tell us accurately what kinds of Histrionic Representation are to be applied to which [places or occasions] by persons aiming at Success.</p>
<h2 id="bharata-answers"><em>Bharata answers</em>.</h2>
<p>4. On these words of the sages, Bharata spoke thus relating to the four kinds of Histrionic Representation.</p>
<p>5. “O sages, I shall now speak to you in detail so that the Histrionic Representation becomes properly explained to you.</p>
<p><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> We shall speak of [the fact that] the <em>abhinaya</em> (Histrionic Representation) is of four kinds. The question is, “Why is it called the <em>abhinaya?</em>” It is said in reply to this that the <em>abhinaya</em> is derived from the prefix <em>abhi</em>, and the verbal root <em>nī</em> meaning ‘to cause to get’ (to attain), and the sufix <em>ac</em> attached to these two. Hence a [full] answer to this should be made after a consideration of the root and its meaning.</p>
<p>There is a Śloka on this point</p>
<p>6. As the root <em>nī</em> preceded by <em>abhi</em> means ‘carrying the performances (<em>prayoga</em>) of a play [to the point of direct] ascertainment of its meaning,’ so [the word made out of them] becomes <em>abhinaya</em> (carrying towards).</p>
<h2 id="meaning-of-abhinaya"><em>Meaning of abhinaya</em></h2>
<p>7. <em>Abhinaya</em> is so called because in the performance [of a play] it together with the Śākha<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, the Aṅga<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> and the Upāṅga<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> explains the meaning of different [things].</p>
<h2 id="four-kinds-of-abhinaya"><em>Four kinds of abhinaya</em></h2>
<p>8. O Brahmins, the Histrionic Representation of a play takes place in four ways, and on this [Representation] the plays of different types rest.</p>
<p>9. O Brahmins, this Histrionic Representation is known to be fourfold: Gestures<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> (<em>āṅgika</em>), Words, (<em>vācika</em>) Dresses and Make-up (<em>āhārya</em>) and the Sattva.</p>
<h2 id="gesture-āṅgika-its-three-varieties"><em>Gesture (āṅgika): its three varieties</em></h2>
<p>10. Of these, the Sattva has been described before<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>, along with the States; now listen first of all above the Gestures.</p>
<p>11. The Gesture is of three kinds, viz. that of the limbs (<em>śārira</em>), that of the face (<em>mukhaja</em>) and that related to [different], movements of the entire body (<em>ceṣṭākṛta</em>) including the Śākhā, the Aṅga and the Upāṅga.</p>
<p>12. Dramatic performance in its entirety relates to the six limbs including the major and the minor ones, such as head, hands, lips, breast, sides and feet.</p>
<p>13. The six major limbs (<em>aṅga</em>) are head, hands, breast, sides, waist and feet, and the (six) minor limbs (<em>upāṅga</em>) are eyes, eyebrows, nose, lower lip and chin.</p>
<p>14. Producers of plays should reckon the Śākhā, dance (<em>nṛtta</em>) and the Aṅkura as the three aspects of the Histrionic Representation.</p>
<p>15. The Gestures are called the Śākhā;<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> pantomiming through them is the Aṅkura<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> and that which is based on the Karaṇas<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> and consists of the Aṅgahāras<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> is called dance (<em>nṛtta</em>).</p>
<p>16. O Brahmins, listen first of all about the different gestures of the head, which are included in the facial gestures and which support many Sentiments (<em>rasa</em>) and States (<em>bhāva</em>).</p>
<h2 id="gestures-of-the-head-śiras-and-their-uses"><em>Gestures of the head (śiras) and their uses</em></h2>
<p>17-18. The gesture of the head is of thirteen<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> kinds, viz. Ākampita, Kampita, Dhuta, Vidhuta, Parivāhita, Udvāhita, Avadhuta, Añcita, Nihañcita, Parāvṛtta, Utkṣipta, Adhogata, and Lolita.</p>

<p>36. Besides these there are many other gestures of the head, which are based on popular acting. These are to be used according to the popular practice (lit. nature).</p>
<p>37. I have spoken about the thirteen gestures of the head. Now I shall discuss the characteristics of the Glances.</p>
<h2 id="thirty-six-glances-dṛṣṭi"><em>Thirty-six Glances (dṛṣṭi)</em></h2>
<p>38. Glances expressing the Sentiments<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> are Kāntā, Bhayānakā, Hāsyā, Karuṇā, Adbhutā, Raudrī, Vīrā, and Bībhatsā.</p>

<h3 id="glances-to-express-the-sentiments"><em>Glances to express the Sentiments</em></h3>
<p>43. I shall now explain the characteristics of these Glances in connexion with the various Sentiments and the States, and shall describe their functions.</p>

<h3 id="glances-to-express-dominant-states"><em>Glances to express Dominant States</em></h3>
<p>52. Glances defined here are known to occur in relation to the Sentiments. I shall now explain the Glances relating to the Dominant States.</p>
<p>53. Snigdhā: The Glance which is not much widened (lit. medium widened), is sweet, and in which eyeballs are still, and there are tears of joy, is called Snigdhā (loving); it is used in love (lit. grows out of love).</p>

<h3 id="additional-glances"><em>Additional Glances</em></h3>
<p>103-107. I shall speak about the varieties of Glance in special relation of these (lit. there). These are of eight kinds, viz. Sama (level), Sācī (sidelong), Anuvṛtta (inspecting), Ālokita (casual), Vilokita (looking round), Pralokita (carefully looking), Ullokita (looking up), and Avalokita (looking down).</p>

<p>149-156. Gestures of the mouth are: Vidhuta, Vinivṛtta, Nirbhugna, Bhugna, Vivṛta and Udvāhī.</p>
<p>Vidhuta—the obliquely open (mouth).<br>

<h2 id="colour-of-the-face-mukharāga"><em>Colour of the face (mukharāga)</em></h2>
<p>157-158. The colour of the face according to the circumstances (lit. meaning) is of four kinds: natural (<em>svābhāvika</em>) bright (<em>prasanna</em>), reddened (<em>rakta</em>) and dark (<em>śyāma</em>).</p>
<h3 id="uses-of-the-colour-of-the-face"><em>Uses of the colour of the face</em>.</h3>
<p>159-160. Natural face—in a natural and indifferent (mood).<br>
Bright face—in wonder, laughter and love.<br>
Reddened face—in intoxication and in the Heroic, the Terrible and the Pathetic Sentiments.<br>
Dark face—in the Terrible and the Odious Sentiments.</p>
<p>161-162. The colour of the face should be thus used to represent the States and the Sentiments. The acting done with the Gestures of the Śākhā<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>, the Aṅga and the Upāṅga is good, but without proper colour of the face it will not be charming (lit. beautiful).</p>
<p>162-163. Even a few Gestures when combined with the proper colour of the face will double their charm (lit. beauty) just as the moon will enhance the charm of the night.</p>
<p>163-164. Glances too when combined with the proper colour of the face will clearly express the different States and the Sentiments, and on this (<em>i.e</em>. the colour of the face) the Histrionic Representation rests.</p>
<p>164-165. The colour of the face suitable to the representation of the States and the Sentiments, should follow every gestures of the eye (Glance), the eyebrow and the mouth. So much about the colour of the face which is the basis of the States and the Sentiments.</p>
<h2 id="neck-grīvā"><em>Neck (grīvā)</em></h2>
<p>166-167. I shall now tell you, O Brahmins, about the gestures of the neck. They are of nine kinds: Samā, Natā, Unnatā, Tryasrā, Recitā, Kuñcitā, Añcita, Valitā, and Nivṛttā.</p>
<h3 id="description-and-uses-of-neck-gestures"><em>Description and uses of neck gestures</em></h3>
<p>167-171. Samā—the natural neck. (Uses): in meditation, natural pose, and muttering of <em>mantras</em>.<br>

<p>172-173. These are the many varieties of the neck gestures according to their [expressing different] customary states of men. Gestures of the neck are all to follow the gestures of the head, and the head gestures also are reflected in those of the neck. So much about the description of the gestures of the head and the connected minor limbs (<em>upāṅga</em>) and their uses. Now listen about the gestures of the remaining limbs (<em>aṅga</em>), which I am going to describe.</p>
<p>Here ends Chapter VIII of Bharata’s Nāṭyaśāstra, which treats of the Gestures of Minor Limbs.</p>

<p>The AD. has only eight glances, see ed. M. Ghosh, 66-78, and A. K. Coomaraswamy, MG. p. 40. But curiously enough the names of the eight glances in the AD. even if referred by Coomaraswamy’s text to the Bharataśāstra, does not occur in the NŚ. which has no less than thirty-six glances. Besides the eight glances Coomaraswamy’s text records (loc. cit.) forty-four glances which include those mentioned in the NŚ.&#160;<a href="#fnref:21" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
