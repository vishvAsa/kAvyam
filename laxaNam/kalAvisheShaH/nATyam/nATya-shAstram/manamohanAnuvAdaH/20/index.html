  <h2 id="introduction"><em>Introduction</em></h2>
<p>1. I shall now describe the division of plays into ten classes<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> with their names, functions and modes of production.</p>
<p>2-3. For defining them the plays are to be known as Nāṭaka,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Prakaraṇa, Aṅka<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> (Utsṛṣṭikāṅka), Vyāyoga, Bhāṇa, Samavakāra, Vīthi, Prahasana, Ḍima, and Īhāmṛga which is the tenth [in order]. I shall describe their characteristics in detail.</p>
<p>4. Styles (<em>vṛtti</em>)<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> are traditionally known as the constituent elements of all dramatic works (lit. poems). With respect to their production, the ten kinds of play are considered to have proceeded from these.</p>
<p>5. Just as the [musical] notes (<em>svara</em>) constitute scales (<em>grāma</em>)[^mg5] due to the Śrutis<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> together with their Jātis<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>, so the [Varieties] of plays (lit. poetical works) come into existence due to Varieties of Styles.</p>
<p>6. Just as the Ṣaḍja<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> and the Madhyama<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> scales include all the notes, so these two [kinds of] dramatic composition (Nāṭaka and Prakaraṇa) are made up of all the Styles.</p>
<p>7. The Nāṭaka and the Prakaraṇa are to be known as made up of all the Styles, and they include varieties of situation.</p>
<p>8-9. The Bhāṇa, the Samavakāra, the Vīthi, the Īhāmṛga, the Utsṛṣṭikāṅka (Aṅka), the Vyāyoga, the Ḍima, and the Prahasana should not include the Graceful Style. I shall describe hereafter the different methods of constructing plays.</p>
<h2 id="the-nāṭaka"><em>The Nāṭaka</em></h2>
<p>10-11. [The play] which has for its subject-matter a well-known story,<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> for its Hero a celebrated person of exalted nature<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> and which describes the character of a person born in the line of royal seers,<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> divine protection [for him], his many superhuman powers,<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> and exploits such as, success [in different undertakings], and amorous pastimes, and which has suitable number of Acts (<em>aṅka</em>)<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> and Introductory Scenes (<em>prāveśaka</em>)<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> is called a Nāṭaka.</p>
<p>12. Behaviour of kings due to their joys and sorrows, when revealed by means of acts expressing in varied ways the Psychological States carrying many Sentiments, is styled a Nāṭaka.</p>
<h3 id="the-act"><em>The Act</em></h3>
<p>13. An expert should properly make an Aṅka containing changed conditions [of the Hero] and restricting it to the mere transmission of the Vital Drop (<em>bindu</em>).</p>
<p>14. The Aṅka is the customary word. As by means of presentation of the Psychological States and Sentiments, it causes the purposes of the play to develop, and as it adheres to some technical rules [for this purpose] it is called an Aṅka<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> (Act).</p>
<p>15. An Act should be brought to a close by (lit. in) a division of the play, and no final disposal of the Seed (<em>bīja</em>) should be made in it. And the Vital Drop (<em>bindu</em>)<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> of (lit. arising from) the play should again and again be made to occur in the plot (<em>vastu</em>).</p>
<p>16.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> That [part of the play] where a [particular] incident, is fully expressed, but where the Seed is not finally disposed of, is always to be known as an Act which slightly clings to the Vital Drop (<em>bindu</em>).</p>
<p>17. An Act which relates to the direct exploits of the persons mentioned before (i.e. the Heroes) and their various conditions, should not be made too long.</p>
<p>18. It should also be known that an Act is to contain more Sentiments than one, arising from [words and deeds of] of the Hero, his queen,<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> and their superiors,<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> priest, minister and leader of the caravan (<em>sārthavāha</em>).<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup></p>
<p>19. Pacification of anger, grief, pronouncing a curse, terrified flight, marriage ceremony, commencement of any miracle and its actual occurrence, should not be made visible in an Act.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup></p>
<p>20. A battle, loss of a kingdom, death, and siege of a city not being presentable in an Act<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> should be referred to by means of Introductory Scenes.</p>
<p>21. In an Act or in an Introductory Scene of the Nāṭaka or the Prakaraṇa, there should be no killing of a person who is known as the Hero.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup></p>
<p>22. His flight, or capture or treaty [with the enemy] should be brought about, and these should be indicated in the Introductory Scenes by referring to relevant actions.</p>
<p>23.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> An Act should cover events that can take place in course of a single day. And it should relate to the Seed of the play and should proceed without a clash with the routine duties.</p>
<p>24. A wise play-wright should not put in [too] many events in a single Act.<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> Events in it should be depicted without a hindrance to routine duties.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup></p>
<p>23. Persons appearing on the stage during an Act (lit. there) would go out after performing things connected with the Seed and the purpose of the play, and should lead to relevant Sentiments.</p>
<p>26. Knowing the length <em>of</em> a day which is divided into Kṣaṇas, Yāmas and Muhūrtas, one should distribute exhaustively the entire action in different Acts.</p>
<h3 id="introductory-scene"><em>Introductory Scene</em></h3>
<p>27. When events that are to be finished in course of a day cannot be accommodated in an Act, these should be presented in an Introductory Scene after closing the [same] Act.</p>
<p>28. By closing the Act [in which they begin<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup> events requiring a month, or a year but never more than that<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> for their happening, are also be presented similarly.</p>
<p>29. When in an Act any person starts on business on a long journey, it should be brought to a close [at that point] as prescribed before.</p>
<p>30. With an Act of the Nāṭaka and the Prakaraṇa the Hero should be closely associated. And an Introductory Scene should be made up of a conversation of attendants.</p>
<p>31. In plays so for as they relate to the Nātaka and the Prakaraṇa, an Introductory Scene coming between two Acts will refer briefly to the [next] Segments.</p>
<p>32. It (the Introductory Scene) should not consist of exploits of the superior and the middling characters, and there should be no exalted speech in it. And in practice it should adopt speeches and manners of the common people.</p>
<p>33. An Introductory Scene may have many purposes.</p>
<p>[For example], it may explain the advent of time, change of purpose, or the inversion of movement, or making a beginning [of some event].</p>
<p>34. Events which depend on many [persons] are to be compressed in Segments by means of Introductory Scenes. For a play containing [too] many prose passages<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> will be tiresome [to the spectators] at [the time of] the production [of a play].</p>
<p>35. When a particular item cannot be completely presented in an Act, lest it should be too large for [successful] production, its account should be compressed in a few words and put in an introductory Scene.</p>
<h3 id="the-supporting-scene"><em>The Supporting Scene</em></h3>
<p>36. In the Nāṭaka the Supporting Scene (<em>viṣkambhaka</em>) should always be made up with the middling characters<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup> and it should be concise, and adopt Sanskritic speech.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup></p>
<p>37. It should be of two kinds: pure (<em>śuddha</em>) and mixed (<em>saṃkīrṇa</em>). Of these, the pure is made up with the middling characters [only]<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>, and the mixed with the inferior and the middling characters.<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup></p>
<p>38. In the Nāṭaka and the Prakaraṇa Supporting Scene between two Acts or at the beginning of an Act, should always include the middling and the inferior characters.</p>
<h3 id="number-of-dramatic-personae"><em>Number of dramatic personae</em></h3>
<p>39. The Nāṭaka and the Prakaraṇa should not be made to contain a great number of attendants [to the Hero]. The Hero’s attendants (lit. men of work) in such plays (lit. there) should [at most] be four or five.<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup></p>
<p>40. Plays of the Vyāyoga, the Īhāmṛga, the Samavakāra, and the Ḍima classes should be made to have ten or twelve Acts.<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="introducing-chariots-and-palaces-on-the-stage"><em>Introducing chariots and palaces on the stage</em></h3>
<p>41. A chariot, an elephant, a horse and a palace should not be presented on the stage. These should be provided [in a play] by means of appearance and costumes [of men related to them] and [their] Gaits<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup> and movements (<em>gati-vīcāra</em>).<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup></p>
<p>42. But model works of an elephant, a horse, a palace, a hill or any conveyance as well as [imitation] weapons out of cheap materials are to be made for a presentation of these by those who know the rules [for their construction].<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="introducing-an-army-on-the-stage"><em>Introducing an army on the stage</em></h3>
<p>43. If due to any reason a detatchment of an army is to be introduced on the stage (lit. here), only four or six persons are to make their appearance.</p>
<p>44. [The show should be made as consisting of a small number of men, horses, vehicles and attendants, and it should move slowly. For in the military role (<em>kṣatra</em>) [actual] rules of polity do not apply.</p>
<p>45. In the composition of a play Action should be made [like] the tip of the cow’s tail,<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup> and all the exalted situations in a play should be placed at the end.</p>
<p>46-47. At the conclusion of all the plays which contain various Psychological States and Sentiments, experts should always introduce the Marvellous Sentiment.<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup> Thus I have briefly but properly spoken about the characteristics of the Nāṭaka. I shall hereafter describe the Prakaraṇa by mentioning its characteristics.</p>
<h2 id="the-prakaraṇa"><em>The Prakaraṇa</em></h2>
<p>48. The play (lit. where) in which the writer <em>prakurute</em> (devises) by his own intellect an original plot with its Hero, and works up its elaboration (<em>śarīra</em>), is called the Prakaraṇa.</p>
<p>49. When a playwright constructs a play of marvellous qualities with an original (lit. invented) Seed, and a Hero not coming out of Ṛṣi’s works to carry on the action the same is also called the Prakaraṇa.<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup></p>
<p>50. The plot and its elaboration as the basis of the Sentiments, which have been prescribed in case of the Nāṭaka are also to be applied to the Prakaraṇa. Only its plot should be newly created.</p>
<p>51. The varied exploits<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup> of Brahmins, merchants, ministers, priests, officers [of the king] and leaders of caravan [when presented in a play] are to be known as the Prakaraṇa.<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup></p>
<p>52. The Prakaraṇa should be known as not made up with an exalted Hero. And it does not contain the character of any god, has no story of king’s enjoyment [of pleasures], and it is connected with the men outside [the royal palace].</p>
<p>53. The play of the Prakaraṇa type should include [in some cases] slaves, Viṭa<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup> and head of the bankers’ guild [as characters and should contain incidents arising from] the attendance of courtezans as well as exploits of depraved women of good family.<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup></p>
<p>54. [In an Act of the Prakaraṇa] where a minister, head of bankers’ guild, Brahmin, priest, minister and leader of caravans stay in their family circle, no courtezan should be brought in there.<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup></p>
<p>55. [In the Prakaraṇa] when a person is in the company of a courtezan, there should not be [at the same time] his meeting with any respectable woman (lit. woman of good family), and while he is with a woman of high family no courtezan should meet him then.</p>
<p>56. If out of necessity (lit. reason) there occurs a meeting<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup> of courtezans and respectable ladies in [any scene of] a Prakaraṇa, their language and manners should be kept undistorted.</p>
<p>57. In the Nāṭaka and the Prakaraṇa the playwrights should have the number of Acts as not less than five and more than ten; and this should be furnished with the various Sentiments and the Psychological States.</p>
<p>58. After considering the need and action of the plot one should place between two Acts the Introductory Scenes which are to compress the events in the Segments (<em>sandhi</em>)<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="the-nāṭikā"><em>The Nāṭikā</em></h2>
<p>59. In a play of the Nāṭikā (Nāṭī) class, producers are to recognise a more or less well-known variety of these two (the Nāṭaka and the Prakaraṇa).<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup></p>
<p>60. Different in origin from the two [types of plays] the Nāṭaka and the Prakaraṇa, its plot should be invented, the Hero should be a king, and it should be based on [an incident relating to] music or affairs of the harem.<sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup></p>
<p>61. And it contains an abundance of female characters, has four Acts, graceful gestures as its soul; well-arranged constituents, many dances, songs and recitations, and love’s enjoyment are its chief features.<sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup></p>
<p>62. The Nāṭikā should be known also to contain [a display of] royal manners, [a fit of] anger and its pacification, and to have the Hero, His queen, the female Messenger and the attendants [as its <em>dramatis personae</em> ].</p>
<p>63.<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup> The characteristics of the Nāṭaka and the Prakaraṇa have been briefly described by me. I shall now speak about the characteristics of the Samavakāra.<sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="the-samavakāra"><em>The Samavakāra</em></h2>
<p>64-65. It<sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup> should have the [exploits of] gods and Asuras as its subject matter and one of them as its well-known and exalted Hero, and it is to consist of three Acts [presenting] the three kinds of deception, the three kinds of excitement or the three kinds of love.<sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup> [Besides this] it should have as many as twelve <em>dramatis personae</em> and require a duration (lit. length) of eighteen Nāḍikās<sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup> [for its performance]. I shall now speak about the rule regarding the number of Nāḍikās to be alloted to the different Acts.</p>
<p>66. A Nāḍikā<sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup> should be known as the half of the Muhūrta<sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup> which is a [well-known] measure of time. The Acts in a Samavakāra should be measured according to the directions given in terms of this Nāḍikā.</p>
<h3 id="the-first-act-of-the-samavakāra"><em>The first act of the Samavakāra</em></h3>
<p>67. The first Act [of the Samavakāra] should have a duration of twelve Nāḍikās<sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup> and it is to contain laughter, excitement, deception or a Vīthi.<sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="the-second-and-the-third-acts-of-the-samavakāra"><em>The second and the third acts of the Samavakāra</em></h3>
<p>68. The second Act also should be similar [except that] it is to have a duration of four Nāḍikās.<sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup> And the third Act, as enjoined in the rule about the length of the plot will have a duration of two Nāḍikās<sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup> only.</p>
<p>69.<sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup> In composing such a play the different Acts should be made to have different topics. And topics in the Samavakāra are to be loosely related to one another.<sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="three-kinds-of-excitement"><em>Three kinds of Excitement</em></h3>
<p>70. Excitement (<em>vidrava</em>) is known to be of three kinds, such as being due to battle, flood (lit. water), storm (lit. wind) and fire, or to a big elephant at large, or the siege of a city.</p>
<h3 id="three-kinds-of-deception"><em>Three kinds of Deception</em></h3>
<p>71. Deception (<em>kapaṭa</em>) is known to be of three kinds, such as being due to a devised plan, accident or that [practised] by the enemy. It creates joy or sorrow [to persons].</p>
<h3 id="three-kinds-of-love"><em>Three kinds of Love</em></h3>
<p>72. In this connexion (lit here) three kinds of love to be presented through different actions are: that in relation to duty (<em>dharma</em>), that actuated by material gain (<em>artha</em>) and that actuated by passion (<em>kāma</em>).</p>
<h3 id="love-together-with-duty"><em>Love together with duty</em></h3>
<p>73. When in [sticking to] the duty one’s [much] desired well-being is accomplished in many ways, by regular austerities it is to be known as love in relation to duty (<em>dharma-śṛṅgāra</em>).</p>
<h3 id="love-together-with-material-gain"><em>Love together with material gain</em></h3>
<p>74. Love for money according to its meaning is of various kinds, due to a desire for money. In it one shows a simulated passion in the matter of intercourse with a woman.</p>
<h3 id="love-due-to-passion"><em>Love due to passion</em></h3>
<p>75. Love actuated by passion (<em>kāma-śṛṅgāra</em>) includes the seduction of a maiden and also gentle or excited love-affair of a man with a woman.</p>
<h3 id="metres-not-allowed-in-the-samavakāra"><em>Metres not allowed in the Samavakāra</em></h3>
<p>76.<sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup> In the Samavakāra the playwright should make proper use of metres other than Uṣṇik and Gāyatrī etc., which are of complex construction.<sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup></p>
<p>77. In this manner an expert should compose a Samavakāra which will deal with joys and sorrows. I shall hereafter speak about the characteristics of the Īhāmṛga.</p>
<h2 id="the-īhāmṛga"><em>The Īhāmṛga</em></h2>
<p>78. It (Īhāmṛga) has as its <em>dramatis personae</em> divine males who are implicated in fights about divine females. It should be constructed with a well-arranged plot and should be convincing.<sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup></p>
<p>79. It is to abound in vehement (<em>uddhata</em>) Heroes and to have its construction dependent on feminine anger which is to give rise to commotion (<em>saṃkṣobha</em>) excitement (<em>vidrava</em>) and angry conflict (<em>saṃpheṭa</em>).</p>
<p>80. The Īhāmṛga should be a play with well-ordered construction in which the plot of love is to be based on causing discord among females, carrying them off and oppressing [the enemies].</p>
<p>81. All that are to be made [available] in the Vyāyoga—its male characters, Styles and Sentiments—should be brought in the Īhāmṛga also, except that the latter is to include (lit. have connexion with), the goddesses (lit. divine females) only as its female characters.<sup id="fnref:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">68</a></sup></p>
<p>82. [In the Īhāmṛga] when persons intent on killing are on the point of killing, [the impending] battle should be avoided on some pretext.</p>
<p>83. The characteristics of the Īhāmṛga have been briefly mentioned by me. I shall speak hereafter on the characteristics of the Dima.</p>
<h2 id="the-ḍima"><em>The Ḍima</em></h2>
<p>84. The Ḍima should be constructed with a well-known plot, and its Hero should be well-known and of the exalted (<em>udātta</em>) type. It is to contain the six Sentiments and to consist of four Acts only<sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup>.</p>
<p>85-86. It should contain all the Sentiments except the Erotic and the Comic, a plot (<em>kāvyayoni</em>) with exciting Sentiments and various Psychological States, and it is [also] to include incidents such as an earthquake, fall of meteors, an eclipse of the sun or of the moon, fighting in battle and personal combat, and angry conflict.</p>
<p>87-88. The Dima should should abound in deceit and jugglery, and should include energetic activity of many persons, and dissention (<em>bheda</em>) among themselves, and it is to include sixteen characters which may be gods, Asuras Rākṣasas, Bhūtas, Yakṣas and Nāgas, and [besides this] the play is to be carefully made in the Grand and the Energetic Styles and is to have many Psychological States to support it.</p>
<p>89. The Ḍima has been described by me in all its characteristics. I shall speak now about the characteristics of the Vyāyoga.</p>
<h2 id="the-vyāyoga"><em>The Vyāyoga</em></h2>
<p>90. The Vyāyoga should be constructed by experts with one well-known Hero as its basis, and it should include a small number of female characters and [the events related in it] will be of one day’s duration only<sup id="fnref:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup>.</p>
<p>91. Many males are to take part in the Samavakāra, but it is not to have the latter’s length, for it is to have only one Act.</p>
<p>92-93. It should have a royal sage as its Hero and not a divine personage, and it should include battle, personal combat, challenge and angry conflict. Thus the Vyāyoga should be made with exciting Sentiments as its basis. I shall now speak of the characteristics of the Utsṛṣṭikâṅka (Aṅka).</p>
<h2 id="the-aṅka-utsṛṣṭikāṅka"><em>The Aṅka (Utsṛṣṭikāṅka)</em></h2>
<p>94. The plot in it is [usually to be] well-known, but it may sometimes be otherwise, and it is to be furnished with male characters other than those who are divine.<sup id="fnref:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">71</a></sup></p>
<p>95-96. The Utsṛṣṭikāṅka should abound in the Pathetic Sentiment; it will treat women’s lamentations and despondent utterances at a time when battle and violent fighting has ceased; it should include bewildered movements [of mourners], and it must be devoid of the Grand, the Energetic and the Graceful Styles, and its plot should relate to one’s fall (lit. end of the rise).</p>
<h3 id="scenes-with-celestial-heroes"><em>Scenes with celestial Heroes</em></h3>
<p>97. [Scenes of] all the plays which have celestial Heroes, and which [treat] a battle, capture and killing [of enemies], should be laid in Bhārata-varṣa.</p>
<p>98. Why, of all the <em>varṣas</em> (sub-continents) created by the gods, is Bhārata-varṣa chosen [in this connexion]? Because the entire land here is charming, sweet-smelling and of golden colour.</p>
<p>99-100. [But scenes of their] garden party (lit. going to a garden), sports, pastimes, and enjoying the company of females, are always to be laid in these <em>varṣas</em>; for there is neither any sorrow nor any grief there. Their enjoyments should take place in the mountains which are connected with those <em>varṣas</em> in the Purāṇic accounts, but their [other] deeds should begin here (<em>i.e</em>. in Bhārata-varṣa).</p>
<p>101. The characteristics of an Utsṛṣṭikāṅka (Aṅka) have been exhaustively explained by me, I shall now speak of the Prahasana with its characteristics.</p>
<h2 id="the-prahasana"><em>The Prahasana</em></h2>
<p>102. The Prahasana should be known to be of two kinds: pure and mixed. I shall separately treat their characteristics.<sup id="fnref:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">72</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="the-pure-prahasana"><em>The pure Prahasana</em></h3>
<p>103-104. The Prahasana is known as pure (<em>śuddha</em>) when it contains comic disputations by Śaiva gurus (<em>bhagavat</em>)<sup id="fnref:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">73</a></sup> ascetics, Bhikṣus, Śrotriya Brahmins, and others, and abounds in jocular remarks by persons of low class; and all this gives uniformly to the Plot a realistic picture of the language<sup id="fnref:74"><a href="#fn:74" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">74</a></sup> and the conduct of all these, in passages describing their special Psychological States.</p>
<h3 id="the-mixed-prahasana"><em>The mixed Prahasana</em></h3>
<p>105. That Prahasana is called mixed<sup id="fnref:75"><a href="#fn:75" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">75</a></sup> in which courtezans, servants, eunuchs, Viṭas and Dhūrtas and unchaste women appear with their immodest appearance, dress and movements.</p>
<p>106-107. Some popular topic [of scandal] or incident of hypocrisy should be introduced in the Prahasana through the disputations of Dhūrtas<sup id="fnref:76"><a href="#fn:76" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">76</a></sup> and Viṭas. The Prahasana should include [any of] the types of theVīthi it may properly require.<sup id="fnref:77"><a href="#fn:77" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">77</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="the-bhāṇa"><em>The Bhāṇa</em></h2>
<p>107-108.<sup id="fnref:78"><a href="#fn:78" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">78</a></sup> I shall now speak of the characteristics of the Bhāṇa. The Bhāṇa is to be acted by a single character, and it is of two kinds: that [with one’s] recounting of one’s own feelings, and that [with] describing someone else’s acts.</p>
<p>109. [The Bhāṇa which is to include] somebody else’s words addressed to oneself, should be acted by means of replies in course of conversations with an imaginary person (<em>ākāśa-bhāṣita</em>) along with the [suitable] movements of the limbs.</p>
<p>110. The Bhāṇa should include characters of Dhūrtas and Viṭas and treat their different conditions, and it is always to consist of one Act, and should include many incidents which are to be acted by a Dhūrta or a Viṭa.</p>
<p>111. All the characteristics of the Bhāṇa have been described by me according to the tradition (<em>āgama</em>). I shall [now] speak of the characteristics of the Vīthi in due order.</p>
<h2 id="the-vīthi"><em>The Vīthi</em></h2>
<p>112-113. The Vīthi should have one Act and is to be acted by two persons or one. And it is to include characters of the superior, the middling or the inferior type, and it may contain [any of] the Sentiments, and it may be the thirteen types. I shall now speak of the characteristics of all these.</p>
<h3 id="thirteen-types-of-the-vīthi"><em>Thirteen types of the Vīthi</em></h3>
<p>114-115. The thirteen types<sup id="fnref:79"><a href="#fn:79" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">79</a></sup> of the Vīthi are: Accidental Interpretation (<em>udghātyaka</em>), Transference (<em>avalagita</em>), Ominous Significance (<em>avaspandita</em>), Incoherent Chatter (<em>asat-pralāpa</em>), Compliment (<em>prapañca</em>), Enigma (<em>nāli=nālikā</em>) Repartee (<em>vākkeli</em>), Outvying (<em>adhivala</em>), Deception (<em>chala</em>), Declaration (<em>vyāhāra</em>), Crushing (<em>mṛdava</em>), Three Men’s Talk (<em>trigata</em>), and Undue Combination of Words (<em>gaṇḍa</em>).</p>
<p>116. [Any of these] thirteen types is always to be attached to the Vīthi. I shall now speak of their characteristics in due order.</p>
<h3 id="accidental-interpretation"><em>Accidental Interpretation</em></h3>
<p>117. If, in order to explain them, men connect words of obscure meaning with words other than [those intended by the speaker] it becomes Accidental Interpretation.<sup id="fnref:80"><a href="#fn:80" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">80</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="transference"><em>Transference</em></h3>
<p>118. When [anything] occurring in [relation to] some thing, will be made to accomplish something else, it becomes [an instance of] Transference (<em>avalagita</em>).<sup id="fnref:81"><a href="#fn:81" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">81</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="ominous-significance"><em>Ominous Significance</em></h3>
<p>119. That, one attaches (lit. creates) out of misunderstanding an auspicious or inauspicious meaning (lit. auspicious or inauspicious rise) to the words (lit. meaning) mentioned, is [an instance of] Ominous Significance (<em>avaspandita</em>).<sup id="fnref:82"><a href="#fn:82" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">82</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="incoherent-chatter"><em>Incoherent Chatter</em></h3>
<p>120. When an irrelevant question (lit. sentence) is followed by [an equally] irrelevant answer, it is [an instance of] Incoherent Chatter (<em>asat-pralāpa</em>).<sup id="fnref:83"><a href="#fn:83" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">83</a></sup></p>
<p>121. When to a foolish person a learned man speaks the right words, but his words are not listened to, it is [an instance of] Incoherent Chatter.<sup id="fnref:84"><a href="#fn:84" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">84</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="compliment"><em>Compliment</em></h3>
<p>122. When comic and untrue words purporting to be mutual praise of two persons, are uttered in the interest of one [of them] it is [an instance of] Compliment (<em>prapañca</em>).<sup id="fnref:85"><a href="#fn:85" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">85</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="enigma-and-repartee"><em>Enigma and Repartee</em></h3>
<p>123. An enigmatical remark that gives rise to laughter (lit. followed by laughter) is called an Enigma (<em>nālikā</em>)<sup id="fnref:86"><a href="#fn:86" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">86</a></sup> Repartee (<em>vākkeli</em>) arises from a single or twofold reply.<sup id="fnref:87"><a href="#fn:87" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">87</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="outvying"><em>Outvying</em></h3>
<p>124. When somebody else’s words and those of one’s ownself, in course of a dialogue, lead to their mutual modification, it is [an instance of] Outvying (<em>adhivala</em>).<sup id="fnref:88"><a href="#fn:88" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">88</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="deception"><em>Deception</em></h3>
<p>125. When after alluring one by replies, something opposite is done through those very replies being considered meaningless, it is [an instance of] Deception (<em>chala</em>).<sup id="fnref:89"><a href="#fn:89" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">89</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="declaration"><em>Declaration</em></h3>
<p>126. If anything [liable to occur] is described vividly in the presence of the Hero and is similarly made to happen [there] without any fear, it is [an instance of] Declaration (<em>vyāhāra</em>).<sup id="fnref:90"><a href="#fn:90" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">90</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="crushing"><em>Crushing</em></h3>
<p>127. That due to an altercation one represents [another’s] merits as dements by [showing] cause [for it] and <em>vice versa</em>, is called Crushing (<em>mṛdava</em>).<sup id="fnref:91"><a href="#fn:91" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">91</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="three-mens-talk"><em>Three Men’s Talk</em></h3>
<p>128. When exalted words with the Comic Sentiment are shared by three [characters] it should be known as Three Men’s Talk (<em>trigata</em>).<sup id="fnref:92"><a href="#fn:92" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">92</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="undue-combination-of-words"><em>Undue Combination of Words</em></h3>
<p>129. Undue Combination of Words (<em>gaṇḍa</em>) according to the wise, occurs due to excitement, confusion, quarrel, reviling and many people’s abusive words.<sup id="fnref:93"><a href="#fn:93" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">93</a></sup></p>
<p>130-131. If in a play any of these thirteen types with clear meanings, occur and they possess all the characters, Sentiments and Psychological States prescribed for them by the Śāstra, it is called the Vīthi. It may be acted by one or two persons.</p>
<h2 id="the-lāsya95"><em>The Lāsya</em><sup id="fnref:94"><a href="#fn:94" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">94</a></sup></h2>
<p>132. [Similar] other limbs are attached to the Nāṭaka in connexion with the performance of the Lāsya,<sup id="fnref:95"><a href="#fn:95" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">95</a></sup> and they owe their origin to this (<em>i.e</em>., Nāṭaka), and are to be acted like the Bhāṇa by a single person.</p>
<p>133. The Lāsya Has a form similar that of the Bhāṇa, and it is to be acted by one person.<sup id="fnref:96"><a href="#fn:96" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">96</a></sup> Its action is to be imaginary like that of the Prakaraṇa and should relate to many Psychological States.</p>
<h3 id="twelve-types-of-the-lāsya"><em>Twelve types of the Lāsya</em></h3>
<p>134-135. The [twelve] types of the Lāsya are: Geyapada, Sthitapāṭhya, Āsīna (pāṭhya), Puṣpagaṇḍikā, Pracchedaka, Trimūḍha, Saindhava, Dvimūḍhaka, Uttamottamaka, Vicitrapada, Ukta-pratyukta and Bhāvita (Bhāva).<sup id="fnref:97"><a href="#fn:97" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">97</a></sup></p>

Two other late specimens of this kind are Kṛṣṇamiśra’s Vīra-vijaya and Kṛṣṇa Avadhūta’s Sarva-vinoda-nāṭaka (See Sten know, ID. p. 114).&#160;<a href="#fnref:67" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Bhāsa’s Madhyama. is its solitary old specimen unless Karṇa, also is to be taken as such (see ID. p. 52). Prahlādanadeva’s Pārtha-parākrama (12th cent.), Vatsarāja’s Kirātārjunīya (12th cent.) and Viśvanātha’s Saugandhikā-haraṇa etc. are very late specimens of this type. See Keith Sanskrit Dr. p. 265. Pusalker, Bhāsa. p. 203. Dūtavā., Dūtagha., Pañca, and Ūru. cannot be called Vyāyogas. Cf. Pusalker, Bhāsa, pp. 186, 187, 190, 209.

<p>Śaṅkhadhara’s Laṭaka-mela (12th century), Jyotirīśvara’s Dhūrta-samāgamā (15th century) and Jagadīśvara’s Hāsyārṇava (date uncertain), etc, are very late works (See Keith Sanskrit Dr. pp. 261-262). The Matta-vilāsa of Mahendra-vikrama-varman (620 A.C.) and the Bhagavad-ajjukīya ascribed to Baudhāyana Kavi, are fairly old specimens of the Prahasana, See Keith Sanskrit Dr. pp. 182.

<p>The word bhagavat relates primarily to a Śaiva saint. It is in this sense that the word has been used in the Prahasana named Bhagavad-ajjukīya, and this speaks for the antiquity of this work (See above 102 note). A Śaiva saint appears in the Matta-vilāsa, the Dhūrta-nartaka and the Hāsyacūḍāmaṇi. The last two Prahasanas are however late.

<p>The spelling avasyandita though accepted by SD. and DR. seems to be wrong (See Ag.). Haas translates the word as ‘Re-interpretation’ (pp. 84, 87) probably under the influence of the SD. (528). DR.

<p>Lāsyāṅgam is an one act play which requires lāsya or a gentle form of dance for its representation; for this term may be interpreted as lāsyam aṅgaṃ yasyaḥ tat (that which which has lāsya as its principal element). The ten lāsyāṅgas seem to be only so many varieties of the Lāsya.
