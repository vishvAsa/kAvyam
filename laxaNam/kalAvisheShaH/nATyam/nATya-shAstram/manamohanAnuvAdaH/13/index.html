  <p>1.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> So much about the formation of Maṇḍalas by a combination of the System of Cārīs (<em>cārī-vyāyāma</em>). I shall hereafter describe the Gaits suitable for (lit. existing in) different characters [in a play].</p>
<h2 id="entrance-of-dramatis-personae"><em>Entrance of dramatis personae</em></h2>
<p>2-3. After the Overture (Upavahana<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>) with drums and other musical instruments has been performed by observing Kalās suitable to the Mārga [adopted in it], and the Dhruvās [to be sung] at the entrance of <em>dramatis personae</em>, have commenced, and the curtain has been drawn away, the actors who are to develop Sentiments in the various items [of a play] should enter (lit. be made to enter) the stage.</p>
<h2 id="posture-for-superior-and-middling-characters-on-entrance"><em>Posture for superior and middling characters on entrance</em></h2>
<p>4-7. In case of characters of the superior and the middling types [the actor] should assume the Vaiṣṇava Sthāna, his breast being raised, Sama and Caturasra, shoulders at rest and not raised very much, the neck as graceful as that of a peacock, the shoulders eight Aṅgulas apart from the ears, the chin four Aṅgulas apart from the breast, and the two hands (the right and the left) respectively at the navel and at the left waist.</p>
<h2 id="interval-of-their-feet"><em>Interval of their feet</em></h2>
<p>8-9. [In the posture described above] the interval between the two feet [of the actor] should be two Tālas and a half. Raising of his feet will take should be according to his own measure [of the hand] four or two Tālas or one Tāla high.</p>
<p>9-10. In case of [characters such as] gods and kings these should be four Tālas high, of the middling [type of characters] two Tālas, and of women, inferior persons and those in disguise only one Tāla high.</p>
<h2 id="time-for-their-steps"><em>Time for their steps</em></h2>
<p>10-11. [And the time required for the steps should be] four or two Kalās or one Kalā only. [Steps] of the superior [characters] should take four Kalās, those of the middling type two Kalās, and those of the inferior type one Kalā only.</p>
<h2 id="tempo-of-their-gait"><em>Tempo of their Gait</em></h2>
<p>12. An expert in the theatrical art should apply three kinds of tempo (slow, medium and quick) to the Gait [of different characters] according to their nature.</p>
<p>13. The Gait of superior [characters should be] slow, that of middling [characters should have] the medium [tempo, while the steps of] inferior [characters should be] quick and copious. [Thus] should be applied the three tempos according to the spirit [of different characters].</p>
<p>14. So much about the rule regarding the timing and tempo [of steps]. O the sinless ones, listen now about the manner of taking steps [suitable to different characters].</p>
<h2 id="natural-gait"><em>Natural Gait</em></h2>
<p>15. In his natural [Gait] a superior [character] is to raise his knee up to the height of the waist and, in case of Cārīs to be used in fighting the same (<em>i.e</em>. the knee) is to be raised up to the height of the breast.</p>
<p>16-19. With graceful steps of the Pārśvakrāntā Cārī and in accompaniment of the instrumental music he should go five uniform steps, towards the corner of the stage, and then he should move in the Sūci Cārī by putting forward his left foot first and the right foot afterwards. Then turning round he should go [five similar steps] towards the second corner of [of stage] and then move in the Sūcī Cārī by putting forward his left foot first and the right foot afterwards, Next time he should [again turn round and] go towards the musical instruments. Thus completing twenty-one steps by going and turning back he should again move in the Sūcī Cārī by putting forward his left foot first and the right foot afterwards.</p>
<p>20. In an oblong stage the actor (<em>bharata</em>) should make elaborate foot-movements (lit. going and turning back by footsteps), but in square and triangular stages such movements should respectively be of the Caturasra and the Tryasra types.</p>
<p>21. When [a character] is walking along with his equals, the basis of the tempo [of his Gait] will be [according to his own rank] of four or two Kalās or one Kalā.</p>
<p>22. But when any one is walking accompanied by persons of the middling and the inferior types [the basis of the tempo of the Gait of the group] will be four and two Kalās or one Kalā<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>23. The wise actors should make the steps four Tālas wide in case of gods, Dānavas, Pannagas (Nāga), Yakṣas, kings, and Rākṣasas.</p>
<p>24. All other dwellers of the heaven<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> will have steps of medium [width]. But those among them who are majestic should have Gait similar to that of gods.</p>
<h2 id="gait-of-kings"><em>Gait of kings</em></h2>
<p>The sages question:</p>
<p>25-28. “If the kings are human beings why should they have a Gait similar to that of gods?” It is said [in reply], “Why should not the kings have Gait suitable for these (<em>i.e</em>. gods)? In drama and dance the characters [are of three kinds, viz.] divine, semi-divine (lit. divine-human) and human. Of these, the nature of gods is divine, that of the kings is semi-divine and that of the others known to people ate called human. For kings have been described in the Vedas and the <em>adhyātma</em> (Upaniṣad)<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> as being made up (lit. born) of parts of [different] gods. Hence there cannot be any fault in kings imitating gods.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>”</p>
<p>29. This is the rule of Gait in ordinary walking; but, for Gait in cases of hurry, insanity and anger the rule about its measure will not apply.</p>
<h2 id="gait-under-special-conditions"><em>Gait under special conditions</em></h2>
<p>30. [In those cases] producers of plays are to apply to all different characters, superior, middling and inferior, Gaits as modified by their peculiar condition,</p>
<p>31. Their Gaits should be of the duration of four or two Kalās, one Kalā or half of a Kalā, and these should be so on attaining conditions other than normal ones,</p>
<p>32. [Relative position of different characters as regards the timing of their Gaits is as follows]: While a superior [character] will have a Gait of four Kalās, a middling [character] is to have that of two Kalās and an inferior [character] that of one Kalā,</p>
<p>33. When a middling character will have a Gait of a Kalā, an inferior character is to have that of half a Kalā. Thus one should reduce [in different Gaits under special conditions] Kalās by half.</p>
<p>34. Gait of superior persons is not to be applied to that of the middling type, and Gait of the middling characters is not to be applied to that of the inferior type.</p>
<h2 id="tempo-of-gaits-under-special-conditions"><em>Tempo of Gaits under special conditions</em></h2>
<p>35-37. In case of an attack of fever, hunger, fatigue due to austerities, [excessive] panic, surprise, dissimulation, uneasiness, love [in separation], sorrow, and in walking at ease, steps sḥould be of slow tempo falling at the interval of more than four Kalās¹. But in case of anxiety the Gait should be of four Kalās’ [duration].</p>
<p>37-40. In case of concealed (lit. uneasy) love, panic, fear, agitation, joy, hurried action, hearing of unwelcome news, insult, sight of porentuous objects, of urgent work, search for enemies, pursuit of an offender and pursuit a ferocious animal, the wise [actor] should have Gait with steps of two Kalās’ [duration].</p>
<h2 id="gait-in-the-erotic-sentiment"><em>Gait in the Erotic Sentiment</em></h2>
<p>40-44. Gait in open (i.e. very clear) love-making should be graceful. [The lover] is to enter the stage with the female messenger showing the way. He is to act his part.(lit. meaning connected with the play) by means of the Sūcā<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. He should use pleasant perfumes and be dressed with lovely garments, ornaments² and garlands of various sweet-smelling flowers. He should walk with graceful steps with a slow tempo in the Atikrāntā Cārī, and his limbs should have the Sauṣṭhava, and he should move with proper tempo and Tāla. His hands should always follow the feet. The former should be raised along with the falling of the latter, and with the raising of the latter the former should fall (lit. <em>vice versa</em>)³.</p>
<p>45-48. Now listen about the Gait in case of concealed love. After dismissing his servants (lit. men) the lover is to walk [at night] along with the female messenger as his guide. He is to put out the lamp. He is to be dressed in [simple] clothes suited to the time and is to not wear too many ornaments. In making love secretly a person is to walk in company of the female messenger with slow and silent steps. Being apprehesive of sounds [heard at the time] he is to uneasy and to look constantly around and to tremble in his body and to have a faltering Gait.</p>
<h2 id="gait-in-the-terrible-sentiment"><em>Gait in the Terrible Sentiment</em></h2>
<p>48-54. [In treating Gait] in the Terrible Sentiment I shall speak only with regard to Daityas, Rākṣasas and Nāgas. O Brahmins, the Terrible Sentiment only is dominant in their case. And this Terrible Sentiment is of three kinds, viz. Terrible in make-up, Terrible in limbs and Terrible by nature. [An example of] the Terrible in make-up is [a Rākṣasa] with his body dripping in blood, mouth moistened with it and having pieces of flesh in the hands. An example of the Terrible in limb is a very tall [Rākṣasa] with a prodigious physical frame, many heads, and many hands holding weapons of various kinds. And an example of the Terrible by nature, is a person with red eyes, tawny hair, black complexion and rough voice, and a person who always scolds [others] and who walks by raising the feet four Tālas high, and takes steps three Tālas wide. This is the Gait which [characters] resembling them are to have.</p>
<h2 id="gait-in-the-odious-sentiment"><em>Gait in the Odious Sentiment</em></h2>
<p>54-56. Gait [of a person walking] on the ground which is either a place of cremation or a place gruesome on account of a battle [having taken place there] should be used in acting in connexion with the Odious Sentiment. The feet in the Eḍakākrīḍitā Cārī falling in quick succession sometimes close to and sometimes wide apart from each other, with the hands following them, will constitute Gait in the Odious Sentiment.</p>
<h2 id="gait-in-the-heroic-sentiment"><em>Gait in the Heroic Sentiment</em></h2>
<p>57. In the Heroic Sentiment Gait should consist of swift brandishing of arms and observing of various Cārīs.</p>
<p>58. In case of mental excitement Gait should consist of footsteps of proper Kalā and Tāla (<em>kāla</em>) in the Pārśvakrāntā, Āviddhā and Sūcī Cārīs.</p>
<h2 id="gait-in-the-marvellous-and-the-comic-sentiments"><em>Gait in the Marvellous and the Comic Sentiments</em></h2>
<p>59-60. These are Gaits prescribed for generally superior characters. I shall now describe the Gait for middling and inferior characters. In their astonishment and joy they are to take agitated steps, and in their laughter too they are to take to this and similar other foot movements.</p>
<h2 id="gait-in-the-pathetic-sentiment"><em>Gait in the Pathetic Sentiment</em></h2>
<p>61-63. Gait in the Pathetic Sentiment should be in slow tempo [and it should be connected with] eyes full of tears, drooping limbs, arms thrown up and down, and loud weeping. And in case of a recent calamity one is to walk as well with the Adhyardhikā Cārī. This [Gait] is also to be used in case of women and persons of the inferior type.</p>
<p>63-66. [In connexion with the Pathetic Sentiment] superior characters should be patient, tearful, heaving deep sighs and looking upwards and [their Gait in conformity with these conditions] is to be of no [regular] measure and [they are] not to have the Sauṣṭhava [of the body]. Middling characters are also to be given Gait according to rules. In case of death of their beloved persons and relatives, they are to bend down on their breast in dejection and to become senseless due to grief, and to walk with the feet not raised very high When violently struck, the shoulder should recede and be protected by arms, and the [entire] body is to be made unsteady (lit. moved round), and walking [should be] with short steps.</p>
<p>67-69. A [special] Gait is to be assigned to women and persons of the inferior type when they are attacked with cold or are overtaken by a torrential shower. [In such a case] they are to draw all their limbs together, to shiver greatly, to put their two hands on the breast, to bend down their body, and their teeth are to clatter and lips are to throb and the chin is to quiver, and in representing an attack of cold the Gait should be slow.</p>
<h2 id="gait-in-the-terrible-sentiment-1"><em>Gait in the Terrible Sentiment</em></h2>
<p>70-75. In the Terrible [Sentiment] the experts should make the Gait of women, and men of inferior type who are lacking in spirits, suitable to their nature (lit. in that manner).</p>

Then he should make two Catura hands one of which is to be stretched. And assuming a serene appearance in conformity with the performance he should execute the Atikrāntā (Atikrama) Cārī with natural (lit. not drooping) limbs. The best ascetics with a great vow are to have such a Gait, and to others is to be given a Gait contrary to this.

<p>156. This Gait should be applied to [represent] lions<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> and such other animals<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> at the time of personal combat as well as on entering the stage.</p>

To His equals he (<em>i.e</em>. the king) is to offer seats equal in height to that of his own, to persons of medium importance, the seats of middling height, and to persons who are.superior to him should be given a more elevated seat, while the lowly persons are to be seated on the ground.</p>
<p>219. Before the preceptor, the king or the spiritual guide (<em>guru</em>) wise persons are to sit on the ground or on an wooden seat.</p>
<p>220. Sitting together with the spiritual guide, the preceptor or the king in a boat, on an elephant or in a chariot, or on [large] wooden seats is allowed (lit. not to be objected to).</p>
<h2 id="lying-down-postures"><em>Lying-down postures</em></h2>
<p>221. Postures in the bed are known as Ākuñcita, Sama, Prasārita, Vivartita, Udvāhita and Nata.</p>
<p>222. Ākuñcita: Lying down with limbs narrowed down and the two knees sticking to the bed is called the Ākuñcita posture. It is to be used in representing persons attacked with cold.</p>
<p>223. Sama: Lying down with the face upwards and the hands free and turning downwards is called the Sama posture. It is the posture in deep sleep.</p>
<p>224. Prasārita: Lying down with one arm as the pillow and the knees stretched, is called the Prasārita posture. It is to be used to represent one enjoying a sleep of happiness.</p>
<p>225. Vivartita: Lying down with the face downwards is called the Vivartita posture. It is to be assumed in [repre-senting] wound from any weapon, death, vomiting, intoxication and lunacy.</p>
<p>226. Udvāhita: Lying down with the head resting on the hand and making a movement of the knee, is called the Udvāhita posture. It is to be used in sports, and on hearing the master’s words.</p>
<p>227. Nata: Lying down with the legs (lit. shanks) slightly stretched and the two hands loosely resting is called the Nata posture. It is to be used in laziness, fatigue and distress.</p>
<p>228. This is the [rule of] Gait and movements I was to tell you. Whatever remains unsaid should be devised according to the demand of circumstances. I shall hereafter speak about the division of the stage into Zones in connexion with going about on it.</p>
<p>Here ends Chapter XIII of Bharata’s Nāṭyaśāstra, which treats of Gaits and other Movements.</p>

<p>It seems that upavahana gave rise to upohana (Pkt.) which afterwards was adopted in its place; for upohana see 138ff.

<p>The word kāñcukīya (kañcukin) should be translated as ‘armour-bearer’ and not as ‘chamberlain’ which term should be used for sannidhātṛ; See Kauṭilya’s Arthaśāstra (2.4.23). BhP. (p. 292) defines the Kañcukīya as follows: Passionless Brahmins who have knowledge and wisdom being in charge of (the king’s) armour and crown, and holding a cane-stick (as symbol of their authority), are called Kañcukīya by the wise.&#160;<a href="#fnref:10" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>a-vṛddhasya. The adjective of the kāñcukīya renders invalid the late definition according to which he should necessarily be old. Such a definition has been wrongly ascribed to Bharata in Rucipati’s commentary to the Anargharāghava (ed. in Kāvyamālā, p. 109). The kāñcukīya in the plays ascribed to Bhāsa (i.e. Svapna., Pratimā., Abhi. Pañca., Dūtavā, and Bāla.) does not show any trace of old age. The kañcukin in the Śak. deplores that the cane-stick which he had to take up as the symbol of his office, has become in old age the support of his body which he could move with difficulty (V.3.). From this it may be assumed that he was appointed long before old age came upon him.&#160;<a href="#fnref:11" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
