  <p>1. Listen [now] from me about those types [of songs] which have been called Dhruvās by Brāhmaṇas such as Nārada<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and others.</p>
<p>2. The Ṛk<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, Pāṇikā<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and Gāthā<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, and the Seven [traditional] Types [of songs]<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> which have seven different measures, are called Dhruvās.</p>
<p>3. O Brāhmaṇas, I shall discuss those [songs] in different metres which being created from those types, attain the status of Dhruvās.</p>
<p>4-6. The five classes of Dhruvās have always the following limbs (<em>aṅga</em>): Mukha, Pratimukha, Vaihāyasaka, Sthita, Pravṛtta, Vajra, Sandhi, Saṃharaṇa, Prastāra, Upavarta, Māṣaghāta, Caturasra, Upapāta, Praveṇī, Śīrṣaka, Saṃpiṣṭaka, Antāharaṇa and Mahājanika.</p>
<p>7. Songs consisting of one, two, three and four Vastus are respectively called the Dhruvā. Parigītikā, Madraka and Catuṣpadā.</p>
<p>8. The Dhruvā is so called, because in it words, Varṇas Alaṃkāra, tempo, Jāti and Pāṇis are regularly (<em>dhruvaṃ</em>) connected with one another.</p>
<h2 id="dhruvās-and-their-limbs"><em>Dhruvās and their limbs</em></h2>
<p>9. Depending on different conditions, the Dhruvās are known to be of five classes. I shall speak of the seven limbs which they consist of.</p>
<p>10. Limbs of the Prāveśikī Dhruvā are Upaghāta, Pravṛtta, Vajra and Śīrṣaka.</p>
<p>11. Limbs of the Aḍḍitā<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> Dhruvā are Prastāra, Māṣaghātā, Mahājanika, Praveṇī and Upapāta.</p>
<p>12. Limbs of the Avakṛṣṭā Dhruvā, are Mukha and Pratimukha, and of the Sthitā Dhruvā, limbs are Vaihāyasa and Antāharaṇa.</p>
<p>13. Similarly, of the Khañja-Nātkuṭā Dhruvā the limbs are Saṃhāra (Saṃharaṇa) and Caturasra, and of the Antarā Dhruvā, the limbs are Sandhi and Prastāra.</p>
<p>14. The limbs and the Kalās which are included in the songs, should be represented in the Dhruvās by means of [appropriate] types of metres.</p>
<p>15. The Tāla in a Dhruvā being Tryasra and Caturasra should, as said before, consist respectively, of six or of eight Kalās.</p>
<p>16. The limbs of all songs, which have been mentioned [before] are Vṛtta, Vivadha and Ekaka.</p>
<p>17-18. [The part of the song] which completes the Pada and the Varṇa, is called the Vidārī.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> I shall now speak of the rules regarding their<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> application to [different] characters [in a play]. The Vṛtta class of limbs will apply to the superior characters, and the Vivadha to the middling ones, and the Ekaka to the inferior characters.</p>
<p>18-19. Taking into account the application (<em>yoga</em>) [of the Tāla] which may be Tryasra or Caturasra, one should perform the Āvasānikī Dhruvā in its [proper] measure.</p>
<p>19-20. The Āvasānikī Dhruvā should have feet of metres which rest between Gāyatrī and Atiśakkarī.</p>
<p>20-21. The Āvasāniki Dhruvā which falls between the Śakkarī and Atikṛti metres, consists of a foot and a half of these.</p>
<p>21-22. The foot of an Āvasānikī Dhruvā should be made up of short and long syllables, according to the rules of Yati, metre and its measurement in mātrās.</p>
<p>22-23. For the superior and the middling characters the Āvasānikī Dhruvā should be Caturasra, and for the inferior characters it will be Tryasrā. When the Dhruvā is full of meaning in all its parts (<em>artha-pūrṇa-padī</em>) Vṛtta should be applied in it. On the strength of the Vṛtta the Dhruvā should be Āvasānikī.</p>
<p>24. Dhruvās originating in various metres are of five kinds. According to Sentiments which they contain they are superior, middling and inferior.</p>
<p>25. Dhruvās are of three classes: Kaniṣṭhikāgrahā, Sannipātāgrahā, and Apagrahā.</p>
<p>26-27. The first Dhruvā is Prāveśīkī (entering), the second one Ākṣepikī (indicating), the third one Prāsādikī (calming), the fourth one Antarā (transitional) and the fifth one is Naiṣkrāmikī (departing). I shall describe their metres.</p>
<p>28. The Vastu of the Gāndharva which I have spoken of as consisting of notes, Tāla and words, will be [called] Pada<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> when it will reflect notes and Tālas.</p>
<p>29. All that is made up of syllables, is called the Pada It is of two kinds according as it is [regularly] composed (<em>nibaddha</em>) or not so composed (<em>a-nibaddha</em>).</p>
<p>30. It is again of two kinds: conforming to no time-measure (<em>a-tāla</em>) and conforming to a time-measure (<em>sa-tāla</em>).</p>
<p>For the purpose of the Dhruvā, it is to conform to a time-measure and is to be [regularly] composed.</p>
<p>31. A Pada which conforms to no time-measure and which is not regularly composed, is connected with the Karaṇas<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> and it embellishes the playing of all kinds of musical instruments.</p>
<p>32. That which is furnished with a fixed number of syllables and which has a metre including caesura and has a time-measure and tempo (<em>laya</em>) for its syllables, is called a regularly composed Pada.</p>
<p>33. That which has a free metre and caesura and has no fixed number of syllables and has no [prescribed] time-measure and tempo, is called an irregularly composed Pada.</p>
<p>34. The syllables not regularly composed will be outside the Jāti songs, and one should describe their performance along with the Karaṇas of the musical instruments.</p>
<p>35. The Padas which are irregularly composed and not furnished with any time-measure, are connected with the musical instruments and they are [meant] to embellish the latter.</p>
<p>36. But those (Padas) which are regularly composed in persuance of the [rule of] syllables in a metre, are called the Dhruvās. I shall next speak of their characteristics.</p>
<p>37. The three Tryasra classes [of metre] to be applied in the Sthitāpakṛṣṭā [Dhruvā] are the Atyukta, Madhyā, Pratiṣṭha and Gāyātrī.</p>
<p>38. The Yugma class [of metres] to be applied in the Prāsadīkī Dhruvās are the Uṣṇik, Anuṣṭup, Bṛhatī and Paṅkti.</p>
<p>39-40. The classes [of metre] known to be in use in the Dhruvās of speed, are the Anuṣṭup, Bṛhatī, Jagatī, Drutā, Capalā, Udgatā and Dhṛti.</p>
<p>40-41. Now listen about the class [of metres] for the Prāveśīkī Dhruvās in case of energetic [characters]. The class of metres applicable to such characters are Paṅkti, Triṣṭup, Jagatī, Atijagatī and Śakkarī.</p>
<p>42. For all these classes three kinds of syllabic metres have been prescribed. They may be mostly in long syllables or in short syllables or may equally have long and short syllables.</p>
<p>43. The Apakṛṣṭā Dhruvās should be in metres mostly with long syllables, and the Drutā (quick) Dhruvās should be in metres containing mostly short syllables, and the remaining Dhruvās should be in metres having short and long syllables [in almost equal numbers],</p>
<p>44. Metres with odd number of syllables are to be applied in the Mukha, and these when made up of short syllables of even number, are to be applied in the Drutā Dhruvās.</p>
<p>45. Metres which have a small number. of syllables and are considered small metres, are to be applied in the Drutā Apakṛṣṭā as well as the Ākṣepikī Dhruvās.</p>
<p>46. Metres beginning with long syllables are to be used in the Sthitā [Dhruvā], and those beginning with short syllables are to be made the Druta Dhruvā, and metres with odd and even numbers [in alternate feet] are to be made the Ākṣepikī Dhruvā.</p>
<p>47. A metre consisting of short, and even number of syllables or of odd and small number of syllables are to be applied in the Ākṣepikī Dhruvās.</p>
<p>48. In case their Varṇas are to be increased they should include Śamyā in their Tāla. I am now describing all the classes of metre with examples of their patterns and according to their names, extent and use. Listen about these from me.</p>
<h2 id="the-metres-used-in-different-dhruvās">The metres used in different Dhruvās</h2>
<p>49. Hrī.—The metre with all syllables long in parts of <em>gāthā</em> feet, is called Hrī.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Ex. <em>Yo gaṅgāśṛt</em>.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>
<p>50. Atyuktā—The metre which has all syllables long [in all its feet of two syllables,] is Atyuktā.</p>
<p>Ex. <em>Īśaṃ devaṃ<br>
śarvaṃ vande</em>.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Tr</em>. I adore the god Śarva.</p>
<p>51. Taṭi—When the syllable in the middle is short [in feet of three syllables, the metre is Taṭi].</p>
<p>Ex. <em>Śaṃkaraḥ śūlabhṛt<br>
pātu māṃ lokakṛt</em>.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Tr</em>. Let Śaṃkarā who carries the Trident and creates the world, protect me.</p>
<p>52. Dhṛti—When the first syllable in its feet of three syllables is short [the metre is Dhṛti].</p>
<p>Ex. <em>Umeśaḥ surendraḥ<br>
tavāyur dadātu</em>.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Tr</em>. Let the lord of Umā who is the lord of gods, give you [long] life.</p>
<p>53. Rajanī—When the two syllables are short and one long in the triad of its feet, the metre is Rajanī.</p>
<p>Ex. <em>Adhikaṃ virahe<br>
madam dahati</em>.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Tr</em>. Love afflicts (lit. burns) greatly when one [is] in separation [from one’s beloved].</p>
<p>54. This (Rajanī) is also known as Madhya. These [Dhruvās] are all of the Vṛtta (syllabic) class. I shall now speak of the characteristics [of the Dhruvā of] the Pratiṣṭhā and the Supratiṣṭhā classes.</p>

<p><em>Tr</em>. This sun whose body is as brilliant as molten gold, and which is praised by Brahmins and Munis, is quickly ascending the dome of the sky and will be roaming there very soon.</p>
<p>271. These are the metres of the Caturasra-vivardhitā class. I shall speak below of metres on the basis of mora.</p>
<p>272-273. The final foot of Supratiṣṭhā metres, is to consist of two <em>gaṇas</em> and a half, while their four feet will contain only six <em>gaṇas</em>. Similarly the Apakṛṣtā [Dhruvās] should have the final foot consisting of two <em>gaṇas</em> and a half, and [the entire song] should consist of ten <em>gaṇas</em>.</p>
<p>274. In case of the Aḍḍitā [Dhruvā] the final foot will consist of three <em>gaṇas</em> and a half, while the entire song will consist of fourteen <em>gaṇas</em>.</p>
<p>275. The Dvipadas of the Tryasra class should have its final foot consisting of six <em>gaṇas</em> and half while the entire the song should have eleven <em>gaṇas</em>.</p>
<p>276. The [final] foot of the Caturasra Dvipadas should consist of eight <em>gaṇas</em> and a half, while the entire song should consist of fifteen <em>gaṇas</em>.</p>
<p>277. In the first feet of the Caturasras the <em>gaṇas</em> containing one long and one short, should be not less than two, and more than nine.</p>
<p>278. In the Tryrasra such <em>gaṇas</em> should not be less than five and more than nine, and in the Caturasra such <em>gaṇas</em> should not be less than seven and more than ten.</p>
<p>279. <em>Gaṇas</em> if they consist of heavy syllables, should be in Caturasra not less than five, and more than nine if they are all short. Or they may be not less than seven if they are all long, and more than thirteen if they are all short.</p>
<p>280. These are the accounts of the total number of syllables in case of all Dhruvās. I shall now speak of the different parts of the Dvipada and number of <em>gaṇas</em> they are to contain.</p>
<p>281. In the Tryasra Dhruvās, the first foot will consist of eleven and the final foot of twenty-one <em>gaṇas</em> which are made up of a long syllable followed by a short one.</p>
<p>282. In the Caturasra Dhruvās the first foot will consist of sixteen and the last foot of twenty <em>gaṇas</em> made up of a long syllable followed by a short one.</p>
<p>283. Śīrṣakas have no rule of their feet. They are to consist of two long syllables in the beginning, the middle and the end, followed by a short syllable.</p>
<p>284. In the Tryasra Dhruvās the Sannipāta should be of five <em>gaṇas</em> [in length], and in the Caturasra Dhruvā the Sannipāta should be of eight <em>gaṇas</em>.</p>
<p>285. The two pādas are the Sannipāta of the Dhruvās. They are Druta and Śīrṣaka, and besides these there are other two.</p>
<p>286. <em>Gaṇas</em> in the Tryasra are not less than five and more than nine, and in the Tryasra they are not less than eight and more than eighteen.</p>
<p>287. <em>Gaṇas</em> if they consist of long syllable should be in the Caturasra Dhruvā not less than five and more than nine, if they are all short. Or they may consist of not less than eight and more than thirteen.</p>
<p>288. These are the <em>gaṇas</em> to be known by the expert in Dhruvās. I shall now speak of the distribution of <em>gaṇas</em> and <em>mātrās</em> in the Drutā Dhruvās.</p>
<p>289. The Sannipāta of the Drutā Dhruvās is to consist of six <em>gaṇas</em> and a half, and these are to be made up of twenty-two <em>mātrās</em> in long and short syllables.</p>
<p>290. In the Śīrṣakas these should be rules regarding their pādas, and they are to be made up of different metres.</p>
<p>291. In them there should be <em>gaṇas</em> beginning with long syllables or with short syllables or having all short syllables, and they will vary from the precious metre (?).</p>
<p>292. The Śīrṣaka will have pādas consisting of seven <em>gaṇas</em> and a half, and they will include their mātrās in pādas of even or odd number of syllables.</p>
<p>293. In the Śīrṣaka there should be not less than twenty-one and more than twenty-six syllables in each foot.</p>
<p>294. In the four feet there should be even and odd number of syllables mixed up, and according to rule there should be collection of short syllables in the Śīrṣaka.</p>
<p>295. If there are three short <em>gaṇas</em> in the beginning, three such in the end, and two long <em>gaṇas</em> in the middle, then the Capalā will be called Śīrṣaka.</p>
<p>296. In the first half there should always be four short and four mixed <em>gaṇas</em>, and the rest will be collection of short syllables.</p>
<p>297. Pauses (<em>virāma</em>) of the Dhruvās to be made by the Prāsādikī, Antarā and Ākṣepikī Dhruvās should have duration of one, two, three, four, six or eight Kalās.</p>
<p>298. The Pause in the Tryasra Dhruvā will be of three Kalās, and in the Caturasra it will be of four Kalās. This is the rule in the Prāveśīkī as well as the Naiṣkrāmikī Dhruvās.</p>
<p>299. The Pause in the Antarā Dhruvā is of two Kaläs duration, and the Pause in the Antarā is at the end of a pāda.</p>
<p>300. In the Sthitā and the Prāsādikī Dhruvās the pause will be at the end of half of the pāda, and the Kalās will be as described above increased by half a Kalā, and they will consist of short and long syllables.</p>
<p>301. The Sthitā Dhruvā should have mostly long syllables, and the Drutā Dhruvā mostly short syllables and the Prāsādikī and the Antarā Dhruvās an admixture of short and long syllables [in equal measure].</p>
<p>302. Thus should be made metres of the Dhruvās originating in the Vṛtta class. I shall next speak of definition of the various Śīrṣakas.</p>

<p><em>Tr</em>. The cuckoo comes to the forest where other birds have [already] come to adorn it and where the trees are in flowers and the bees are singing.</p>
<p>355. These are the primary (lit. original) classes of the Natkuṭa, and from these come out others having even or odd [number of syllables in their feet or having feet of] unequal [number of syllables].<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup></p>
<p>356. Dhruvās have sixty-four primary classes some of which are made up of equal number of syllables [in then-feet] and different from this [are made up of] unequal [number of syllables].</p>
<p>357. Dhruvās of three kinds having even or odd number of syllables or having even and odd or unequal [number of syllables in their feet] may be of various metres.</p>
<p>358. Dhruvās having even [number of syllables in their] metrical feet are two hundred and eighty five in number, and those having partially even number are one hundred and ten, and similar is the number of Dhruvās which are having uneven [number of syllables in their feet.]</p>
<p>359. Dhruvās of unequal length in feet or with unequal number of feet, are [also] generally made, and the names to these metres may be given according to one’s will<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="five-aspects-of-dhruvās">Five Aspects of Dhruvās</h2>
<p>360. These are the classes [of Dhruvās] arising out of various metres. I shall now speak of their [different] aspects due to five causes.</p>
<p>361. These five causes are: Class (<em>Jāti</em>), Occasion (<em>sthāna</em>), Variety (<em>prakāra</em>), Measure (<em>pramāna</em>) and Name (<em>nāma</em>).</p>
<p>362. The number of syllables in the metre of a Dhruvā constitute its Class (<em>Jāti</em>).<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup></p>
<p>Such numbers being odd or even, will give rise to its Variety (<em>prakāra</em>).</p>
<p>363-364. The Tāla of six or eight Kalās observed in Dhruvās will constitute their Measure (<em>pramāṇa</em>),<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup> and just as Names are applied to men according to their clan (<em>gotra</em>) family (<em>kula</em>) and customs (<em>ācāra</em>), so they are applied to Dhruvās according to their depending on an Occasions (<em>sthāna</em>).</p>
<h2 id="five-occasions-for-dhruvās">Five occasions for Dhruvās</h2>
<p>364. Occasions in connexion with. Dhruvās are five, viz. entrance (<em>praveśa</em>), diversion (<em>ākṣepa</em>), departure (<em>niṣkrāma</em>) calming (<em>prāsādana</em>) and transition (<em>antara</em>).<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup></p>
<p>365. Themes of various Sentiment sung at the entrance of persons [into the stage] are called the Prāveśīkī Dhruvā.</p>
<p>366. When in a [dramatic] performance at the end of Acts songs are sing at the exit of characters to indicate their going out, they are Naiṣkāmikī Dhruvās.</p>
<p>367. When the experts, in disregard of the rules, have a Dhruvā of medium or of slow tempo sung in a quick tempo, it is called the Antarā Dhruvā.</p>
<p>368. The song which after [sudden] distraction calms the audience (lit. auditorium) who are enjoying a different Sentiment, is called a Prāsādikī Dhruvā because it calms (<em>prasādayati</em>) their feeling.</p>
<p>369-370. The Antarā Dhruvās are those songs which are sung at the time of the [principal] characters being gloomy, absent-minded, angry, asleep, intoxicated, or their enjoying other’s company, being under heavy weight, or being in a swoon, or their fainting due to poisoning, or being in error, or their adjusting or fixing up clothes and ornaments, and in covering any of their faults [in acting],</p>
<p>371. I shall now speak about the Occasions (<em>sthāna</em>) together with the Sentiments and States where all the Dhruvās are to be sung carefully.</p>
<p>372. The Occasions are of two kinds, viz., relating to others and relating to one’s own-self. Listen now from me about that [Occasion] which is connected with diversion (<em>ākṣepa</em>).</p>
<p>373. When one is captured, obstructed, fallen, attacked with illness, or is dead or in a swoon, there the Apakṛṣṭā Dhruvā in the Pathetic Sentiment should be sung.</p>
<p>374. Where one is in [a state of] impatience, dissimulation, anxiety, lamentation, weariness, depression and dispair, a Dhruvā in a slow tempo should be sung.</p>
<p>375. In these States and in pathetic reports the Dhruvā should be sung in a quick tempo furnished with a rapid movement.</p>
<p>376. Where there is any sorrow from seeing before one’s own eyes any one killed or wounded, the Dhruvās there should be in a slow tempo and in the Pathetic Sentiment.</p>
<p>377-378. In case of seeing any calamity, of intolerance, seeing anything supernatural, being in despair, in carelessness and in anger, and in showing one’s spirit, and in a direct report of anything in Furious, Heroic, Terrible and such other Sentiments, and in agitation and in hurry, the Dhruvā should be sung in a quick tempo.</p>
<p>379-380. In propitiating, requesting or recollecting any one or in an exggerated speech or in meeting [of lovers] for the first time, in joy, in begging or in seeing anything strange in connection with love-making the Dhruvā should be of the Prāsādikī class and in a medium tempo.</p>
<p>381. In physical distress and in anger and in aiming a missile [against any one] the Antarā Dhruvā should be made continuous.</p>
<p>382. No Dhruvā should be sung when there is any entry of weeping or singing persons, and when there is any hurry in their coming or when they announce anything, or any calamity or surprise occurs [at the time].</p>
<p>383. Dhruvās should be thus applied after taking into consideration the rule regarding themes, places, times and seasons [involved], the characters [in the play] and indication of the States.</p>
<p>384. Dhruvās are of six kinds, viz. Śīrṣaka, Uddhatā, Anubandha, Vilambitā, Aḍḍitā and Apakṛṣṭā.</p>
<p>385. A Dhruvā which is at the position of <em>śīrṣa</em> (head) is called the Śīrṣaka.</p>
<p>A Dhruvā is called Uddhatā because it is sung in an <em>uddhata</em> (elevated) manner.</p>
<p>386. A Dhruvā which is begun in a playlike (?) manner and which adopts a tempo meant for it, is called Anubandha.</p>
<p>387. The Vilambitā Dhruvā is that which according to the dramatic convention, moves always slowly or not very quickly.</p>
<p>388. When a Dhruvā arises in connexion with the Erotic Sentiment and has some extraordinary quality, it is pleasant and is called Aḍḍitā.</p>
<p>389. A Dhruvā which for the reason of its being sung (lit. drawn up) in other States (?) for reasons [other than that with which it began] is called the Apakṛṣṭā.</p>
<p>390. The Excited Prāveśikī Dhruvā, when the movement has been arrested (?) or delayed, should be applied in case of male characters.</p>
<p>391. The Pāsādikī Dhruvā in case of females will be [of] the Aḍḍitā [class], and when it is in a slow tempo it will be Apakṛṣṭā and that which is not Drutā will be Vilambita.</p>
<p>392. As tempo, instrumental music, pause, words, letters and syllables accompany a song, these six are called its entering aspects.</p>
<p>393. Śīrṣaka and Aḍḍitā belong to kings and gods. Aḍḍitā is to be applied in case of women of divine, royal and Vaiyśa origin.</p>
<p>394. At the entrance of middling characters the Dhruvā should be of the Druta-Vilambita [class], and in case of inferior characters it should be of the Natkuṭā and Khañjaka [classes].</p>
<p>395. The Khañjaka and Natkuṭa will be for bringing joy to the occasion. Why is it so? Because these two belong to Comic and Erotic Sentiments.</p>
<p>396. In case of inferior characters and of any one dead, there should be Anubandha with [proper] tempo. In case of women of the Kṣatriya and Vaiśya classes there should be Apakrīṣṭā Dhruvā in proper tempo.</p>
<p>397. The Prāveśikī Dhruvā should have Tāla with four Sannipātas. The remaining ones are to have two Sannipātas, and the Śīrṣakas are to have six pādas.</p>
<p>398. Aḍḍitā with a slow tempo, is not to be sung in case of inferior characters. In their movements relating to all the States, one should sing the Natkuṭa Dhruvā.</p>
<p>399. These (the inferior characters) have only three States, viz. Comic, Pathetic and Terrible. One should apply Dhruvā to them with a view to this fact.</p>
<p>400. The wise should apply the Dhruvā after taking into consideration the theme (<em>vastu</em>), performance (<em>prayoga</em>), characters (<em>prakṛti</em>), in a play, Sentiments, States, seasons, age, locality, time and mental condition (<em>apasthā</em>),</p>
<p>401. The theme (<em>vastu</em>) arises from a locality, and may relate to a city or a forest. The performance (<em>prayoga</em>) relates to divine and human beings.</p>
<p>402. The characters in a play (<em>prakṛti</em>) are of three kinds, viz. superior, inferior and middling. Sentiments and States have already been described before. The season (<em>ṛtu</em>) occurs due to the flux of time.</p>
<p>403. Infancy, youth and old age are the three ages.</p>
<p>Locality relates to the Zonal and other divisions of various kinds.<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup></p>
<p>404. The time is fixed by day and night, and by months and seasons. The [mental] condition relates to joy and sorrow.</p>
<p>405. These are always the features in different situations. The wise should apply all these [in a play] after taking the Sentiments and the States into consideration.</p>
<p>406. Those things which cannot be expressed in speech should be presented in a song; for through songs only, the strength and ripeness comes to the meaning of words (<em>vakyārtha</em>).</p>
<h2 id="contents-of-dhruvās"><em>Contents of Dhruvās</em></h2>
<p>407. Dhruvās in case of men and women of superior inferior or middling class, should relate to [objects] comparable to them in quality.</p>
<p>408. In case of gods and kings the comparable objects are the moon<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>, fire, the sun<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup> and the wind,<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup> and in case of Daityas and Rākṣasas they are clouds,<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup> mountains<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup> and seas.<sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup></p>
<p>409. In case of Siddhas, Gandharvas and Yakṣas, comparable objects are the planets, stars<sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup> and bulls, and for all these persons engaged in practice of austerities (<em>tapas</em>) comparable objects are the sun<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>, fire and wind.<sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup></p>
<p>410. For all Brahmins and and other persons engaged in austerities, the comparable object is fire, and for their wives the comparable object will be the same.</p>
<p>411. Lightning<sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>, meteor, and the sun’s rays are objects comparable to the heavenly beings, and objects comparable to gods, apply to the case of kings also.</p>
<p>412. Elephants<sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>, lions and bulls are not comparable to heavenly beings, and elephants, serpents and lions are to be compared with kings.</p>
<p>413. Mischievous beings like the Yakṣas, Rākṣasas and Bhūtas are comparable to the buffalo, <em>ruru</em> deer, lions and other carnivorous animals.</p>
<p>414. A rutting elephant<sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup> and a swan<sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup> are compared with superior characters in connection with various Sentiments.</p>
<p>415. Cranes<sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup> (<em>sārasa</em>), peacocks<sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>, <em>krauñca</em>, ruddy geese<sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>, and lakes with <em>kumuda</em> flowers, have quality [enough] to be compared with middling characters.<sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup></p>
<p>416. The cuckoo<sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup>, bee<sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>, crow, osprey<sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup>, owl<sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup> and crane, pigion and <em>kādamba</em> are comparable to inferior characters.</p>
<p>417. Now listen about the objects comparable to wives of superior, inferior and middling characters.</p>
<p>418. The night<sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup>, earth, moonlight, lotus-lake<sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup>, female elephant, and the river have qualities enough to be compared with wives of kings.</p>
<p>419. A lake<sup id="fnref:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">68</a></sup>, osprey, creeper<sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup>, female crane<sup id="fnref:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup>, pea-hen and female deer are always to be compared with wives of middling characters as well as with courtezans.<sup id="fnref:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">71</a></sup></p>
<p>420. A hen, bee, crow, cuckoo and owl of female species are to be mentioned in the Dhruvās connected with wives of inferior characters.</p>
<p>421. Comparison about going, and any other movement [should be indicated by] the Prāveśikī and Naiṣkrāmikī Dhruvā.</p>
<h2 id="dhruvās-to-suit-time-and-occasion"><em>Dhruvās to suit time and occasion</em></h2>
<p>422. The Prāveśikī Dhruvā is to be sung to indicate anything happening in the forenoon. And the Naiṣkrāmikī Dhruvā may serve [in general] for anything occurring throughout day and night.</p>
<p>423. Gentle Dhruvās are to be sung to indicate the forenoon, and excited (<em>diptā</em>) Dhruvās are to be sung to indicate the noon, whereas pathetic Dhruvās are to be sung in case of afternoon and evening.</p>
<p>424. Any report about going is to be expressed by the Prāveśikī Dhruvā, and that which relates to anything stationary is to be have recourse to the Ākṣepikī Dhruvā.</p>
<p>425. The Ākṣepikī Dhruvās are all to be sung in a quick as well as in a slow tempo. Thus will be these Dhruvās when they arise in connexion with anger and intolerance, and are in the Pathetic, Marvellous and Terrible Sentiments.</p>
<p>426. All objects existing in the earth in connexion with a dead body or with a god, are to be mentioned in the [Dhruvā] song with suitable comparison.</p>
<h2 id="dhruvās-to-indicate-movements"><em>Dhruvās to indicate movements</em></h2>
<p>427. Comparable objects in case of stationary things should be stationary, and in case of their moving they should be compared with moving objects, and their States due to jöy and sorrow should be related to qualities in their objects of comparison.</p>
<p>428. In case of chariots, horses, elephants, deer, birds, palanquins and aerial cars, the experts should make Dhruvās with a view to their movement and progress.</p>
<p>429-430. In case of chariots, arrows, horses, elephants, heavenly cars, swings and birds as vehicles, the expert should compose the Dhruvā with words and syllables which can be uttered quickly. In case of bulls, elephants, lions and bears, the Dhruvā should be made up of heavy syllables that can be uttered with force.</p>
<p>430-431. In case of crows, monkeys, swans, and peacocks, the Dhruvās should be made up of light syllables with swift movement, and of heavy syllables with their slowness.</p>
<p>This being the case one should apply swift [Dhruvās] after knowing the States [in their connexion].</p>
<h2 id="metres-for-dhruvās"><em>Metres for Dhruvās</em></h2>
<p>432-433. Words of a song cannot be without a metre. Hence after considering [contents of] the Dhruvā song, one should put it in a suitable metre.<sup id="fnref:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">72</a></sup> Hence a Dhruvā to express the movement of a vehicle, should be made up of [suitable] syllables, so that the different limbs of the song may agree with the instrumental music.</p>
<p>434. The metre which is prescribed for the foot of a Dhruvā in connexion with the movement of a vehicle, should also be available in the instrumental music, and it should be also agreeing with the movement of all the limbs [of a song].</p>
<p>435. The song should be taken up first, then the instrumental music, and the dance will be taken up afterwards. A combination of song and instrumental music [with dance] is called a performance (<em>prayoga</em>).</p>
<p>436. The State which is in one’s heart, should be depicted by means of histrionic representation in all its limbs and with Sūcā of the Nivṛtyaṅkura<sup id="fnref:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">73</a></sup> [class].</p>
<p>437. The Prāsādikī Dhruvā arising from the quality of giving joy, should be applied when there is a man in the sky and speaking to the sky.<sup id="fnref:74"><a href="#fn:74" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">74</a></sup></p>
<p>438-439. The Dhruvā in this case connected with speaking, should [completely] suit the meaning of its name, when the Dhruvā connected with pleasing or jealousy and anger, attains the Erotic Sentiment, it should be suited to the meaning [of it name].</p>
<p>And when there are occasions of pleasing, Dhruvās connected with the [different] Sentiments, should be made Prāsādikī to suit the meaning [of their names].</p>
<h2 id="the-language-of-dhruvās"><em>The Language of Dhruvās</em></h2>
<p>440. The language in the application of Dhruvās should be Śūrasenī.<sup id="fnref:75"><a href="#fn:75" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">75</a></sup> Sometimes it may be Māgadhī<sup id="fnref:76"><a href="#fn:76" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">76</a></sup> when [the Dhruvās of] the Natkuṭa [class] are to be made by the wise.</p>
<p>441. Sanskrit songs<sup id="fnref:77"><a href="#fn:77" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">77</a></sup> have been prescribed by the authorities in case of heavenly beings; and in case of human beings half-Sanskrit<sup id="fnref:78"><a href="#fn:78" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">78</a></sup> [songs] should be used.</p>
<p>442. Listen about their treatment if the gods who have been made objects of comparison, makes entrance in a play in course of its action.</p>
<p>443. That which is their Sāttvika State and constitutes a narration of their deeds, should be expressed through a song according to the authoritative rules.</p>
<h2 id="metres-of-dhruvās"><em>Metres of Dhruvās</em></h2>
<p>444. Songs in case of heavenly beings are desired to be in metres of [suitable] measure (size). This should relate to their praise or a narration of their exploits. In the feet of Dhruvās one should describe that which relates to the qualities of comparison.</p>
<p>445. [In this connexion] the metres [like] Mālā, Vaktra, Puṭavṛtta Viślokā, Cūlikā, Udgatā and Aparavaktra should be used by the producers.</p>
<p>446-447. I have described their structure (lit. rules of metre) before.<sup id="fnref:79"><a href="#fn:79" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">79</a></sup> In case of gods, these (i.e. Dhruvās) should include words expressing victory or blessing, and for them (i.e. gods), Ṛc, Gāthā and Pāṇikā, will be understood as their form (lit. measure). As these are pleasing to hear they should be put in tune (lit. applied in songs).</p>
<p>448. The Jātis including Gāndhāra, Ṣaḍja, Madhyama, Pañcama and Dhaivata should be reckoned as the [suitable] form of these songs.<sup id="fnref:80"><a href="#fn:80" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">80</a></sup></p>
<p>449. Their form to suit the four occasions should be such as Prāsādikī, Sthitā, Naiṣkrāmikī and Prāveśikī.</p>
<p>450. In the various acts of gods when there is no obstacle, Sanskrit should often be used in the Anuṣṭubh metre.</p>
<p>451. The metres like Mālā, Vaktra, and Aparavaktra are suited to Prāveśikī Dhruvā, and Puṭa and Culikā are meant for Naiṣkrāmikī Dhruvās.</p>
<p>452. Udgatā (metre) is applicable in the Prāsādikī Dhruvā and Anuṣṭubh in the Vilambitā Dhruvā. These occasions are to be expressed by one who is an expert in measures.</p>
<p>453-454. The song which is in the Anuṣṭubh metre, and is in a slow tempo, and relates to a fall due to curse, suffering from anxiety, and abounds in heavy syllables, notes of pathetic expression, and long-drawn-out Varṇas, should have the Sthita Sthāna.</p>
<p>455. For the excitement of human beings, and for their roaming [over different places], heavenly beings are to resort to songs in the Anuṣṭubh metre.</p>
<p>456. In relating the memory of those of heavenly beings who are born amongst mortals, one should resort to suitable songs expressing heavenly States.</p>
<p>457. And suitable songs relating to the sorrow of these very beings when these are meant to kill sorrow and anxiety, are to deal with a change due to afflicted conditions.</p>
<h2 id="dhruvās-to-suit-occasions"><em>Dhruvās to suit occasions</em></h2>
<p>458. Listen now what are generally to be done for the rule of Dhruvās occurring to their division of occasions.</p>
<p>459. When the instruments of music have been placed in order, and the three Sāmans have been uttered, one should apply the Āśrāvaṇā<sup id="fnref:81"><a href="#fn:81" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">81</a></sup> included in the Bahirgītā.<sup id="fnref:82"><a href="#fn:82" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">82</a></sup></p>
<p>460. After performing the Bahirgīta one should perform the Pūrvaraṅga<sup id="fnref:83"><a href="#fn:83" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">83</a></sup> and the Pūrvaraṅga having been undertaken one should perform the Raṅgadvāra.<sup id="fnref:84"><a href="#fn:84" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">84</a></sup></p>
<p>461. In connexion with the entrance of characters, one should sing the Dhruvā indicating movement and also the Parivarta.</p>
<p>462. By taking steps upon the stage while singing or due to [some other] need, one should make six Parivartas.<sup id="fnref:85"><a href="#fn:85" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">85</a></sup></p>
<p>463-464. The Dhruvā in this case should be made as in the case of gods, and the Pātas there, should be twenty-one in number. The Dhruvā in its application in drama should be of the Tryasra or of the Caturasra type. In case of the Tryasra the Pāda-pāta will consist of three Kalās, while in the Caturasra the Pāda-pāta will consist of four Kalās.</p>
<p>465-466. The Dhruvā in case of superior characters will be Caturasra and in case of the middling characters Tryasra type, and in case of the inferior characters it will be of the Khañja and the Natkuṭa class. This will be the rule about tunes in connexion with the movement of feet.</p>
<p>467. In case of hurry, calamity and anger it will consist of one Kalā or half of a Kalā. And the movement of feet will consist of three, two, one or of four Kalās.</p>
<p>468. At that time there should be a harmony of dance with the instrumental music and not with song. There should be no pause in Dhruvā of one or two Kalās in dance. So, there should be a harmony [of dance] with the instrument and not with the song</p>
<p>469. One should know the setting of feet in case of the State mentioned before, depending on the slow or the quick tempo, and should make harmony with the instrumental music.</p>
<p>470. The entrance after tossing the curtain, on account excessive joy, sorrow and anger, should be made simultaneous with the divisions (?).</p>
<h2 id="the-rule-of-graha"><em>The Rule of Graha</em></h2>
<p>471. These are the rules about Parivarta<sup id="fnref:86"><a href="#fn:86" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">86</a></sup> in a play. I shall now describe the Grahas<sup id="fnref:87"><a href="#fn:87" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">87</a></sup> in connexion with the instruments.</p>
<p>472. The song should start its Parivarta without any [music of the] instrument, and in the fourth Parivarta there should be the Graha of the instrument.</p>
<p>473. Sometimes there should be Sannipāta Graha, sometimes Tarjanī Graha and sometimes Ākāśa Graha In the Dhruvā songs.<sup id="fnref:88"><a href="#fn:88" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">88</a></sup></p>
<p>474. As the Graha in the Dhruvā is regulated by Kalā, Tāla and tempo (<em>laya</em>), it should be observed in the movements and walks, by means of instruments.</p>
<p>475. In the Śīrṣaka of the Uddhata classes of Dhruvās, the Graha should be by the Pradeśinī, and in the Vilambitā Aḍḍitā Dhruvā, it should be by the Sannipāta and the third [finger].</p>
<p>476-477. In Natkuṭa, Aḍḍitā and Prāsādikī Dhruvās the Graha will be in Sannipāta and in Drutā (quick) Dhruvās the Graha will be from above,<sup id="fnref:89"><a href="#fn:89" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">89</a></sup> and in Naiṣkrāmikī and Anubandha Dhruvās the Graha will be with the instruments. And for songs, there should not be made any repetition by the experts.</p>
<p>478. Natkuṭa Dhruvās should have four Grahas such Sannipāta, Śamyā, Tāla and Ākāśa.</p>
<p>479. In the entrance [of any character] with hurry, excitement and joy, there should be the Graha with the song, and such a Graha is called Udghātya.</p>
<p>480. In case of falling of ornaments, clothes or of any disorder, any loss of memory, fatigue, and in the [general] covering of faults, there should be the Udghātya Graha of the Antarā [Dhruvā].</p>
<h2 id="application-of-songs"><em>Application of songs</em></h2>
<p>481. Producers should in this manner apply in their proper places, the Dhruvās required for dance and drama.</p>
<p>482. Just as a well-built dwelling house<sup id="fnref:90"><a href="#fn:90" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">90</a></sup> does not become beautiful without any colour, so without any song the drama does not attain [the capacity of giving] joy.</p>
<p>483. The rule regarding songs have been mentioned in connection with [the formalities of] the Pūrvaraṅga (Preliminaries), and the worship of gods has also been mentioned there.<sup id="fnref:91"><a href="#fn:91" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">91</a></sup></p>
<p>484. Hence notes in the two Grāmas as well as the Overlapping [note],<sup id="fnref:92"><a href="#fn:92" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">92</a></sup> should be applied to plays (lit. poetical compositions) which express the various States.</p>
<p>485-486. In the Opening<sup id="fnref:93"><a href="#fn:93" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">93</a></sup> of the drama there should be the songs of the Madhyama Grāma, Ṣaḍja in the Progression, the Overlapping in the Development, Pañcama(mī) in the Pause, and Kaiśika(kī) in the conclusion. These songs depending on the Junctures and metres, should be of suitable Sentiments and States.</p>
<p>487. Dhruvās depending on the context and made to express Sentiments suited to the situation, embellish the drama just as the stars illumine the sky.</p>
<p>488. The Māgadhī is the first Gītī, then Ardhamāgadhī [the second], Saṃbhāvita the third and Pṛthulā the remaining one (<em>i.e</em>. the fourth).<sup id="fnref:94"><a href="#fn:94" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">94</a></sup></p>
<p>489. Māgadhī is known by the repetition of its pādas [in different tempo] and it is in the Citra [Vṛtti].<sup id="fnref:95"><a href="#fn:95" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">95</a></sup> Similar is the Ardamāgadhī, which has recourse to repetition twice.</p>
<p>490. Saṃbhāvitā depending mostly on heavy syllables is applied in the Vārtika (Vṛtti), and Pṛthulā consisting of light syllables in the instrumental music, is to be applied in the Dakṣiṇa Vṛtti.</p>
<p>491. These four Gītis are everywhere to be applied in songs by singers. These consisting of appropriate syllables are applied in Dhruvās also.</p>
<p>492. That which includes full notes, Varṇas, is embellished by instruments, relates to the three voice-registers, has three Yatis and three Mātrās, gives joy, is harmonious (<em>sama</em>) and delicate, contains Alaṃkāras, is performed with ease, and has sweetness, is called a song [<em>per excellence</em> ].</p>
<p>493. One should first of all bestow care on songs. For songs have been called the resting place (lit. bed) of the drama. The song and the playing of musical instruments being well-executed, the performance of the drama does not encounter any risk.<sup id="fnref:96"><a href="#fn:96" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">96</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="qualities-of-singers-and-players-of-instruments">Qualities of singers and players of instruments</h2>
<p>494. I have thus spoken properly of the characteristics of Dhruvās. I shall now speak of [requisite] qualities of singers and players of musical instruments.</p>
<p>495. Knowledge proceeds from qualities, and mind gets repulsed due to faults. Hence one should carefully know in brief the qualities and faults.</p>
<p>496. The singer should be of young age, have a loving nature and a throat full of sweet voice. He should thoroughly know about tempo, Tāla, division of Kalās, their measure and application.<sup id="fnref:97"><a href="#fn:97" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">97</a></sup></p>
<p>497-498. A woman possessing a good physique, brilliance, courage and sweetness, also a voice which is soft, sweet and has a charming resonance, and is harmonious, and auspicious, and who can properly observe a pause, is never nervous, and is an expert in songs together with their Tāla and tempo, and can regulate her Karaṇas according to musical instruments, and is young, is known as a female singer<sup id="fnref:98"><a href="#fn:98" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">98</a></sup> <em>[per excellence</em> ].</p>
<h2 id="characteristics-of-a-vīṇā-player"><em>Characteristics of a Vīṇā player</em></h2>
<p>499-500. The two Vīṇā players should be properly conversant with the use of Pāṇi,<sup id="fnref:99"><a href="#fn:99" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">99</a></sup> tempo and Yati<sup id="fnref:100"><a href="#fn:100" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">100</a></sup> properly alotted [to different parts of a song], should have nimble hands in producing sweet sounds, and should have the qualities of [good] singers. They should be attentive in mind and be able to sing well in accompaniment of other instruments and clearly produced Karaṇas<sup id="fnref:101"><a href="#fn:101" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">101</a></sup> and should be industrious, and should have a pleasing voice, much experience and should be experts in playing instruments in Vṛttis like Citra etc.</p>
<h2 id="characteristics-of-a-flute-player"><em>Characteristics of a flute-player</em></h2>
<p>501. The flute-player should be strong and careful, should properly know songs and their tempo, and be able to sing well in accompaniment of other instruments, and to produce a note which is voluminous as well as sweet and pleasing, and should possess a strong breath.</p>
<p>502. The music of a flute should thus be steady, continuous, expressive of Varṇa and Alaṃkāra, and be sweet, pleasing and able to cover the faults [of a performance].</p>
<h2 id="difference-between-male-and-female-song-and-recitation"><em>Difference between male and female song and recitation</em></h2>
<p>503. Generally songs are naturally suited to women, and recitatives are similarly suited to men. For women’s voice is naturally sweet and that of men are [naturally] strong.</p>
<p>504. The good quality in women’s recitation and sweetness in men’s songs, should be considered their adventitious qualities (lit. ornament) [and no part of their nature].<sup id="fnref:102"><a href="#fn:102" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">102</a></sup></p>
<p>505. If men lead [in songs] and the songs possess good characteristics, but have no sweetness, then these, do not impart any beauty [to the performance].</p>
<p>506. Hence women’s songs are naturally successful and so are men’s recitatives.<sup id="fnref:103"><a href="#fn:103" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">103</a></sup> When these are not (indiscriminately) attempted by one another, they become easy to perform.</p>
<p>507. Dānavas, Asuras, Rākṣasas, Yakṣas and Uragas (Nāgas) as males and females, have many actions and speeches.</p>
<p>508. [In such cases] women are to play men’s parts [very] carefully. For women are naturally able to make graceful movements [only].<sup id="fnref:104"><a href="#fn:104" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">104</a></sup></p>
<p>509. Men acquire Sauṣṭhava<sup id="fnref:105"><a href="#fn:105" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">105</a></sup> by regular exercise and practice, and women’s movement of limbs are naturally pleasing.</p>
<p>510. With an eye to this fact, (lit. thus) men are to instruct women in songs, musical instruments and recitatives relating to different characters.</p>
<p>511. There may be [allowed] a loss of proper note in women’s songs and playing of musical instrument. But this will not be sweet to the ear in case of men.</p>
<h2 id="qualities-of-a-teacher"><em>Qualities of a teacher</em></h2>
<p>512. The six qualities which a teacher should have, are memory, intelligence (<em>medhā</em>), judgement (<em>mati</em>), reasoning positive and negative (<em>ūhāpoha</em>), and ability to train pupils.</p>
<h2 id="qualities-of-a-disciple"><em>Qualities of a disciple</em></h2>
<p>513. The six qualities which a disciple should have, are intelligence, memory, willingness to serve (<em>ślāghā</em>), devotion [to work], spirit of emulation (<em>saṃgharṣa</em>), and enthusiasm.</p>
<h2 id="qualities-of-voice"><em>Qualities of voice</em></h2>
<p>514. The six qualities of voice are that it should be loud, compact, smooth, sweet, careful, and distinctly related to the three voice-registers.<sup id="fnref:106"><a href="#fn:106" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">106</a></sup></p>
<p>515. That which is heard from a distance, is called loud (<em>śrāvaka</em>). The loud voice which is sweet but not diffused, is called compact (<em>ghana</em>).</p>
<p>516. The voice which being loud does not become harsh, is smooth (<em>snigdhā</em>). If at the highest point of the voice-registers, there occurs no discordance, then the voice is called sweet (<em>madhura</em>).</p>
<p>517-518. The voice which does not lapse into excess or defficiency, is called careful (<em>avadhānavān</em>).</p>
<p>The voice which striking the head, the throat [and the chest] become sweet with reference to three places, provides always sweetness to the three voice-registers, is considered distinctly related to voice-registers (<em>tristhānaśobhī</em>).</p>
<h2 id="faults-of-a-singer"><em>Faults of a singer</em></h2>
<p>519. The five faults of a singer are that his voice (lit. he) may be Kapila, unsteady, Sandaṣṭa (bitten), Kākī (crow-like), and Tumbakī (nasal).<sup id="fnref:107"><a href="#fn:107" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">107</a></sup></p>
<p>520. When the voice is unnatural, and there is a gurgling sound, it is called Kapila. The voice of one who has phlegm in the throat, is also called Kapila.<sup id="fnref:108"><a href="#fn:108" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">108</a></sup></p>
<p>521. When there is an irregular excess or want of volume in voice, it is called unsteady. A lean voice is also given this name.</p>
<p>522-523. Voice produced by [unduly] using teeth, is called Sandaṣṭa (bitten) by good masters.</p>
<p>The voice which in its enunciation does not properly touch its due voice-register, and which is harsh, is called Kākī (crow-like).</p>
<p>The voice connected with the nose is called Tumbakī (nasal).</p>
<p>524. These are the essential facts about the qualities, and faults of voice, related by me. I shall next speak about the covered (<em>avanaddha</em>) instruments.</p>
<p>525. This is the Gāndharva<sup id="fnref:109"><a href="#fn:109" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">109</a></sup> which I have now described. This was formerly described by Nārada.</p>
<p>A man (lit., son of Manu) who will cause this to be performed, will receive the highest honour in this world.</p>
<p>Here ends the Chapter Thirty-two of the Nāṭyaśāstra, which treats of the Dhruvā Songs.</p>
