<p>58. These are the forms [of sentences] that are to create the Verbal Representation. I shall speak [hereafter] of the characteristics of the seven forms which it may have.</p>
<p>59. [A sentence may contain a statement which] treats an act visible (<em>pratyakṣa</em>) or invisible (<em>parokṣa</em>); it may relate to the present, past or future time; it may affect one’s ownself (<em>ātmastha</em>) or another (<em>parastha</em>).</p>
<p>60. “O this [person] is speaking and I am not speaking” is a statement which treats a visible act (<em>pratyakṣa</em>), affects another person (<em>parastha</em>) and relates to the present time.</p>
<p>61. “I am doing, or going or speaking” is a statement which affects one’s ownself, relates to the present time and treats a visible act.</p>
<p>62. “I shall do, go or speak” is a statement which affects one’s ownself, treats an invisible act and relates to the future time.</p>
<p>63. “All my enemies were killed, conquered and put to flight by me,” is a statement which affects one’s ownself as well as others, and relates to the past time.</p>
<p>64. “[The enemies] were killed and conquered by thee,” is a statement which treats an invisible act, affects others, and relates to the past time.</p>
<p>65. “This [person] is speaking, doing or going,” is a statement which affects another, relates to the present time and treats a visible act.</p>
<p>66. “He is going or doing” is a statement which affects another, relates to the present time and treats a visible act.</p>
<p>67. “They will do, go or speak,” is a statement which affects others, relates to the future time and treats an invisible act.</p>
<p>68. “That work is to be done today by me together with you,” is a statement which affects one’s ownself as well as another and relates to the present time.</p>
<p>69. Anything that is spoken on the stage (lit, in drama) under the cover of the hand, will affect one’s ownself, relate to something at one’s heart or will relate to an invisible (<em>parokṣa</em>) act.</p>
<p>70. The seven forms of this (<em>i. e</em>. Verbal Representation) will have many more varieties when they will be modified according to time, and persons (lit. of the self and others) who are affected.</p>
<p>71. These are the ways of the Histrionic Representation, known to producers of a drama. Different kinds of representations are to be made through these.</p>
<h2 id="harmonious-representation"><em>Harmonious Representation</em></h2>
<p>72. The Harmonious Representation is that in which the effort is equally shared by the head, the face, the feet, the thighs, the shanks, the belly and the waist.</p>

The acting (lit. drama) which is [performed] by physical efforts which are not violent, hurried or complex, and which rest on proper tempo (<em>laya</em>), time (<em>tāla</em>) and the measurement of Kalās, and in which words are distinctly uttered without harshness and hurry, is called “regular” (<em>ābhyantara</em>).</p>
<h2 id="irregular-histrionic-representation"><em>Irregular Histrionic Representation</em></h2>
<p>76. When it is of the opposite kind, and observes free movements and is not combined with songs and instrumental music, is called “irregular” (<em>bāhya</em>).</p>
<p>77. It is called “regular” when it conforms to the rule (lit. within the <em>lakṣaṇa</em> or rule) and ‘irregular’ when it is outside [the prescription] of the Śāstra.</p>
<h3 id="lakṣaṇa-defined"><em>Lakṣaṇa defined</em></h3>
<p>78. As by this, a performance is <em>lakṣyate</em> or marked, it is called <em>lakṣaṇa</em> (characteristic mark). Hence it is of use in a drama.</p>
<h3 id="some-prefer-practice-to-the-śāstra"><em>Some prefer practice to the Śāstra</em></h3>
<p>79. Those who have not received training from (lit. lived with) any master or who had no access to the Śāstras, resort to practices observed by others?<sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup></p>

<p>84. By slightly narrowing down the eyes and expanding the nostrils and in the same breath, the wise one is to represent the agreeable taste and the smell.</p>
<p>85. These are gestures which arise from the activities of the five sense-organs such as skin, eyes, nose, tongue and ears.</p>
<h2 id="importance-of-mind"><em>Importance of mind</em></h2>

<h3 id="indifferent-mind"><em>Indifferent mind</em></h3>
<p>91. An indifferent attitude should be represented by expressing not too much delight or to much abhorrence, and by keeping oneself in the middling state.</p>
<p>92. The representation of words like “[It is done] by him,” “It is his,” or “He does this” which relate to invisible acts is [an example of] indifferent attitude.</p>

<h2 id="a-kings-etiquette-towards-women"><em>A King’s Etiquette towards Women</em></h2>
<p>150. In this connexion I shall describe in detail the rules of Etiquette for kings in their enjoyment [of women’s love], which have been drawn out from the Science of Erotics.</p>
<h2 id="three-classes-of-women"><em>Three classes of women</em></h2>
<p>151-152. Women who have the nature of various animals are of three classes: “homely” (<em>ābhyantara</em>, lit. inside) “public” (<em>bāhya</em>, lit. outside) and “mixed” (<em>bāyābhyantara</em>, lit. outside and inside), A woman belonging to a high family is a “homely” (<em>ābhyantara</em>) and a courtezan, a “public” (<em>bhaya</em>) woman. A thoroughly tested (<em>kṛtaśauca</em>) woman, if she is a maiden of high family, is of the mixed (<em>bāhyābhyantara</em>) class.</p>
<p>153. A lady or a maiden may become subject to a king’s attention in his harem. But enjoying the company of a public woman is not desirable in connection with a king’s love-affair.</p>
<p>154. A king’s union takes place with a “homely” woman, and a common man may unite with a “public” woman, while the king may have union with a heavenly courtezan [only]<sup id="fnref:91"><a href="#fn:91" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">91</a></sup>.</p>
<p>155. The manner of love-making which is approved in case of [married] women of high family, will hold good in case of maidens too.

<p>157. Love [for a person] grows from hearing [about one] and [hearing] the charming conversation, seeing the personal beauty, or the sportive movement of limbs.</p>
<p>158. A woman becomes overpowered with love on seeing a young man who has personal beauty as well as other innate qualities, and has besides the knowledge of various arts and crafts.</p>
<p>159. An expert in this matter should then observe the various indications of love in men and women who desire one another’s company.</p>
<h2 id="signs-of-love"><em>Signs of love</em></h2>
<p>160. The glance in which [the eyes are] sportive, tearful, half-closed, upper eyelid is drooping and eyelashes are throbbing, is called Kāmyā. (lit. loving) and it should be used here.</p>
<p>161. The glance in which eyes are expanded up to the corner and have sportful and smiling expressions, is called Lalitā. It is used in women’s partial looks<sup id="fnref:94"><a href="#fn:94" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">94</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="signs-of-a-maidens-love"><em>Signs of a maiden’s love</em></h2>
<p>ī68. These are the various signs of love with which a woman not yet having an experience of the pleasure of intercourse will express differently her love which has ten stages<sup id="fnref:98"><a href="#fn:98" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">98</a></sup>.</p>

<p>184. When a woman introduces topic about him (<em>i.e</em>. the beloved) on all occasions and hates all [other] males, it is a case of Insanity (<em>unmāda</em>)<sup id="fnref:112"><a href="#fn:112" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">112</a></sup>.</p>
<p>185. To represent Insanity one should sometime look with a steadfast gaze, sometimes heave a deep sigh, sometimes be absorbed within oneself and sometimes weep at the [usual] time for recreation<sup id="fnref:113"><a href="#fn:113" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">113</a></sup>.</p>
<h3 id="sickness"><em>Sickness</em></h3>
<p>186. When after enjoying all objects fit for one in love, and even by desirable sprinkling, one fails to bring her condition under control, Sickness appears<sup id="fnref:114"><a href="#fn:114" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">114</a></sup>.</p>

<p>191. Thus in case of her not meeting (lit. getting) the beloved, one should represent, according to the Science of Erotics, for the Heroine all the stages of love except the last one<sup id="fnref:119"><a href="#fn:119" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">119</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="relief-in-love-sickness"><em>Relief in love-sickness</em></h2>
<p>197. When burning very much with the fire of love one will use [special] clothes, ornaments, scents, rooms and gardens which have a cooling effect.</p>
<h2 id="a-female-messenger"><em>A Female Messenger</em></h2>
<p>198. Suffering [thus] from love-sickness and being afflicted on many points she should send a female Messenger, expert in love affairs [to the beloved] to speak of her conditions.</p>
<p>199. The message sent through the female Messenger should relate to passionate love. She [should] deliver the same] with proper courtesy [and] say “This is her actual condition”.</p>
<p>200. Then due to manifold significance of the communication, he is to think of some means [of relief]. This is the rule to be observed by the experts where love is to be practised secretly.</p>

<p>202. Happy and unhappy conditions which occur [in connexion with love] in persons of various dispositions, and which are assumed by kings, are also followed by common people.</p>
<p>203. Kings have no difficulty in obtaining women; because means for this, is at their command. And the love that grows out of liberality produces delight.</p>
<p>204. Out of respect for the queens and for fear of their favourite women, kings are to make love secretly to women employed in the harem.</p>
<p>205. Though the kings may have many ways of making love, making it secretly will be [the most] pleasing [of all].</p>
<p>206. Attachment to a woman being shut out from a woman and difficulty in obtaining her, imparts the supreme delight to her love.</p>
<p>207. In case of women of the harem, the king’s diversion with them in day time may be permitted, but in Conjugal Union (<em>vāsaka</em>) meeting should take place at night.<sup id="fnref:122"><a href="#fn:122" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">122</a></sup></p>

<p>239. [In representing various activities of women] there should be on the stage no ascending of the bed-stead, no bath, no use of unguents and collyrium, no decoration of the body and no doing of the hair.</p>
<p>240. And women of the superior and the middling types should not be shown as very scantily draped (<em>apāvṛtā</em>) or wearing only one piece of garment (<em>ekavastrā</em>) and they should use no colour for their lips.</p>
<p>241. The prohibited mode of [of dress] will suit only the women of the inferior type, because of their low nature.<sup id="fnref:142"><a href="#fn:142" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">142</a></sup> But they too are not to be represented as doing what is improper.</p>
<p>242. Men and women in different Psychological States should in a play take up a flower when they dress themselves up (lit. in their taking ornaments).</p>
<p>243. A woman who has finished toilet waits for a while for the arrival of her beloved men. And while looking to his path she will hear the ringing of the bell indicating Nāḍikās.</p>
<h2 id="a-heroine-in-expectancy"><em>A Heroine in expectancy</em></h2>
<p>244. After hearing the sound of [the expected] Nāḍikā the Heroine excited [with joy) at [the chance of] the beloved one’s coming should run towards the gate with a trembling [body] and with her Heart about to stop.</p>
<p>245. And holding the door-frame with her left hand, and a door-blade with the right one, she should with straight eyes look up for the arrival of the beloved one.</p>
<p>246. She is to express anxiety, apprehension and fear due to some reasons, and when the beloved one fails to appear (lit. not seeing the beloved), she should turn sad at the moment.</p>
<p>247. Then after heaving a deep sigh she should shed tears and with a motionless heart drop down herself (lit. her limbs) on a seat.</p>
<p>248. Due to a delay of the beloved one she should connect (lit. ponder over) his coming with causes (lit. considerations) which may be good or bad.</p>
<p>245. She will think [as follows:] “Could the beloved one have been held up by serious duties, by the friends, or by the minister engaged in affairs of the state, or could He have been detained by some favourite woman?”</p>
<p>250. She should represent an appearance connected with the various good or bad causes [mentioned above] by means of physical omens like quivering or throbbing [of a particular limb.]</p>
<h2 id="personal-omens"><em>Personal omens</em></h2>
<p>251. Personal omens indicating things favourable to women, will occur to their left [side] while in case of all undesirable happenings they will take place on their right.</p>
<p>252. If the left eye, forehead, eyebrow, lip, thigh arm, or breast throbs, this, will indicate the coming [of the beloved].</p>
<p>253. If these will throb differently<sup id="fnref:143"><a href="#fn:143" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">143</a></sup> that will indicate something calamitous (lit. not desired). In case of perceiving such an evil omen she should at once faint.</p>
<p>254. As long as the beloved one has not come, her hand will rest on her cheek, and being careless about her toilet she should go on weeping.</p>
<h2 id="a-heroines-reception-of-the-beloved-one"><em>A Heroine’s reception of the beloved one</em></h2>
<p>255-256. But afterwards on seeing some good omen indicating his arrival the Heroine should represent that the beloved one has drawn near by means of feeling<sup id="fnref:144"><a href="#fn:144" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">144</a></sup> his smell, and on seeing him [come] she should joyfully get up and proceed to welcome the beloved one.</p>
<h2 id="receiving-the-guilty-lover"><em>Receiving the guilty lover</em></h2>
<p>256-238. And if the beloved one is guilty he should be given censure in due order by means of [appropriate] gestures and reproachful words as well as by Jealous Anger (<em>māna</em>), Insult, Fainting or Dissimulations and in case of women’s outburst of speech [in such cases] will consist of abuse.</p>
<p>258-261. In case of satisfaction [witnessing] a contest, love, doubt, responding to courtesy, and wonder, in case of private words relating to duty, wealth amour or in laughter, curiosity, flurry, calamity and acceding to a situation of fun and to his concealing any ascription of any fault, the Heroine should speak to the beloved one even if [His guilts require that] he should not be spoken to, because of these reasons.</p>
<p>261-262. Where there is affection there is fear also. And where there is jealousy there occurs love (<em>madana</em>).</p>
<h2 id="causes-of-jealousy"><em>Causes of jealousy</em></h2>
<p>The causes of this (<em>i.e</em>. jealousy) are fourfold: Depression (<em>vaimanasya</em>), Mixed Feeling (<em>vyalīka</em>), Disgust (<em>vipriya</em>) and Anger (<em>manyu</em>). Please listen about their description.</p>
<h3 id="depression"><em>Depression</em></h3>
<p>262-265. Depression arises from seeing the beloved one walking lazily due to sleepiness and lassitude, and discovering signs [of his Union with another woman] and fresh wounds [received from the latter].</p>
<p>264. A women should represent this with an intensely jealous face, great trembling of lips due to anger, and utterance of words like “It is good,” “It is nice” and “It is beautiful.”</p>
<h3 id="mixed-feeling"><em>Mixed feeling</em></h3>
<p>265. Mixed Feeling arises due to jealousy mixed with great joy when one’s beloved one is seen [near by] even after he has been treated with contempt in many ways.</p>
<p>266. Mixed Feeling should be represented by putting forward a foot and having the left hand on the breasts and the right one violently gesticulating.</p>
<h3 id="disgust"><em>Disgust</em></h3>
<p>267. Disgust (<em>vipriya</em>) will arise when the beloved one says that “I live [only] as long as you live,” “I am your slave” and “You are my love,” but behaves in a [quite] different manner,</p>
<p>268. Representation of Disgust should be made by repulsing the female Messenger, the latter’s solicitation of reply [made by the beloved one] and also by angry laughter weeping and shaking of the head.</p>
<h3 id="anger"><em>Anger</em></h3>
<p>269. Anger arises [in a woman] when the beloved one comes to her from the place of a rival woman, and carries the signs of his Union with her and boasts about his good luck in this matter.</p>
<p>270. Anger should be represented by turning round the Valayas [bangles) and throwing up the Rasanā in a loose manner and by apprehensive and tearful eyes.</p>
<h2 id="on-treating-a-lover-at-fault"><em>On treating a lover at fault</em></h2>
<p>271. On seeing the beloved one standing much ashamed and afraid due to his guilt, [the Heroine] should harass him with rebuke made up of words spoken in jealous [indignation].</p>
<p>272. But no very cruel words should be uttered, and no very angry words should also be applied. [The Heroine] should speak tearfully things referring to her ownself (<em>i.e</em>. her ill luck).</p>
<p>273-275. This attitude should be represented by placing on the breast a hand the middle finger of which is touch the edge of the lip, and by looking with eyes upturned, and looking continuously or assuming a Karaṇa in which a hand is placed on the hip with the fingers separated or by moving them on the head and letting them fall together or by a look of Dissimulation or by beautiful gestures finger of indicating threat.</p>
<p>275-277. After saying “You are shining,” “You look well,” “Go”, “Why are you tarrying”, “Don’t touch me,” “Go to the beloved one who is in your heart,” ‘And go away,” she should turn back and resume her joyful expression on any pretext.<sup id="fnref:145"><a href="#fn:145" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">145</a></sup></p>
<p>278. In case of being taken forcibly by the dress, the hand or the hair (lit. head) the woman should be softened even after observing the guilt [of the beloved person].</p>
<p>279. When taken by her hand, dress or hair the woman drawing near the beloved one should slowly release herself from him.</p>
<p>280. When taken by her hair, hand or dress the woman should enjoy (lit. take) the touch of the beloved in such a way that he may not perceive it.</p>
<p>281. The woman should slowly release her hair [from the hands of the beloved one] by standing first on her toes with limbs bent and then taking to the Aśvakrāntā posture.<sup id="fnref:146"><a href="#fn:146" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">146</a></sup></p>
<p>282. Her hair being not released [due to efforts of the beloved one] the woman should slightly perspire on his touch and say “<em>Hum hum</em>, let [my hairs] go,” and “Go away”.</p>
<p>283. After hearing the angry words like “Go away” the lover (lit. man) should [first] go away and then come back to start talking to her on any pretext.</p>
<p>284. Then the woman should make movements of her hand while uttering “<em>Huṃ huṃ</em>”, and during these movements she should pretend [anger] with abuses (<em>śapatha</em>).</p>
<p>285. In case of her clothes being taken away [by the beloved one] the woman should either cover his eyes, conceal herself behind his back and cover her Nīvi.</p>
<p>286. A woman should harass her [offending] lover till he would fall to her feet; but on his falling at her feet she should look to the female Messenger.</p>
<p>287-288. Then the Heroine should embrace the beloved one and with the object of intercourse she should joyfully walk [with him] to the bed. All these should be represented [only] by [appropriate] songs<sup id="fnref:147"><a href="#fn:147" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">147</a></sup> with a gentle dance.</p>
<p>288-289. When in a play there is any speaking to the sky or any action depending on another man’s speech, which relates to the Erotic Sentiment, then the same line of representation should be followed by a woman.</p>
<p>290. The same should be the rule of representation if an action of a play relates to the inner apartment (harem) and the Erotic Sentiment.</p>
<h2 id="acts-forbidden-on-the-stage"><em>Acts forbidden on the stage</em></h2>
<p>291. One knowing the dramatic convention (<em>nāṭya</em> - <em>dharma</em>) should not represent sleeping on the stage. But if [such is necessary] on some pretended need one should bring the Act to a close.</p>
<p>292-293. If out of any necessity anyone sleeps alone or with anyone, no kiss or embrace or any other private acts such as biting, scratching with nails, loosening the Nīvi, the pressing of breasts and lips, should be presented on the stage.<sup id="fnref:148"><a href="#fn:148" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">148</a></sup></p>
<p>294. Taking food or sporting in water or doing any immodest act should not be presented on the stage.</p>
<p>295.<sup id="fnref:149"><a href="#fn:149" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">149</a></sup> As a Nāṭaka is to be witnessed by the father and the son, the mother-in-law and the daughter-in-law [all sitting together] these acts should be carefully avoided.</p>
<p>296. With words which are very pleasant to hear and have not very harsh sounds and are sweet and not very cruel the experts should write Nāṭakas which are to contain good counsels.</p>
<h2 id="endearing-terms-of-address-for-the-beloved-one"><em>Endearing terms of address for the beloved one</em></h2>
<p>297. Now listen about terms which women in love are to use to their beloved ones when the Amorous Union takes place.</p>
<p>298.<sup id="fnref:150"><a href="#fn:150" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">150</a></sup> Such terms are “dear” (<em>priya</em>), “beloved” (<em>kānta</em>), “affectionate” (<em>vinīta</em>), “lord” (<em>nātha</em>), “master” (<em>svāmi</em>), “life” (<em>jīvita</em>) and “joy” (<em>nandana</em>) when they are pleased.</p>
<h2 id="angry-terms-of-address-for-the-beloved-one"><em>Angry terms of address for the beloved one</em></h2>
<p>299.<sup id="fnref:151"><a href="#fn:151" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">151</a></sup> In case of anger, terms generally used may be “ill-natured” (<em>duḥśīla</em>), “tyrant” (<em>durācāra</em>, lit. ill-doing), “deceitful” (<em>śaṭha</em>), “hostile” (<em>vāma</em>), “indifferent” (<em>virūpa</em>), “shameless” (<em>nirlajja</em>) and “cruel” (<em>niṣṭhura</em>).</p>
<h2 id="endearing-terms-of-address"><em>Endearing terms of address</em></h2>
<p>300. He who does nothing undesirable, speaks nothing improper, and always conducts himself uprightly is called “dear” (<em>priya</em>).</p>
<p>301. He in whose lips or [other parts of] the body no sign of Amorous Union with another woman is visible is called “beloved”<sup id="fnref:152"><a href="#fn:152" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">152</a></sup>.</p>
<p>302. He who even in his anger does not cross words [with the woman he loves] and does not use any harsh word is called “affectionate”.</p>
<p>303. He who maintains an intercourse with a woman by sweet words (<em>sāma</em>, lit. conciliation), gifts (<em>dāna</em>), providing enjoyment, caress and maintinance, is called “lord”<sup id="fnref:153"><a href="#fn:153" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">153</a></sup>.</p>
<p>304. He who is a well-wisher [of his beloved woman], is able to protect her, is not conceited or jealous, is always alert on every occasion, is called “master”<sup id="fnref:154"><a href="#fn:154" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">154</a></sup>.</p>
<p>305. He who takes the woman to the bed to please her tactfully by [providing] enjoyments according to her wishes and desires, is called “life”<sup id="fnref:155"><a href="#fn:155" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">155</a></sup>.</p>
<p>306. He who is high-born, patient, clever, kind, master of words and fit to be praised among women friends, is called “joy”<sup id="fnref:156"><a href="#fn:156" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">156</a></sup>.</p>
<p>307. These words are used to heighten the charm of intercourse. I shall now speak of words which indicate an want of love. Listen about them.</p>
<h2 id="angry-terms-of-address-explained"><em>Angry terms of address explained</em></h2>
<p>308. He who is cruel, impatient, conceited, shameless, bragging, given to crossing words, is called “ill-natured” (<em>duḥśīla</em>)<sup id="fnref:157"><a href="#fn:157" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">157</a></sup>.</p>
<p>309. He who restrains indiscreetly a woman’s movement or beats her or uses harsh words to her, is called a “tyrant”<sup id="fnref:158"><a href="#fn:158" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">158</a></sup>.</p>
<p>310. He who for his own purpose speaks sweet words but does not put them into practice is called “deceitful”<sup id="fnref:159"><a href="#fn:159" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">159</a></sup>.</p>
<p>311. He who even being forbidden to do anything does that very thing, and resolutely, is called “hostile”<sup id="fnref:160"><a href="#fn:160" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">160</a></sup>.</p>
<p>312. He who has fresh wounds [received from a another woman] and is proud of it and remains silent is called “indifferent”<sup id="fnref:161"><a href="#fn:161" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">161</a></sup>.</p>
<p>313. He who approaches the woman more resolutely than ever even when he is guilty [towards her] and bears the marks of such a guilt and is forbidden to approach, is called “shameless”<sup id="fnref:162"><a href="#fn:162" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">162</a></sup>.</p>
<p>314. He who being guilty towards her tries to enjoy a intercourse with a woman by force, and does not think of conciliating her, is called “cruel”<sup id="fnref:163"><a href="#fn:163" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">163</a></sup>.</p>
<p>315. These are the ways of using words to indicate whether a lover is dear or not so. In different circumstances<sup id="fnref:164"><a href="#fn:164" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">164</a></sup> one should use them discretely<sup id="fnref1:164"><a href="#fn:164" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">164</a></sup>.</p>
<p>316. In songs [mentioning such a situation] there should be application of gentle dance of the Erotic Sentiment and the [representation of] fatiguing acts of love.</p>
<p>317. When there is a man in the sky alluding to another person, and his word suggests the Erotic Sentiment, the same should be the mode of representation [on the part of a woman].</p>
<p>318. These should also be the procedure when a [similar] act relating to the Erotic Sentiment takes place in a Nāṭaka, with regard to a male.</p>
<p>319. This is the rule about the representation of incidents relating to the harem. I shall now describe in due order the rules regarding the goddesses (lit. celestial females).</p>
<h2 id="goddesses-in-human-roles"><em>Goddesses in human roles</em></h2>
<p>320. The dress of goddesses is always brilliant, their mind is always full of joy and their time is always passed happily and in sports.</p>
<p>321. Celestial males have no jealousy, anger and malice in life, and they require no propitiation of their females.</p>
<p>322. When celestial women unite with human beings they are to assume all the Psychological States of a mortal.</p>
<p>323. When celestial women sustain a fall [from the heaven] due to a curse, their union with human males and the mode of approach should be likewise.</p>
<p>324. [Remaining] invisible, she should tempt them with her voice and with [the scent of] flowers in her decoration and then revealing herself for a moment she should disappear.</p>
<p>325. The Hero is to be maddened by a display of dresses, ornaments, garlands and letters and such other means.</p>
<p>326. Love growing out infatuation will be pleasing, and that [love] which is natural will not cause such abundant feelings.</p>
<p>327. Being reduced to human existence celestial males should assume all the Psychological States which arc proper for men and should behave like them.</p>
<p>328. This should be the practice in connexion with kingly Etiquette in relation to the harem. The Etiquette in relation to the outsiders will be treated in rules regarding Courtezans (<em>vaiśika</em>).</p>
<p>Here ends Chapter XXIV of Bharata’s Nāṭyaśāstra which treats of the Harmonious Representation.</p>

From the contexts of this chapter as well as the def. given here in 72 below, it appears that the expression means harmonious use of the four kinds of abhinaya (VI. 23), and as such it should be distinguished from the citrābhinaya (XXVI.) which applies only to the special representation of various objects and ideas.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
