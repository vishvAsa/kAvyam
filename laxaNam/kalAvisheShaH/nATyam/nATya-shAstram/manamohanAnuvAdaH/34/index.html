  <p>1. I shall next speak of the salient features of characters, and of all the four kinds of Heroes in their essential aspect.</p>
<h2 id="three-types-of-character-in-a-play"><em>Three Types of Character in a Play</em></h2>
<p>2-3. Characters male and female [in a play], are in general of three types: superior, middling and inferior.</p>
<h3 id="a-superior-male-character"><em>A Superior Male Character</em></h3>
<p>3-4. [A man] who has controlled his senses, is wise, skilled<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> in various arts and crafts (<em>śilpa</em>), honest, expert in enjoyment,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> brings consolation to the poor, is versed in different Śāstras, grave, liberal, patient and munificent, is to be known as a ‘superior’ (<em>uttama</em>) [male]<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> character.</p>
<h3 id="a-middling-male-character"><em>A Middling Male Character</em></h3>
<p>4-5. [A man] who is an expert in the manners of people, proficient<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> in arts and crafts as well as in Śāstras, has wisdom, sweetness [of manners], is to be known as a ‘middling’ (<em>madhyama</em>) [male] character.</p>
<h3 id="inferior-male-characters"><em>Inferior Male Characters</em></h3>
<p>6-9. [Men] who are harsh in words, ill-mannered, low-spirited, criminally disposed,<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> irascible and violent, can kill friends, can kill anyone by torturing,<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> are prone to engage himself in useless things, speak very little, are mean, haughty in words, ungrateful, indolent, expert in insulting honoured persons, covetous of women, fond of quarrel, treacherous, doers of evil deeds, stealers of others’ properties, are to be known as ‘inferior’ (<em>adhama</em>) [male] characters. These are the three classes of male character according to their nature.</p>
<h3 id="a-superior-female-character"><em>A Superior Female Character</em></h3>
<p>10-12. I shall now speak in due order, of female characters. A woman who has a tender nature, is not fickle, speaks smilingly, is free from cruelty, attentive to words of her superiors, bashful, good-mannered, has natural beauty, nobility and such other qualities, and is grave and patient, is to be known as a ‘superior’ [female] character.</p>
<h3 id="a-middling-female-character"><em>A Middling Female Character</em></h3>
<p>12-13. A woman who does not possess these qualities to a great extent and always, and has some faults mixed with them, is to be known as a ‘middling’ [female] character.</p>
<h3 id="an-inferior-female-character"><em>An Inferior Female Character</em></h3>
<p>13-14. An ‘inferior’ female character is to be known in brief from an inferior male character.</p>
<h2 id="a-character-of-mixed-nature"><em>A Character of Mixed Nature</em></h2>
<p>14-16. Maid servants and the like are characters of mixed nature. A hermaphrodite is also a mixed character, but of the inferior kind. O the best of Brahmins, the Śakāra[^mg7] and the Viṭa<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> and others [like them] in a drama, are also to be known as characters of mixed nature.</p>
<p>So much about the characters which may be male, female or hermaphrodite.</p>
<h2 id="four-classes-of-hero"><em>Four Classes of Hero</em></h2>
<p>17-18. I shall now describe their classes according to their conduct. Among these, Heroes (<em>nāyaka</em>) are known to be of four classes, and they belong to the superior and the middling types and have various characteristics.</p>
<p>18-19. The Hero is described as being of four kinds: the self-controlled and vehement (<em>dhīroddhata</em>), the self-controlled and light-hearted (<em>dhīralalita</em>), the self-controlled and exalted (<em>dhīrodātta</em>) and self-controlled and calm (<em>dhīrapraśānta</em>).</p>
<p>19-21. Gods are self-controlled and vehement, kings are self-controlled and light-hearted, ministers are self-controlled and exalted, and Brahmins and merchants are self-controlled and calm Heroes.</p>
<h2 id="the-four-classes-of-jesters"><em>The Four Classes of Jesters</em></h2>
<p>21-22. To these again belong the four classes of Jesters. They are Sannyāsins, Brahmins, other twice-born castes and disciples, in cases respectively of gods, kings, ministers (<em>amātya</em>) and Brahmins.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
<p>These should be friends during [the Heroe’s] separation [from the beloved one], and experts in conversation.</p>
<h2 id="the-hero"><em>The Hero</em></h2>
<p>23. In case of many male characters in a play, one who being in misfortune or distress, ultimately attains elevation, is called the Hero.</p>
<p>24. And when there are more than one of such description, one whose misfortune and elevation are prominent, should be called the Hero.</p>
<h2 id="four-classes-of-heroine"><em>Four Classes of Heroine</em></h2>
<p>25-27. These [four] are always Heroes in dramatic works (lit. poetical compositions). I shall now speak of Heroines who [also] are of four classes: a goddess, a queen, a woman of high family, and a courtezan. These according to their characteristics, are of various kinds, such as self-controlled (<em>dhīrā</em>), light-hearted (<em>lalitā</em>), exalted (<em>udāttā</em>) and modest (<em>nibhṛtā</em>).</p>
<p>27-28. Goddesses and king’s women possess all these qualities. Women of high family, are exalted and modest, while a courtezan and a crafts-woman may be exalted and light-hearted.</p>
<h2 id="two-classes-of-employment-for-characters"><em>Two Classes of Employment for Characters</em></h2>
<p>29-30. The characters [in a play] have two kinds of of employment: external (<em>bāhya</em>) and internal (<em>ābhayantara</em>). I shall now speak of their characteristics.</p>
<p>[The character] which has dealings with the king, is an internal employee, and one who has dealings with the [people] outside, is an external employee.</p>
<h2 id="female-inmates-of-the-harem"><em>Female Inmates of the Harem</em></h2>
<p>31-34. I shall now describe the classes and functions of women<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> who have dealings with the king. They are the chief queen (<em>mahādevī</em>), other queens (<em>devī</em>), other highborn wives (<em>svāminī</em>), ordinary wives (<em>sthāyinī</em>),<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> concubines (<em>bhoginī</em>), crafts-women (<em>śilpakāriṇī</em>), actresses (<em>nāṭakīyā</em>),<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> dancers (<em>nartakī</em>), maids in constant attendance (<em>anucārikā</em>), maids of special work (<em>paricārikā</em>), maids in constant movement (<em>sañcārikā</em>), maids for running errands (<em>preṣaṇa-cārikā</em>), Mahattarīs (matrons), Pratihārīs (ushers) and maidens (<em>kumārī</em>) and Sthavirās (old dames) and Āyuktikās (female overseers).</p>

<p>64-66. Women who are in charge of stores, weapons,<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> and fruits, roots and grains, who examine the food [cooked for the king], and are in charge of [lit. thinkers of] scents, ornaments and garlands and clothes [he is to use], and who are employed for various [other] purposes, are called Āyuktīkās (female overseer).<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> These in brief are the different classes women of the [royal] harem.</p>

Those who have learning, truthfulness, are free from sexual passion, and have deep knowledge and wisdom, are known as Kañcukīyas.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> The king should employ them in business connected with polity. And the Varṣadharas should be employed in errands relating to love-affairs. And the Aupasthāyika-nirmuṇḍas are to be employed in escorting women, and in guarding maidens and girls. In bestowing honour to women the king should employ the maids in constant attendance.</p>
<h3 id="the-nāṭakīyā"><em>The Nāṭakīyā</em></h3>
<p>78-79. Women in the royal harem who attend all the movements of the king, should be employed, when they are proficient in performing all classes of dance, in the [royal] theatre under the authority of the harem.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup></p>

I shall speak of their classes and characteristics. Please listen about them.</p>
<h3 id="the-king"><em>The King</em></h3>
<p>84-88. The king should be intelligent, truthful, master of his senses, clever, and of good character, and he should possess a good memory; and be powerful, high-minded and pure, and he should be far-sighted, greatly energetic, grateful, skilled in using sweet words; he should take a vow of protecting people and be an expert in the methods of [different] work, alert, without carelessness, and be should associate with old people, and be well-versed in the Arthasāstra and the practice of various policies, a promoter of various arts and crafts, and an expert in the science of polity, and should have a liking for this, [Besides these] he should know his actual position, prosperity and its decline, and the weak points of his enemies, and [principles of] Dharma, and be free from evil habits.</p>

<p>91. Those who are high-born, intelligent, well-versed in Śruti and polity, fellow-countrymen [of the king], devoted [to him], free from guile (lit. pure) and followers of Dharma, should be chaplains and ministers, for these qualities of them.<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="courtiers"><em>Courtiers</em></h3>
<p>98. Members of the court (<em>sabhāstāra</em>)<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup> should be appointed by practical people according to the views of Brhaspati<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup> after taking note of the [various] qualities of these (<em>i.e.</em>, ministers etc.).</p>
<p>99. These are the characteristics of various characters, [in a play], that I was to say. I shall next speak of the characteristics of [persons suited to] various roles.</p>
<p>Here ends Chapter XXXIV of Bharata’s Nāṭyaśāstra, which treats of the Types of Different Characters.</p>

<p>The text here is corrupt, The reading bhogadakṣā is suggested on the assumption that a superior male character controlling his senses should not invariably be an ascetic, and he should be disposed to enjoy life legitimately.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

</li>
<li id="fn:4">
<p>If should be noticed that a superior male character should be skilled in various arts and crafts, while a middling male character should be proficient in these. The purpose of this distinction seems to be significant. A superior character should have knowledge of arts and crafts as an accomplishment, while the middling character should be capable of making a professional use of these for earning a livelihood. Saṃvāhaka (Mṛcch. II) who is a middling character, seems to support this view. About his practising massage, he says: Madam, I learnt it as an art. It has now become my profession (ajjae kaleti sikkhidā, ājīviā dāṇim saṃvuttā).&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>This gives us a very good glimpse of the royal harem in ancient India.&#160;<a href="#fnref:9" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>This passage shows that a king in ancient India, had a large number of wives. According to a Ceylon tradition, the king Bindusāra had sixteen wives. In Svapna. (VI. 9) Udayana refers to his mother-in-law Mahāsena’s chief queen as ṣoḍaśāntaḥpurajyeṣṭhā (being at the head of the sixteen wives).&#160;<a href="#fnref:10" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Bhāsa seems to disregard this rule. For Padmāvatī has no jealousy against Vāsavadattā (see Svapna.).&#160;<a href="#fnref:12" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:13">
<p>Perhaps for the personal safety of the king, male actors were not admitted in the theatre attached to the royal harem. The Bṛhatkathā-śloka-samgraha (II. 32, ed. Lacôte) testifies to the antiquity of this practice. In the palaces of the king of Cambodia and of some Sultans of Indonesia too, women only are engaged to produce plays. See Santidev Ghosh, Jāvā-O-Bālir Nṛtya-gīt (Bengali) Calcutta, 1952 p. 11.&#160;<a href="#fnref:13" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>From later dramas the Snātaka disappears altogether. Was Puṣyamitra described by S. Lévi as ‘a mayor of the palace,’ a Snātaka?&#160;<a href="#fnref:24" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Nirmuṇḍa or aupasthāyika-nirmuṇḍa probably meant one who had the head (muṇḍa) of his membrum virile (upastha) cut off.

<li id="fn:30">
<p>Amātya also has been used before to indicate a minister. But AŚ. (1. 8. 9.) distinguishes between amātya and mantrin. Kāmandakīya Nītisāra (VIII. 1) also does the same. According to the latter amātya seems to be identical with saciva (see IV. 25, 30, 31). According to Śukranīti saciva, amātya and mantrin are three different functionaries (See II. 94, 95 and 103). The Rudradāman inscription seems to distinguish between mantrin and saciva.&#160;<a href="#fnref:30" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>B. reads the passage differently. In translation it is as follows: “Those who are high-born, intelligent, well-versed in various Śāstras, affectionate [to the king], incorruptible by enemies, not haughty, the compatriot [of the king], free from greed, disciplined, trust-worthy, and virtuous are to be made chaplains and ministers.” The taking together of the chaplain and the minister probably shows that at one time the same person discharged the functions of the two.&#160;<a href="#fnref:33" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Vyāsa (smṛti) mentions sabhāstāra who should hold discourse about morals (dharmavākya) for the edification of those who are present [in the court]. In Mbh 4. 1. 24 however the sabhāstāra appears only as a courtier (sabhya Nīlakaṇṭha) who is particularly interested in gambling. Jolly, Hindu Law and Customs, pp. 287-288. Viṣṇudharmasūtra first speaks of the qualification of sabhāsadas who were probably the king’s helpers in the administration of justice. N. C.

<p>That the author of the NŚ. like the authors of the AŚ. refers to Bṛhaspati, probably shows that they were not very widely separated in time. Vātsyāyana, Mbh.
