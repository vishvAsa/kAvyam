<p>17-26. Now listen about their definition and uses.</p>
<p>Patāka (flag)—the fingers extended and close against one another, and the thumb bent.</p>
<p>(Uses): To represent an administration of blows, scorching heat, urging, attainment of happiness and arrogant reference of one’s ownself<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> this hand is to be raised on a level with the forehead. To represent the glare of heat, torrential rain and shower of flowers two Patāka hands with the fingers separated and moving, are to be joined together. A shallow pool of water, present of flowers, grass and any design [lit. object] made on the ground are to be represented by two such hands separated from the Svastika position. The same Patāka hands with their fingers pointing downwards are to be used to represent anything closed, made open, protected, covered, dense or private (to be concealed). This very hand with its fingers pointing downwards and moving up and down, is to express the speedy movement of wind and [ocean] waves, [ocean waves] breaking against the shore, and an objection. The Recaka of this hand should be used to represent encouragement, many [in number], a great crowd of men, height, beating of drums, and flight of birds upwards. And anything washed, pressed, cleansed, pounded, or holding up a hill or uprooting it, should be represented by the palms of two such hands rubbing each other. This is also the manner of representing man and woman.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>
<p>26-32. Tripatāka (flag with three fingers)—the third finger of the Patāka hand to be bent.</p>
<p>(Uses): It is to be used in representing invocation, descent, bidding goodbye, prohibition, entrance, raising up [anything],<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> bowing [in salutation], comparing,<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> suggesting alternatives, touching [the head with] auspicious objects or putting them on the head, putting on a turban or a crown and covering the mouth or the ears. This very hand with its fingers pointing downwards and moving up and down is to be used in representing flight of small birds, stream, snake, bees and the like. And with the third finger of the Tripatāka should be represented wiping off tears, drawing a Tilaka or Patralekhā<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> and touching of hairs.</p>
<p>32-37. Two Tripatāka<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> hands held like a Svastika represent adoration of the feet of venerable persons (<em>guru</em>)<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. Two such hands are to meet each other’s end for representing marriage. Separated and moved to the forehead they indicate a king. When obliquely forming a Svastika they represent planets. To indicate an ascetic they arc to be raised with palm turned forward. To represent a door they are to face each other. Submarine fire, battle and sea-monsters are to be indicated by two Tripatāka hands, first raised near one’s face and then moved with the fingers pointing downwards. With these very hands should be indicated jumping of monkeys, waves, wind and women. To show the crescent moon this hand should put forward its thumb, and to indicate a king’s march [against his enemy] this hand should turn itself towards the back.</p>
<p>38-40. Kartarīmukha (scissors’ blades)—the forefinger of the Tripatāka hand is to bend backwards.</p>
<p>(Uses): This [hand with its fingers] pointing downwards will represent showing the way, decorating the feet<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> or dying them,<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> and the crawling [of babies]. With fingers pointing upwards it will represent biting, horn and letters. And when the fingers in it are turned differently (<em>i.e</em>. the middle finger is bent backwards) it will represent falling down, death, transgression,<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> reversion, cogitation and putting [anything] in trust.</p>
<p>42. And with the two such (<em>saṃyuta</em>) hands or one such (<em>asaṃyuta</em>) hand should be represented an antelope, yak, buffalo, celestial elephant (<em>airāvata</em>), bull, gate (<em>gogūra</em>) and hill-top.</p>
<p>42-44. Ardhacandra (crescent moon)—the fingers and the thumb so bent as to make a curve like a bow.</p>
<p>(Uses): With this should be represented young trees, crescent moon, conch shell, jar (<em>kalaśa</em>), bracelet, forcible opening, exertion,<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> thinness and drinking. With this [very] Ardhacandra hand women should represent girdle, hip waist, face, Tālapatra<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> and earring.</p>
<p>45-50. Arala (bent)—the forefinger curved like a bow, the thumb also curved and the remaining fingers separated and turned upwards.</p>
<p>(Uses): With this should be represented courage, pride, prowess, beauty, contentment, heavenly [objects], poise, act of blessing and other favourable states. And this, again, will represent woman’s gathering of hairs or scattering them and looking carefully over their entire body. The preliminaries to the marriage by bride’s going round the bridegroom<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> and [marital] union<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> are to be represented by two Arāla hands moving around each other and their fingers meeting in the form of a Svastika. And with similar hands should be represented circumambulation, round objects, great crowd of men, objects arranged on the ground.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> In calling any one, in making offering to the manes, saying too many things, in censure and rebuke etc., wiping off sweat and enjoying sweet smell, the Tripatāka hands have been prescribed before by me, but women are to use the Arāla hand to represent these.</p>
<p>51-53. Śukatuṇḍa (parrot’s beak)—the ring-finger (third finger) of the Arāla hand is bent.</p>
<p>(Uses): With this should be represented words such as ‘(It is) not I’, ‘(It is) not you’, (It should) not be done, invocation, farewell, and saying ‘Fie (upon you)’ in contempt.</p>
<p>54-55. Muṣṭi (fist—fingers have their ends [bent] into the palm and the thumb [is set] upon them.</p>
<p>(Uses): It is used to represent beating, exercise<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> exit, pressing,<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> shampooing,<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> grasping sword and holding spears and clubs.</p>
<p>56-57. Śikhara (peak)—in this very hand (<em>muṣṭi</em>) the thumb raised.</p>
<p>(Uses): It is used to represent reins, whip, goad, bow, throwing a javelin (<em>tomara</em>) or a spike *(<em>śakti</em>), painting the two lips and feet and raising up hairs.</p>
<p>58-59. Kapittha (elephant-apple)—the forefinger of the Śikhara hand to be bent and pressed by the thumb.</p>
<p>(Uses): It is to represent weapons such as sword, bow, discus, javelin (<em>tomara</em>), spear (<em>kunta</em>), mace, spike (<em>śakti</em>), thunderbolt and arrows, true and wholesome deeds.</p>
<p>60-63. Kaṭakāmukha—the ring-finger and the little finger of this Kapittha hand to be raised and bent.</p>
<p>(Uses): It is used to represent sacrifice,[^mg27] oblation,[^mg28] umbrella, drawing up reins, fan, holding a mirror, drawing [patterns],[^mg29] powdering, taking up big sticks, arranging a pearl necklace, wearing garlands, gathering the ends of clothes, churning, drawing out arrows, plucking flowers, wielding a long whip, drawing out a goad, a rope, and representing a woman.</p>
<p>65-71. Sūcīmukha—the fore finger of the Kaṭakāmukha hand to be stretched.</p>
<p>(Uses): I shall tell you briefly of its various uses as the forefinger [in it] is raised and bent, moving sideways, shaking, moving up and down, and moving up without any rest. By moving the forefinger upwards [in this hand] are to be represented discus, lightning, banners, blossoms, earring,<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup> zigzag movement, a cry of approbation,<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> young serpent, young sprout,<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> incense, lamp, creepers,<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup> Śikhaṇḍa,<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup> falling down, curve and roundness and with the forefinger raised this [hand] again should be used in [representing] stars, nose, [the number] one, club and stick. And [this hand with the forefinger] bent should meet the mouth to represent a being with teeth, and by the circular movement of this hand one should represent the taking away [a man’s] everything. And the forefinger in this hand should be quite near the eats in yawning, and by the mouth lowered to represent long study and long day. And the same should be curved near the face to represent a sentence. And to indicate ‘no’ or ‘speak’ the forefinger should be stretched, shaken and moved up.</p>
<p>72-75. This hand should be shaken to represent anger, perspiration, hair, ear-ring, armlet and decoration of the cheeks.

<p>152. The two kinds of hands (single and combined) described briefly may be used elsewhere also in conformity with the rules laid down here.</p>
<h2 id="general-rules-regarding-the-use-of-hand-gestures"><em>General rules regarding the use of hand gestures</em></h2>
<p>153. In acting, hand [gestures] should be selected for their form, movement, significance, and class according to the personal judgement [of the actor].</p>
<p>154. There is no gesture (lit. hand) that cannot be used in indicating [some] idea. I have profusely described whatever forms (lit. gestures) are usually seen [to be associated with different ideas].</p>
<p>155. There are besides other popular gestures (lit. hand) connected with other ideas, and they also are to be freely used along with the movements inspired by the Sentiments and the States.</p>
<p>156. These gesture? should be used by males as well as females with proper regard to place, occasion, the play undertaken and a suitability of their meaning.</p>
<h2 id="different-movements-of-hand-gestures"><em>Different movements of hand gestures</em></h2>
<p>I shall now describe the varied movements which these gestures (lit. hands) [should] have in connexion with [different] Sentiments and States.</p>
<p>158-160. [These movements are]: drawing upwards, dragging, drawing out, accepting, killing, beckoning, urging, bringing together, separating, protecting, releasing, throwing, shaking, giving away, threatening, cutting, piercing, squeezing and beating.</p>
<p>161. Hand gestures according to the theory of Histrionic Representation are to have three kinds of general movements, viz. upwards, sideways and downwards.</p>
<p>162. These movements of hands should at the time of their use, be embellished by means of [suitable] expressions in the eyes, the eyebrows and the face,</p>
<h2 id="spheres-of-hand-gestures"><em>Spheres of hand gestures</em></h2>
<p>163. The experts are to use the hand gestures according to the popular practice and, [in this matter] they should have an eye to their movement, object, sphere, quantity, appropriateness and mode.</p>
<p>164. Hand gestures of persons of the superior type should move near their forehead, that of the middling type of persons at about their breasts while the inferior persons [should move their hand gestures in regions] below this.</p>
<h2 id="quantity-of-gestures"><em>Quantity of gestures</em></h2>
<p>165. In the superior persons, hand gestures should have scanty movement, in the middling ones there should be medium movement, while in the acting of the ordinary persons, there should be profuse movements of hand gestures.</p>
<p>166. For relevant purposes the hand gestures of persons of the superior and the middling types should conform the definition given [in the Śāstra] while gestures of persons of the inferior type should follow the popular practice and their [own] natural habit.</p>
<p>167. But when [specially] different occasions or times present themselves, wise people should make contrary uses of the hand gestures.</p>
<p>168-171. While a person is to represent himself as sad, fainting, terrified, overcome with disgust or sorrow, weak, asleep, handless, inactive, drowsy, inert, sick, attacked with fever, seized with panic, attacked with cold, intoxicated, bewildered, mad, thoughtful, practising austerities, residing in a cold region, prisoner under arrest, running very swiftly, speaking in dream, suddenly moving away and bursting nails he is not to use hand gestures, but he should resort to the Sāttvika Representation as well as to the change of voice suitable to the different States and Sentiments.</p>
<p>172. At the time of verbal acting (<em>i.e</em>. when the actor will speak his part) the eyes and the look are to be directed to points at which the hand gestures are moving, and there should be proper stops so that the meaning may be [clearly] expressed (lit. seen).¹</p>
<p>173. These are the hand gestures connected with the various kinds of Histrionic Representations. I shall now speak of Dance-hands (<em>i.e</em>. gestures to be used in dance).</p>
<h2 id="dance-hands-nṛttahasta-">*Dance-hands (nṛttahasta) *</h2>
<p>174. Caturasra—two Kaṭakāmukha hands held forward eight Aṅgulīs away [from one’s chest,] the two shoulders and elbows on the same level.</p>
<p>175. Udvṛtta—the two Haṃsapakṣa hands waved like a palm-leaf (fan). Its alternative name is the Tālavṛnta (palm-leaf).</p>
<p>176. Talamukha—the two hands from the Caturasra position to be held obliquely facing each other.</p>
<p>177. Svastika—the Talamukha hands crossed at the wrists; but released after this they are called Viprakīrṇa.</p>
<p>178. Arālakhaṭakāmukha—the two Alapallava (Alapadmaka) hands with palms upwards changed into Padmakośa hands. Its another name is Arālakaṭaka.</p>
<p>179. Āviddhavakraka—The two hands are to have a graceful (<em>kuṭila</em>) movement after touching [successively] the opposite shoulder, elbow and hands, and the palms [of the hands] moved are to turn towards the back.</p>
<p>180. Sūcīmukha—The two Sarpaśiraḥ hands with their thumbs touching middle fingers are to stretch their tips obliquely.</p>
<p>181. Recita—the two Haṃsapakṣa hands swiftly moving with the palms facing upward. This is like the ordinary Recita [of the hands].</p>
<p>182. Ardharecita—The left hand should be as in the Caturasra and the right hand as in the Recita.</p>
<p>183. Uttānavañcita—The two Tripatāka hands are slightly bent obliquely and the shoulders and the elbows are moved.</p>
<p>184. Pallava—the two Patāka hands joined at the wrist.</p>
<p>Nitamba—the two Patāka hands taken out from the boulder [to the hip].</p>
<p>185. Keśabandha—the two hands moved out from the hair-knot (<em>keśabandha</em>) and held on the sides.</p>
<p>186. Latā—the two hands to be obliquely stretched sideways.</p>
<p>187. Karihasta—the Latā hand held up and swung from side to side and the Tripatāka hand held on the ear.</p>
<p>188. Pakṣavañcitaka—one Tripatāka hand placed on the waist and another on the head.</p>
<p>189. Pakṣapradyotaka—the Pakṣavañcitaka hands changing places (<em>i.e</em>. the hands placed on the waist to be put on the head and <em>vice versa</em>).</p>
<p>190. Daṇḍapaksa—the two Haṃsapakṣa hands moved alternately and then held out like a staff.</p>
<p>191. Ūrdhvamaṇḍalī—the two hands to have circling movement near the upper region (<em>i.e</em>. the upper part of the body).</p>
<p>Pārśvamaṇḍalī—the same movement made on one side.</p>
<p>192. Uromaṇḍalī—after circling movements one hand to be raised up and the other to hang down, and movements to take place near the breast.</p>
<p>193. Uraḥpārśvārdhamaṇḍala—the Alapallava (Alapadmaka) and Arāla hands moved by turns above the chest and by the sides.</p>
<p>194. Muṣṭikasvastika—the two Kaṭakāmukha hands bent at the wrists and moved round.</p>
<p>195. Nalinīpadmakośa—the hands to be moved by turns with Vyavartita and Parivartita Karaṇa.</p>
<p>196. Alapallava—the two hands to have the Udveṣṭita Karaṇa in their movements.</p>
<p>Ulbaṇa—the two hands to be stretched up and waved.</p>
<p>197. Lalita—two [Ala]-pallava (Alapadmaka) hands to be moved above the head.</p>
<p>Valita—the two Latā hands crossed at their elbows.</p>
<h2 id="dance-hands"><em>Dance hands</em></h2>
<p>198. The Dance-hands are to be used in forming Karaṇas, and hands such as the Patāka should be used in representing the meaning [of words].</p>
<p>199. [But] sometimes, out of necessity their uses are inter-changed, and the names given are due to their predominant use in drama and dance.</p>
<p>200. The Dance-hands are of two kinds: single and combined. I shall now speak of hands in relation to the Karaṇas.<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="karaṇas-of-dance-hands"><em>Karaṇas of Dance hands</em></h2>
<p>201-202. Instructors of hand gestures are to note carefully the four classes into which all such gestures are grouped. The four classes are: Āveṣṭita, Udveṣṭita, Vyavarita and Parivartita.</p>
<p>203. Āveṣṭita: When the fingers beginning with the first one (the forefinger) are gradually pointing inwards at the time [the hand] moves round, the Karaṇa [thus produced] is called Āveṣṭita.</p>
<p>204. Udveṣṭita: When the fingers beginning with the first one [forefingers] are gradually pointing outwards at the time [the hand] moves round, the Karaṇa thus produced is called Udveṣṭita.</p>
<p>205. Vyavartita: When fingers beginning with the last one (the little finger) are gradually pointing inwards at the time [the hand] moves round, the Karaṇa thus produced is called Vyavartita.</p>
<p>206. Parivartita: When the fingers beginning with the last one (the little finger) are gradually pointing outwards at the time [the hand] moves round, the Karaṇa thus produced, is called Parivartita.</p>
<p>207. Hand gestures in their [various] movements when applied in drama and dance should he followed by Karaṇas having [appropriate expression of] the face, the eyebrows and the eyes.</p>
<h2 id="movements-of-arms-bāhu-">*Movements of arms (bāhu) *</h2>
<p>208-209. Persons dealing in drama and dance have prescribed ten [movements] of arms: Tiryak, Ūrdhvagata, Adhomukha, Āviddha, Apaviddha, Maṇḍala, Svastika, Añcita, Kuñcita and Pṛṣṭhaga.</p>
<p>210. O Brahmins, I have now finished the brief description of rules regarding the Karaṇas and shall speak afterwards about the movements of the breast, the belly and the sides.</p>
<p>Here ends Chapter IX of Bharata’s Nāṭyaśāstra, which treats of the Gestures of Hands.</p>

<li id="fn:1">
<p>This use relates to the two-fold Practice (realistic and coventional) on the stage (See XIV. 62ff). The Realistic Practice (lokadharmī) in this connexion is of two kinds, viz. (1) that reflecting one’s emotion, as in arrogant reference to one’s ownself, this (patāka) hand is to be raised on a level with the forehead (IX. 19), (2) that representing the external form of an object, as the use of the Padmakośa hand to represent lotus and similar flowers. The Conventional Practice (nāṭyadharmī) is likewise of two kinds, viz, (1) that creating an ornamental effect, as the use of the four karaṇas of the hand (See IX. 205-211 below), (2) that partially suggesting a popular behaviour, as the use of the tṛipatāka hand to represent words spoken aside (janāntika).

<p>These hands gestures are ordinarily used singly; but at times two hands showing one of these gestures are used simultaneously. But still these are called single (asaṃyuta) hands.

<p>These gestures (dance-hands, nṛttahasta) as their name implies, are ordinarily to be used in dance; but in course of acting too they are often to be used along with other gestures (single and combined) to create an ornamental effect (See note 1 to 1-3 above).

<p>In the Skt. text these names are given in dual number e.g. our caturasra stands as caturasrau. The reason for this is to be sought in the fact that unlike the single and combined hands which must represent one single idea or object, the hands in the dance-hand gestures are to be individually moved, not for representing any idea or object, but for creating an ornamental effect in acting as well as in dance.
