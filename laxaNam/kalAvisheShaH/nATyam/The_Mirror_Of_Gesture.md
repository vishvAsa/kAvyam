**THE MIRROR OF GESTURE**

**INTRODUCTION**

MR. GORDON CRAIG, who understands so well the noble artificiality of Indian dramatic technique, has frequently asked mefor more detailed information than is yet available in this toolong neglected field.

 "If there are books of technical instruction," writes Mr. Gordon Craig,"tell them to me I pray you. The day may come when I could afford tohave one or two translated for my own private study and assistance. Idread (seeing what it has already done in other arts here) the
influence ofthe finished article of the East; but Icravetheinstruction of the instructorsof the East. The disastrous effect the Chinese porcelain and the Japaneseprint has had on us in painting we must try to avoid in this theatre art. . . .You know how I reverence and love with all my best the miracles of yourland, but I dread for my men lest they go blind suddenly attempting to seeGod's face. You know well what I mean, I think. So I want to cautiouslyopen this precious and dangerous (only to us queer folk) book of technicalinstruction before the men go crazy over the lovely dancers of the King ofCambodia, before the 'quaintness' tickles them, before they see a shortcut to a sensation. If only you knew how unwilling these men of the theatre(most of all those dissatisfied with the old sloppy order) were to face theodds, and how they long to escape obligations (your phrase in 'Sati') youwould almost make a yearly tour of England crying 'Shun the East and themysteries of the East'."¹

 While we still lack a complete and adequate translation,and even a satisfactory edition, of the "Dramatic Science"*(Nāṭya Śāstra)* of Bharata, the present version of a shortercompendium known as the "Mirror of Gesture" *(AbhinayaDarpaṇa)* of Nandikeśvara may be of use as an introductionto Indian method.

 The dramatic scriptures of India were framed by Brahmā atthe request of the lesser gods, at the very beginning of the TretaYuga, the last aeon before the present. This event is describedas follows in the first chapter of the "Nāṭya Śāstra" of Bharata:  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1 Extract from a letter written in 1915.

 When Brahmā was a Sage in the Kṛta Age, and when Vaiśvata Manu waspreparing for the Treta Age, when popular morality is in the grasp of greedand of desire, and the world is deluded by envy, by resentment, and byweal and woe, when the Devas, Dānavas, Gandharvas, Yakṣas, Rākṣasas,Mahoragas, and the Lokapālas entered upon Jambu-dvīpa, then Indra andthe other Devas said to Brahmā: "We desire a pastime to be seen and heard.This matter of the Four Vedas should not be heard by Śūdras, pray therefore shape another and a fifth Veda for all the castes."

 Saying to them, "So let it be," and turning away from Indra, he whoknows the essence of every matter, seated in Yoga posture, called to hismind the Four Vedas, thinking, "Let me make a Fifth Veda, to be calledNāṭya (Drama), combined with epic story, tending to virtue, wealth, (pleasure and spiritual freedom), yielding fame—a concise instruction setting forthall the events of the world about to be, containing the significance of everyScripture, and forwarding every art." Thus, recalling all the Vedas, theBlessed Brahmā framed the Nāṭya Veda from the several parts of the FourVedas, as desired. From the Ṛg Veda he drew forth the words, from theSāma Veda the singing, from the Yajur Veda gesture, and from the AtharvaVeda the flavour.

 This science was communicated by Brahmā to Bharata and tohis hundred sons, and it was first used at the Flag Festival ofIndra, to celebrate the victory of the Devas in battle against theDānavas. When, however, the Dānavas found that the dramadepicted their own defeat, they remonstrated with Brahmā,and this afforded occasion for an explanation of the true characterand significance of dramatic art—not to flatter any party, butto represent the true and essential nature of the world. Brahmāexplains to the Dānavas:

 "This play is not merely for your pleasure or the pleasure of the Devas,but exhibits mood (*bhāva*) for all the Three Worlds. I made this playas following the movement of the world (*lokaṛt'-anukaraṇam*), whetherin work or play, profit, peace, laughter, battle, lust, or slaughter; yieldingthe fruit of righteousness to those who follow the moral law, pleasure to those who follow lust, a restraint for the unruly, a discipline for the followersof a rule, creating vigour in the impotent, zeal in warriors, wisdom in theignorant, learning in scholars, affording sport to kings, endurance to thesorrow-smitten, profit to those who seek advantage, courage to the brokenwilled; replete with the divers moods (*bhāvas*), informed with the varyingpassions of the soul, linked to the deeds of all mankind, the best, the middling,and the low, affording excellent counsel, pastime, weal and all else.

 This drama shall be the source of all counsel in matters of flavour (*rasa*),mood (*bhāva*), and every rite; it shall serve as a timely resting-place forthose who are grieved, weary, unhappy, or engaged in an arduous discipline;

bestowing righteousness, renown, long life, fortune, increase of reason; affording counsel to the world. That which is not to be found herein is notknowledge, nor craft, nor wisdom, nor any art, nor deeds, nor Union (*yoga*).

 I made this drama according to the Seven Lands, and so you should notfeel resentment towards the Immortals. The drama is to be understood aswitnessing the deeds of Gods and Titans, kings of the spheres, and Brahmāsages. Drama is that which accords with the order (*sva-bhāva*) of the world,with its weal and woe, and it consists in movements of the body and otherarts of expression (*abhinaya*). The theatre is such as to afford a means ofentertainment in the world, and a place of audience for the Vedas, for philosophy, for history, and other matters."

 He adds that no performance should be begun without fulfilling the Office of the Stage (*rangapūjaḥ*), and that those whoneglect this ritual will be ruined.

 In a following chapter Bharata explains, in connection withthe building of the theatre, how it is that the behaviour of theartist must of necessity be studied, and not impulsive; for thehuman actor, who seeks to depict the drama of heaven, is nothimself a god, and only attains to perfect art through consciousdiscipline: "All the activities of the gods, whether in house orgarden, spring from a natural disposition of the mind, but allthe activities of men result from the conscious working of thewill; therefore it is that the details of the actions to be done bymen must be carefully prescribed."

 Indian acting or dancing—the same word, Nāṭya, coversboth ideas—is thus a deliberate art. Nothing is left to chance;the actor no more yields to the impulse of the moment in gesturethan in the spoken word. When the curtain rises, indeed, it istoo late to begin the making of a new work of art.**¹**Precisely asthe text of the play remains the same whoever the actor may be,precisely as the score of a musical composition is not varied bywhomsoever it may be performed, so there is no reason why anaccepted gesture-language (*angikābhinaya*) should be variedwith a view to set off advantageously the actor's personality.It is the action, not the actor, which is essential to dramaticart. Under these conditions, of course, there is no room for anyamateur upon the stage; in fact, the amateur does not exist inOriental art.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**1** This general principle holds good even where an author acts his own play.

 Granting, of course, a variety of natural capacity, therenaturally appears to be less difference between the good and badactor than we are accustomed to observe in modern Europe,because the actor who merely exhibits *himself* is eliminated altogether. The difference, however, exists, and the Indian connoisseur is as sensitive to every shade of it as the western critic tothe wider range of variation on the European stage. The perfectactor has the same complete and calm command of gesture thatthe puppet showman has over the movements of his puppets;the exhibition of his art is altogether independent of his ownemotional condition, and if he is moved by what he represents,he is moved as a spectator, and not as an actor.**¹**Excellentacting wears the air of perfect spontaneity, but that is the artwhich conceals art. It is exactly the same with painting. TheAjaṇṭā frescoes seem to show unstudied gesture and spontaneouspose, but actually there is hardly a position of the hands or ofthe body which has not a recognized name and a precise significance. The more deeply we penetrate the technique of anytypical Oriental art, the more we find that what appears to beindividual, impulsive, and 'natural', is actually long-inherited,well-considered, and well-bred. Under these conditions lifeitself becomes a ritual. The Indian actor relies only to a verysmall extent on properties, and still less on scenery. Referringto this, Bābu Dinesh Chandra Sen remarks with justice of theBengālī Yātrās, that these folk-plays" without scenery, withoutthe artistic display of costumes, could rouse emotions whichnowadays we scarcely experience while witnessing semi-European performances given on the stages of the Calcuttatheatres."**²**

 But it is not merely in connection with folk-plays thataccessories are needless. Let us take a few episodes fromthe "Śakuntalā" of Kālidāsa and see how they are presented.The "Watering of a Tree" is to be acted according to the following direction: First show *Nalina*-*padmakośa* hands palmsdownwards, then raise them to the shoulder, incline the head,  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**2** "History of Bengali Language and Literature", 1911, p. 733.

somewhat bending the slender body, and pour out. *Nalinapadmakośa* hands are as follows: *Śukatuṇḍa* hands are crossedpalms down, but not touching, turned a little backward, andmade *Padmakośa*. To move the *Nalina-padmakośa* hands downwards is said to be 'pouring out'." The action indicated ispractically that of the extreme left-hand figure in Plate XII ofthe India Society's "Ajanta Frescoes" (Oxford, 1915), but theactress, of course, only makes believe to lift and pour, she doesnot make use of an actual vessel. "Showing Fear of a Bee" isto be acted as follows: "Move the head quickly to and fro(*Vidhutam*), the lips quivering, while *Patāka* hands are heldunsteadily against the face, palms inward." 'GatheringFlowers is to be acted as follows: "Hold the left handhorizontally in *Arāla*, the right hand in *Haṃsāsya*, extendedforward at the side." The left hand here represents abasket, and imaginary flowers are picked with the right handand transferred to the left. '' Mounting a Car " is to be shownas follows: " The knees are to be raised, the leg being bent andlifted, so that the knee is level with the chest, and there held;and then the same is done with the other foot."**¹**

 It should be noted throughout that the words *Nāṭya*, etc.,imply both acting and dancing; we have used the word 'dance'in our translation only for want of any English word combiningthe ideas of dancing and acting. The reader will go far astrayif he understands by dancing anything but rhythmic shewing.Indian acting is a poetic art, an interpretation of life, whilemodern European acting, apart from any question of the words,is prose, or imitation.

 It is needless to say that the appeal of the Indian actor's artcan only be felt by a cultivated audience; it is for this reasonthat it possesses so little interest for the ordinary European  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**1** Śukatuṇḍa, Padmakośa, Arāla and Haṃsāsya hands, and the Vidhuta headare explained in the text of the “Mirror of Gesture" translated below. The abovestage directions are from Rāghavabhatta's "Arthadyotanikā”, a commentary onŚakuntala, printed in the "Abhijñāna Śakuntalā” edited by Godabole and Paraba,Bombay, 1886. The immediate source is Sylvain Levi's well known and valuablework, "Le Théâtre Indien", which is, however, mainly concerned with the literature,rather than the technique of the Indian drama.

spectator, who remains from beginning to end of the performance—if he remains so long—an outsider. The Indian artist is aprofessional, and he works for an audience of unsparing critics.The fact that dancing or pantomime is a learned art appears inall the literature, and the accomplished actor must be accomplished in many things. In the “Mirror of Gesture", for example,the various definitions are constantly supported by the remark,"This is the view of those who are learned in the Bharatāgama."**¹**It must not be imagined on this account that Indian Nāṭyaserved or serves only for the entertainment of an academicclique. This may have been the case with the old court dramas,but it was not so with Nāṭyain general, which corresponded tothe common and collective need of the folk. Where such a needis felt, there arises a common and collective art, that is to say,an art which is not, indeed, practised by everyone, but is understood by everyone. The Indian actor, despite the apparentcomplexity of the gesture-language, makes no movement ofwhich the meaning is incomprehensible to an Indian audience,while the subject-matter—religious, epic, or erotic—is commonground for all. But the knowledge of technique and theme isnot alone sufficient, without imagination; and according to theIndian view, the power to experience aesthetic emotion is inborn,it cannot be acquired by mere study, being the reward of meritgained in a former life.**²** Whether or not this be true of the individual, it is certainly true of human communities, where no greatart ever yet sprang into being out of nothing in a single generation. Art, and the general understanding of art, are always theresult of a long, united, and consistently directed effort, andnothing can be done unless the artist and the spectator share acommon inspiration. How far this is assumed to be the case inIndia may be gathered from the remarks of the dramatic criticssuch as Dhanaṃjaya, who pours scorn upon the spectator whoseeks in drama the statement of fact rather than the experience.

of joy,**¹** and says that this experience depends upon the spectator's own capacities, and does not arise from the perfections ofthe hero, or because the work was deliberately designed to createa beautiful effect; it is their own effort by which the audienceis delighted, just as in the case of children playing with clayelephants, whose imagination bestows upon their toys a variedand abundant life.**²**Those who lack imagination are said to beno better than furniture, walls, or stones.**³**

 The old Indian dramatic art is no longer to be seen in Indiain a complete state.**⁴** The art of the modern Parsee theatres,chiefly exhibited in large towns such as Bombay and Calcutta, isonly nominally Indian. The scenery and costume are elaborate,incongruous, and tawdry; the music and the ballet hybrid; andthe acting, though generally clever, is ill-informed and unsensitive**.⁵** Authentic Indian acting, however, survives in the'Nautch', a form of dance which sets forth a given theme bymeans of song and gesture combined. Performances of this kinddo not correspond very closely to modern European conceptionsof the dance, which belong rather to what is called in India mere*Nṛtta*, rhythmic movement without a theme and therefore without "flavour." The Indian Nācnī (Nautch-girl, *bayadère*)generally exhibits an alternation of Nṛtta and Nṛtya. The latter,together with the sister art of music, must be regarded as representing the most perfect form of old Indian practical aestheticculture now surviving, and one of the most beautiful and moving arts that maintain a precarious existence in a world that is

thinking of something else." There are still innumerableIndian temples where the ritual dancing of Devadāsīs beforethe image is a part of the regular daily office; while inorthodox circles the Nautch is still an indispensable elementin all festivities such as weddings and coronations. The Nautchis a direct survival of the old Indian Nāṭya. But the materialof the classic drama is rarely if ever presented at the present day,the theme of the modern Nautch being most often Vaiṣṇava.The development of Nāṭyais thus analogous to that which hastaken place in painting and poetry.

 It may be remarked here that it is very usual for Indian singers,other than dancers, to accompany their singing with gesticulation.This is of two kinds, of which the first, quite distinct from whatis spoken of in the present treatise, is a hand movement reflectingthe musical form; this expression of empathy (*sādhāraṇī*) issometimes very impressive or graceful, but not less often grotesque. The second, known as *bhāv batānā* or ‘shewing moods' isof the type here described as *abhinaya*, or 'gesture' and differsfromNāṭyaonly in the greater relative importance of the musicand the words.

 Certain of the dance poses possess not merely a general linguistic, but also a special hieratic significance. These poses,chiefly of the hands, are spoken of as *mudrās* (seals), and aremore or less familiar to students of Hindū iconography. It is,however, scarcely realised how closely connected are the dancingand the sculpture. Many of the gods are themselves dancers, and,in particular, the everlasting operation of creation, continuance,and destruction—the Eternal Becoming, informed by All-pervading Energy—is marvellously represented in the dance of Śiva.^(**1**)He also exhibits dances of triumph and of destruction. Kālī, likewise, dances in the burning ground, which we understand tosignify the heart of the devotee made empty by renunciation.Śrī Krishna dances a dance of triumph following the victory over

Kāliya, and another General Dance, with the milkmaids of Brindāban, who are the souls of men.

 Most of the dances just mentioned, however, except the RāsaMaṇḍala or General Dance last spoken of, are Tāṇḍava dancesand represent a direct cosmic activity. Those of the Nṛtyaclass, which set forth in narrative fashion the activities of Godsand Titans, or exhibit the relationships of hero and heroine " Soas to reveal an esoteric meaning", are for the most part Lāsyadances performed by the Apsarās of Indra's paradise, and by theDevadāsīs and Nācnīs upon earth. It will be seen that in allcases the dance is felt to fulfil a higher end than that of mereentertainment: it is ethically justified upon the ground that itsubserves the Four Ends of life, and this view of Nāṭya is plainlystated in Tiruvenkaṭācāri's preface translated below. The artsare not for our instruction, but for our delight, and this delightis something more than pleasure, it is the godlike ecstasy ofliberation from the restless activity of the mind and the senses,which are the veils of all reality, transparent only when we areat peace with ourselves. From the love of many things weare led to the experience of Union: and for this reason Tiruvenkaṭācāri does not hesitate to compare the actor's or dancer's artwith the practice of Yoga. The secret of all art is self-forgetfulness.

 Side by side with this view, however, there has always existedin India a puritanical disparagement of the theatre, based upona hedonistic conception of the nature of aesthetic emotion; andthis party being now in full cry, and the Nautch, on the otherhand, being threatened by that hybridization which affects allthe arts of India that are touched by western influence, the oldIndian Nāṭya is not likely to survive for very much longer.Probably the art of the theatre will now first be revived in Europe,rather than in India.

 All that is said in the present volume will serve only as anintroduction to Indian dramatic technique and to Oriental acting in general. But we are encouraged to think that even sobrief an introduction to an extensive science may prove of practical value to the many dramatists who are interested in the future

of the European theatre; and though we have done all in ourpower to serve the ends of scholarship, our main purpose in publishing the "Mirror of Gesture'' is to interest and assist theliving actor—not that we suppose that it might be profitablefor him to adopt the actual gesture-language of the East, butthat it may inspire him with the enthusiasm and the patienceneedful for the re-creation of the drama in his own environment.

 It remains to be said that our translation is based upon aNāgarītranscript of the second Telugu edition of the “AbhinayaDarpaṇa" of Nandikeśvara, published under the editorship of thelate Tiruvenkaṭācāri of Niḍāmangalam. The translation isintended to be literal, but in the latter part, and occasionallyelsewhere, is somewhat compressed by the omission of wordsthat are not absolutely essential, or phrases that are constantlyrepeated, such as 'in the dance', 'this hand is called', or 'itis stated in the laws of dancing'.

**ANANDA COOMARASWAMY**

**THE INDIAN EDITOR'S PREFACE**

 THE BHARATA ŚĀSTRA, which is most dear to the Lord of Śrī,the Creator of every world, and which is the delight of everyconnoisseur in every world, has been brought into being by Śiva,Śambhu, Gauri, Brahmā, Mādhava, Nandikeśvara, Dattila,Kohala, Yājñavalkya, Nārada, Hanuman, Vighrarāja, Subrahmaṇiya, Arjuna, and the daughter of Bāṇa (i. e. Uṣā): theseare the famous authors of our science. Notwithstanding this, itis known to everyone that in these days our people not merelyneglect this lore as though it were of the common sort, but go sofar as to declare it to be an art that is only suited for the entertainment of the vulgar, unworthy of cultivated men, and fit tobe practised only by play-actors. But it is like the Union-science *(Yoga-śāstra*) which is the means of attaining spiritualfreedom (*mokṣa*): and the reason why a science such as this hascome to be regarded in such a fashion is that it is by movementsof the body (*angikābhinaya*) that the lineaments and interplayof hero and heroine, etc., are clearly exhibited, so as to directmen in the way of righteousness, and to reveal an esoteric meaning; obtaining the appreciation of connoisseurs and those whoare learned in the lore of gesture. But if we understand thisscience with finer insight, it will be evident that it has come intobeing to set forth the sport and pastime of Śrī Krishna, who isthe progenitor of every world, and the patron deity of the flavourof love; that by clearly expressing the flavour, and enablingmen to taste thereof, it gives them the wisdom of Brahma,whereby they may understand how every business is unstable;from which understanding arises indifference (*vairāgya*) to suchbusiness, and therefrom arise the highest virtues of peace andpatience, and thence again may be won the Bliss of Brahma.

 It has been declared by Brahmā and others that the mutualrelations of hero and heroine, in their esoteric meaning, partakeof the nature of the relations of master and pupil, mutual service

and mutual understanding; and therefore this Bharata Śāstra,which is a means to the achievement of the Four Aims of HumanLife,—Virtue, Wealth, Pleasure, and Spiritual Freedom,― andthe most exalted science, practised even by the Devas, shouldalso be patronized and practised by ourselves.

 So thinking, I resolved to restore the science to its formereminence, which has been day by day obscured. First of all waspublished the "Mirror of Gesture", composed by one of thefounders of the science, Nandikeśvara, to wit; but as it was notreadily understandable by all, there have been introduced intothis second edition pictures of the "Hands", with descriptions,and also particulars of the occasion of their origin, race, patrondeities, etc., mentioned in various works; and also combinedhands, hands to indicate famous emperors, sacred rivers, trees;animals, such as the lion; birds, such as the swan; watercreatures, such as the crocodile; and a classification of "Heads."In this way a total of four hundred and eight new verses havebeen introduced, and therewith a simple translation with easyTelugu words such as women and children can understand.

 Besides this we have published another book, the *BhārataRasa Prakaraṇa*, in which the Nine Flavours are explained,with Telugu translations; and there exists a reference work ofthe nature of a commentary, written by Rāja Mannāru GudiSabhāpataya Gāru, containing full explanations of such technical terms as *rāga, tāla, nāyaka, nāyakā, rasa*, etc. May those ofthe public who are connoisseurs both patronize and give us theirencouragement.

**THE MIRROR OF GESTURE  
DECLARED BY NANDIKEŚVARA**

 The movement of whose body is the world, whose speech the sum of alllanguage,  
 Whose jewels are the moon and stars—to that pure Śiva I bow!¹

***Indra***.—I bow to Nandikeśvara, who dwells on Kailāsa'smount, the ocean of the essence of compassion, who revealsthe meaning of the Laws of Dancing.

***Nandikeśvara***.—Welcome to the King of the Suras! Is it wellwith the dwellers in heaven? What is the cause that bringsyou here before me ?

***Indra***.—This devotee of thine, this dancer, head of the dancing-hall thy patronage adorns, has come to ask a favour.

***Nandikeśvara***.—Tell me truly and fully what I can do for you.

***Indra*.**—In the dancing-hall of the Daityas there is a dancer ofthe name of Naṭaśekhara. Indra seeks the Bharatārṇava,composed by thee, that he may gain the victory over him byauthentic knowledge of the skill of dancing.

***Nandikeśvara***.—Hear, then, with attention the Bharatārṇavalore complete in four thousand verses.

***Indra*.**—O Nandikeśvara, image of compassion, apart from thatimmensity, pray relate to me the authentic and entire Lawsof Dancing in a more concise form.

***Nandikeśvara***.—O wise of heart, O Deva, I reveal accordinglyan abridgment of the Bharatārṇava. Receive this simple"Mirror" attentively.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1 In this verse Śiva is compared to an actor, whose means of expression *(abhinaya)*are gesture, voice, and costume. He reveals himself through the world, the speechof men, and the starry firmament. The image of Siva as dancer (Naṭarāja, Naṭeśa)and actor is everywhere conspicuous in Śaiva literature (see "The Dance of Śiva",by A. K. Coomaraswamy," Siddhānta Dīpika ", Vol. XIII, i).

 The sages speak of Nāṭya, Nṛtta, and Nṛtya.**¹**Nāṭya isdancing used in a drama (*nāṭaka*) combined with the originalplot. Nṛtta is that form of dance which is void of flavour (*rasa*)and mood (*bhāva*). Nṛtya is that form of dance which possesses flavour, mood, and suggestion (*rasa, bhāva, vyañjanā*etc.), and the like. There is a twofold division of these three,Lāsya and Tāṇḍava. Lāsya dancing is very sweet, Tāṇḍavadancing is violent.

 Nāṭyaand Nṛtya should be seen especially at festivals. Nṛtyaat coronations, celebrations, processions of men or gods, marriages, reunion of friends, entry into towns or houses, the birthof children, and all auspicious occasions, by those who desirefortune. Brahmā has derived instrumental music, gesture, song,and flavour respectively from the Ṛg, Yajur, Sāma, and AtharvaVedas, and has made these Laws of Dancing which yield fulfilmentof the Four Ends of Life, and are means to overcome misfortune,hurt, affliction, disappointment, and regret, and yield therewithmore delight than even Brahma-bliss. Nṛtya should be seen bya royal audience in the courts of kings.

* The Audience* (*sabhā*).—The Audience shines like the Wishing-tree, when the Vedas are its branches, scriptures of art and science(*śāstras*) its flowers, and learned men the bees; where men oftruth are found, shining with good qualities, famous for righteousconduct, honoured by kings, adorned by the Vedas; where theVedānta is expounded; when distinguished by the sound ofvoice and lute (*vīṇā*); possessing heroes of renown, ornamentedby resplendent princes, shining with royal splendour.

 The Seven Limbs of the Audience are men of learning, poets,elders, singers, buffoons, and those who are familiar with historyand mythology.  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**  1** Nṛtta and Nṛtya constitute dancing as a separate art. The ordinary performance of a *nācnī*(nautch-girl, *bayadère*) consists of alternate Nṛtya and Nṛtta, theformer consisting of set dances with some special subject, and accompanied byvaried gesture, the latter merely moving to and fro, marking time with the feet, andso forth. Nṛtta is here dismissed with a merely negative definition, as the objectof the Abhinaya Darpaṇa is to explain how to express by gesture definite themes.

 According to Dhanaṃjaya ("Daśarūpa " I, 14) speaking of Nṛtya and Nṛtta,"the former, gesture-with-meaning is high (*mārga*), the latter popular (*deśi*).”

* **The Chief of the Audience*** **(sabhā-nāyaka)**.—He who is Chiefof the Audience should be wealthy, wise, discriminating, full ofgifts, versed in musical lore, omniscient, renowned, of charmingpresence, knowing the moods (*bhāvas*)**¹**and their expression(*hāva*), void of jealousy and like faults, familiar with customaryetiquette, sympathetic, a Dhīrodātta Nāyaka, expert in all thearts, clever in statecraft.

* ***The danseuse (*pātra***) should stand in the middle of the stage,and the dancer (*naṭa*) near her; on the right the cymbalist(*tāladhārī*); on either side the drummers (*mṛdangikaḥ*); thechorus (*gītakāraḥ*) between them; and the drone (*śrūtikāra*) alittle behind.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 **1** *Bhāva* is the first touch of emotion in a mind previously at rest; when theemotion becomes more intense, and finds expression in movements of the eyes, eyebrows, etc., it is called *hāva*. The ten *hāvas* or *sṛngāra-ceṣṭās* are included among thetwenty or twenty-eight ornaments (*alankāra*) of a heroine, as follows: *līlā*, theimitation of the lover; *vilāsa*, a flutter of delight, *vicchitti*, rearrangement of dressor jewels to enhance loveliness; *vibhrama*, confusion or flurry; kilakiñcita, a combination of anger, tears, joy, fear, etc.; moṭṭayita, absorption in thoughts of the loverwhen his name is heard; *kuṭṭamita*, feigned anger; *bibboka*, feigned indifference;*lalita*, graceful swaying or lolling; *vihṛta*, silence imposed by modesty.

 These are described in the "Sāhitya Darpaṇa" of Viśvanātha, “Dāśarūpa " ofDhanaṃjaya, "Bhāsa-bhuṣana" of Lāla-candrika, etc. The physical signs expressing the *hāvas* are detailed in subsequent verses of the "Mirror of Gesture,"(e.g. pp. 20, 25). Strictly speaking, *bhāva* is mood or feeling unexpressed, *hāva* isthe emotion which finds expression, *ceṣṭā*the gesture that expresses it. *Rasa* orflavour and vyañjanā or suggestion (transcending the literal meaning) distinguishpoetry from prose.

breasts, self-confident, charming, agreeable, dexterous in handling the critical passages,¹skilled in steps and rhythms, quite athome on the stage, expert in posing hands and body, gracefulin gesture, with wide-open eyes, able to follow song and instruments and rhythm, adorned with costly jewels, with a charminglotus-face, neither very stout nor very thin, nor very tall norvery short.

*** Disqualifications of a Danseuse***.—The Danseuse (*veśya*) shouldbe rejected, whose eyes are (pale) like a flower, whose hair isscanty, whose lips are thick, or breasts pendant, who is verystout or very thin, or very tall or very short, who is humpbacked, or has not a good voice.

* **The Bells (*kinkinī)**. The Bells should be made of bronze orcopper or silver; they should be sweet-toned, well-shaped,dainty, with the asterisms for their presiding deities, tied withan indigo string, with a knot between each pair of bells. At thetime of dancing there should be a hundred or two hundred foreach foot, or a hundred for the right foot and two hundred for theleft.**²**

* **The Dancer or Actor (*naṭa*)***.—Wise men say the Dancer (oractor) should be handsome, of sweet speech, learned, capable,eloquent, of good birth, learned in the scriptures (*śāstras*) ofart and science, of sweet voice, versed in song, instrumentalmusic, and dancing, self-confident, and of ready wit.

*** Outer Life (bahiḥ prāṇa) of the Danseuse***.—The following accessories are called the Outer Life of the Danseuse: the drum,cymbals of a good tone, the flute, the chorus, the drone, the lute(*vīṇā*), the bells, and a male singer (*gāyaka*) of renown.

 *I**nner Life (antaḥ prāṇa) of the Danseuse***.—The ten factorsof the Inner Life of the Danseuse are swiftness, composure,  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**  1** *Kuśala graha-mokṣayoh*, lit. expert in grasping and releasing, emphasizing andrelaxing the stress of emotion. The actress is not to be swayed by impulse, butperfectly self-possessed, mistress of a studied art, in accordance with the Telugusaying *bommale-vale ādintsuta*, "as if pulling the strings of a puppet", a phrasealso used in speaking of the relation of God to man and the universe.

**  2** No dancer ties the bells upon her ankles before dancing, without first touching her forehead and eyes with them, and repeating a brief prayer. Investiturewith the bells makes the adoption of a professional life inevitable.

symmetry, versatility, glances, ease, intelligence, confidence,speech, and song.

 ***Vulgar Dancing (nīca nāṭya)***.—Those who are versed in theScience of Dancing say that that dancing is vulgar in which theactress does not begin with prayer, etc.

*** The Fruit of Witnessing Vulgar Dances***.—Those who look uponthe dancing of such a vulgar actress will have no children, andwill be reborn in animal wombs.

 ***The Course of the Dance (*nāṭya-krama**).—What is said traditionally by our ancestors must therefore be kept in view.Having made the prayer, etc., the dancing may begin. The songshould be sustained in the throat; its meaning must be shownby the hands; the mood (*bhāva*) must be shown by the glances;rhythm (*tāla*) is marked by the feet. For wherever the handmoves, there the glances follow; where the glances go, the mindfollows; where the mind goes, the mood follows; where themood goes, there is the flavour (*rasa*).

**GESTURE** **(*abhinaya*)**

    Gesture is the principal theme of what is here related.

  The root ni with the prefix *abhi* implies exposition, and theword *abhinaya* is used in this sense. According to another book(*granthāntare*), *abhinaya* is so called because it evokes flavour(*rasa*) in the audience. There are three kinds of gesture:**¹**bodily,vocal, and ornamental (*āngika, vācika, āhārya*), besides the pure,passionate, and dark (*sāttvika*, etc.). Here we are only concerned with *angikābhinaya*, “Exposition by means of the gestures of the body and limbs."

 The three elements of bodily gesture are the limbs, parts ofthe body, and features (*anga, pratyanga, upānga*).

 In *Angābhinaya* the head, hands, arm-pits, sides, waist, andfeet, these six, and some say also the neck, are called the limbs.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**1** Observe that *abhinaya* strictly speaking meansexpression" whether bygesture, singing, or costume. In the present work it is expression by gesture whichis considered, and on this account the term abhinaya has been rendered by "gesture "throughout.

 In *Pratyangābhinaya* the shoulders, shoulder-blades, arms,back, stomach, thighs and calves, some say also three others,the wrists, knees, and elbows, are the parts of the body.

 In *Upāngābhinaya* the eyes, eyelids, pupils, cheeks, nose, jaw,the lips, teeth, tongue, chin, face, these eleven are the features.Beside these are the accessories, such as the heel, ankle, fingersand toes, and palms, which I mention according to the old books.

 Only such as are useful in dancing will be described. Theclassification of Heads will be given first, then that of the Glances,Neck, Hands, and Actions, and from these five will appear theresulting movements.
