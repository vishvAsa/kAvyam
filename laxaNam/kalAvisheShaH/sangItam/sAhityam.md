## विभागः
### पदः
- a specific type of composition with a pallavi, an anupallavi and several charanas. The pallavi line is repeated after the anupallavi and each of the charanas.

#### History
> The earliest Haridāsa from Karnataka is Narahari tīrtha from the 14th century and there are two padas attributed to him. So it is very likely the type of composition pada originated in Kannada too. Later on, during the 15th century, more padas were composed both in Kannada and Telugu by Śrīpādarāya and Annamayya respectively who were contemporaries. After Śrīpādarāya, we have a tradition of hundreds of Haridāsas beginning with Vyāsarāya, Purandara dāsa and Kanaka dāsa composing thousands of padas in Kannada. These padas vary in their content and have themes based on Śṛṅgāra, Adhyatma and Bhakti (love, philosophy and devotion are but a poor translation of these terms). By the 18th century, the term pada got itself restricted to refer to only those with Śṛṅgāra as the main theme. This may be due to the 17th century composer Kṣētrayya who composed only Śṛṅgāra padas that became very popular after his time.

### सुळादिः
- These are compositions set in a single raga and multiple talas, and generally have a pallavi, several charanas (usually 5 or 7) and end with 2 lines called jote.
- The meaning of the word suḷādi is not completely understood – there are conflicting views about the names among scholars. While some suggest that it comes from the Kannada phrase “suḷuhu hādi”, or “sūḷ hādi” (“a good path”) , others consider that it derives from another type of musical composition called sAlaga sUDa prabandha from earlier times.

### उगाभोगः
- etymology is not settled

## स्वासाय विरामः
- तत्र स्याद् यत्र रसभङ्गो न स्याद् अपार्थज्ञापनेन। तेन लम्बसमासात् प्राग् एव श्वासः। पदान्ते एव श्वासस्वीकृतिस्थानम् उत्तमम्।
