## Emotions
### Basic vs self-conscious
- basic 
  - sadness, fear, anger, etc.
  - have a well-documented neurobiological basis, emerge early in life, perform a survival-related function, are associated with a universally recognizable facial expression, and recruit fewer cognitive processes
- self-conscious
  - (the commonly studied of which are shame, guilt, pride, jealousy, and envy) 
  - that have a less clear-cut neurobiological basis, emerge later in life, perform a social function, are not associated with a universally recognizable facial expression, and require complex cognitive mechanisms.

## 49 vṛtti-s
- 49 modes (vṛtti-s) in which the mind (citta) can exist. Aka bhāva-s.
- not all mental states are capable of being communicated to the same degree.

### sthāyibhāva
- 8 or 9 enduring mental states (sthāyibhāva-s).
  -  रति, हास, शोक, क्रोध, उत्साह, भय, जुगुप्सा, विस्मय (desire, mirth, sorrow, heroism, anger, fear, aversion, and astonishment).
- Examples of enduring mental states include love, anger, fear, and sorrow. 
- Communicated using accessory mental states.
- Communication to a sahRdaya transforms it into its aesthetic counterpart - its ‘rasa’ in him. 
  - शृङ्गार-वीर-बीभत्स-रौद्र-हास्य-भयानकाः । करुणाद्भुत-शान्ताश् च नव नाट्या रसाः स्मृताः ॥

### vyabhicāri-bhāva
- 41 accessory transient (vyabhicāri-bhāva-s)
- 33 purely mental states. Eg. pride, jealousy, recollection, shame, and apprehension.
- 8 psychophysical states (sāttvika-bhāva-s). 
  - Eg. tear flow, perspiration, palpitation, and goose bumps. 
  - Understood as having an internal (psychophysiological) and an external (physical) aspect to them. The सात्त्विकभावs have a dual nature, of अनुभाव (tear flow) and  व्यभिचारिभाव.

## Communication of bhāva-s
- Highly efficient communication of an enduring mental state (to a person maintaining aesthetic distance) transforms it into its aesthetic counterpart - its ‘rasa’.
  - भरत-रस-सूत्रम् - विभावानुभाव-व्यभिचारि-संयोगाद् रसनिष्पत्तिः। 
- Can infer real-life mental states (sthāyibhāva-s) by accessing information about their antecedent stimuli (kāraṇa-s) (+ transient sahakāri-kāraṇas) and consequent responses (kārya-s). Inferred mental state is strongly tied to the character. Can trouble the viewer (if not detached).
- Mental states (sthāyibhāva-s) of literary charactersare inferred from vibhāva (+ vyabhicāri-bhāva) and anubhāva. vibhāva, anubhāva and bhāva-s here are impersonal, generalized versions of their real world counterparts. Produce aesthetic delight (rasa) in the viewer.
  - People like abhinavagupta claim that the inference here is different from the real-world counterpart, and call it ‘dhvani’ aka 'implicature'.
  - People like shankuka say that the inference part here is exactly the same whether on stage or in real-world.

lollaTa says that characters (eg. rAma) already has the sthāyibhāva (eg. sadness) before the vibhāva-s, vyabhicāribhāvas and anubhāvas "enrich" it. दण्डी काव्यादर्शे - "रतिः शृङ्गारतां गता रूपबाहुल्ययोगेन"।
