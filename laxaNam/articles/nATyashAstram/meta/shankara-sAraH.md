- Bharata knows that aesthetic experience differs from mundane experience but does not dwell on it, as concerns are practical. 
- Providing a list of states (mental, subjective, experiential) communicated by actors 
- Classifying them into 2 groups - enduring and transient 
- Explicating the hierarchical relation between them → Discussing how they can be communicated by actors to the audience (given they are subjective and therefore cannot be experienced first hand)

Concerns of other aestheticians (... Bhatta Nayaka, Abhinavagupta, Bhoja, Rupa Goswamin)

- Nature of aesthetic experience 
- How worldly objects and everyday subjects are transformed during aesthetic experience
