## ಪರಿಚಯ
(ಸದಾಸ್ವಾತಪತ್ರಿಕಾಯಾಮ್ ಮೋಹನಃ।)

The meter is a simple doubled-up caupadi with repeated 3-mātrā elements (‘lā-la’ or ‘la-la-la’):

3-3-3-3  
3-3-3-3  
3-3-3-3
3-4 Twice

Also of note is the gentleness of the flow — no harsh or even dissimilar half consonants, short words and a middle-Kannada style that is very close to the modern spoken tongue, but just distant enough to mark it out as special. 

The temple being referred to is the Yoga Narasimha Swamy temple atop the hill in Melkote. 

Rangavalli appears in his collection Haṇate, and is among his finest Bhakti poems.
