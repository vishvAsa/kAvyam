Veṇugopāla plays on his flute and creates delightful music and casts his most merciful glances on the Gopīs. They are totally captivated by his friendly smile and the divine music originating from His flute. At this time, His cool and welcoming eyes resemble a pair of just-blossomed lotuses in the river of His mercy (Dayā). May this enchanting youth Gopāla protect me always!

May the resplendent blue jyoti of Gopāla reminding one of an incomparable blue gem stone (indranīla or blue sapphire), with blue peacock feather decorations on His dark black hair and the divine flute on His lips appear before me during the last moments of my life on this earth.  

This is the famous verse sung by Sage Nārada in Sankalpa Suryodayam. The beauty of Veṇugopāla (The Flute player Gopāla) and His world-enchanting flute music has been celebrated by Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam and Periyazhwaar in particular (Periya Tirumozhi: 3.6)  

## 13

Even in His incarnation as Kṛṣṇa/Gopāla, Śrī Devi is always united with Him. He has left her His chest region as Her place of special residence and enjoyment. He has the eternal and youthful beauty that qualifies Him to play with Her. We are powerless to describe His full beauty. The Gopīs of Gokulam are thirsting to enjoy His beauty. I am blessed to have the vision of this beautiful youth everywhere and at all times.  

## 14

Which (bold) artist has drawn this picture of this insatiable beauty known as Gopāla in my heart? Who etched this embodiment of beauty wearing the charming peacock feathers in His hair? Which painter painted the picture of this beautiful youth in my heart, who is like the morning Sun to the lotus-like faces of the love-sick Gopīs ?  

## 15  

महसे महिताय मौलिना

mahase mahitāya maulinā

I join my hands in Anjali Mudra and lower my head in salutation of that much revered effulgent, dark-hued Jyothi of Gopāla, whose divine flute music joins in conversation as it were with the tāḷam of Gopīs whose golden bangles that jingle as they keep up with the rhythmic patterns.  

## 16  

जयति ललित वृत्तिं शिक्षितो वल्लवीनां  
शितिल वलय शिञ्जा शीतलैर्हस्त तालैः ।  
अखिल भुवन रक्षा गोप वेषस्य विष्णोः  
अधर मणि सुधायां अम्शवान्‌ वंशनालः ॥ १६ ॥  

jayati lalita vṛttiṁ śikṣito vallavīnāṁ  
śitila valaya śiñjā śītalairhasta tālaiḥ |

adhara maṇi sudhāyāṁ amśavān vaṁśanālaḥ || 16 ||  

The incarnation of Vishnu taking the form of a cowherd to protect all the universes has on its coral-red lips the bamboo flute that tastes the nectar of this Gopala's mouth. As he plays the flute on the banks of the Yamuna river during the moon-lit nights, the lovelorn Gopīs engage in rAsa krīḍa with him. The Gopīs beat tāḷam to the music of their Lord with their cool hands decorated with golden bangles. Their follow-up with taaLam suggests as though they are teaching the abhinayam step known as Laḷitham to the flute of the Lord. [The Abhinaya sastras describe Laḷitham as the gesture, where the dancer places her hands on the appropriate portion of the body and change the movement of her eyebrows to mimic the different rasas. The delectable interplay between the bhāvam, rāgam and tāḷam - Bharatanatyam - is suggested here as the rāsa krīḍa progresses.]

चित्राकल्पः श्रवसि कलयन्‌ लाङ्गली कर्णपूरं  
बर्होत्तंस स्फुरित चिकुरो बन्धुजीवं दधानः ।  
गुञ्जा बद्धा मुरसि ललितां धारयन्‌ हार यष्टिं

gopa strīṇāṁ jayati kitavaḥ ko'pi kaumāra hārī || 17 ||  
Gopāla is a roamer of the forest. Hence, he decorates himself with the ornaments appropriate to the dwellers of the forests i.e. natural products available in the forests.  

The mischievous Gopāla, who stole the youth of the Gopīs appears before them with many decorations that enhance his beauty. On his ears, the Gopīs find the flower known as Lāngali (flower from the coconut tree's sheaf/ Tennampālai flower); peacock feathers are found by them on his dark and curly tresses; red hibiscus also decorates those tresses. On his broad chest, they find a beautiful necklace made of yellowish-red seeds known as Gunjā or Kunrimani strung together . With these and more ābharaṇās made of forest products, Gopāla enchants the hearts of the adoring Gopīs  
## 18  

लीलायष्टिं कर किसलये दक्षिणे न्यस्य धन्याम्‌  
अंसे देव्याः पुलक रुचिरे सन्निविष्टान्य बाहुः ।  
मेघ श्यामो जयति ललितो मेखला दत्त वेणुः  
कुञ्जापीड स्फुरित चिकुरो गोपकन्या भुजङ्गः ॥ १८ ॥  

līlāyāṣṭiṁ kara kisalaye dakṣiṇe nyasya dhanyām  
aṁse devyāḥ pulaka rucire sanniviṣṭānya bāhuḥ |  
megha śyāmo jayati lalito mekhalā datta veṇuḥ  
kuñjāpīḍa sphurita cikuro gopakanyā bhujaṅgaḥ || 18 ||  

Lord Gopāla, showing great affection for the Gopīs, stands before them in resplendent attire. He strikes a pose with his tender right hand holding the shepherd's bent stick; his left hand rests on the shoulder of the beautiful Nappinnai; that touch of Gopāla sends shivers of joy over Nappinnai's body. That beautiful Gopāla has tucked his flute inside his waist band and has additional decoration in the form of a chain of Kunrimani beads tied across his own dark hair pulled up in the form of a bun. He shines with his dark blue hue, reminiscent of the clouds in the rainy season and wins over the Gopīs with his formidable beauty. He roams around with great desire for union with Gopīs.  

## 19  

प्रत्यालीढ स्थितिमधिगतां प्राप्त गाढाङ्ग पालिं  
पश्चा दीषन्मिलित नयनां प्रेयसीं प्रेक्षमाणः ।  
भस्रा यन्त्र प्रणिहित करो भक्त जीवातु रव्यात्‌  
वारि क्रीडा निबिड वसनो वल्लवी वल्लभो नः ॥ १९ ॥  

pratyālīḍha sthitimadhigatāṁ prāpta gāḍhāṅga pāliṁ  
paścā dīṣanmilita nayanāṁ preyasīṁ prekṣamāṇaḥ |  
bhasrā yantra praṇihita karo bhakta jīvātu ravyāt  
vāri krīḍā nibiḍa vasano vallavī vallabho naḥ || 19 ||  
Gopāla desirous of performing water sports with the Gopīs tucked tightly his garments. He took in his hands the water pump used in those sports. He approached one of the Gopīs, who was standing with one foot forward in the water and the other planted backward on the land. He surprised her from behind and embraced her tightly. That Gopī was overpowered by that delectable experience and partially closed her eyes and looked at Gopāla with half-open eyes. He returned her affectionate glances. Their eyes met.  

May that Gopāla engaged in water sports with the Gopīs as their lover protect us, since he is the medicine for his devotees suffering from the afflictions of Samsāra.

वासो हृत्वा दिनकर सुतासन्निधौ वल्लवीनां  
लीलास्मेरो जयति ललिताम्‌ आस्थितः कुन्द शाखाम्‌ ।  
सव्रीडाभिस्तदनु वसने ताभिरभ्यर्थ्य माने  
कामि कश्चित्‌ कर कमलयोर्‌ अञ्जलिं याचमानः ॥ २० ॥

kāmi kaścit kara kamalayor añjaliṁ yācamānaḥ || 20 ||  
On the banks of the Yamunā river shines the Lord, who is seated on the bow of a kunthā tree with a smile on his face. He is enjoying the prank that he played on the unsuspecting Gopīs, who had left their clothes on the river bank and were engaged in taking morning ablutions. [He wanted to teach them a lesson for breaking the rules of Sāstras, which forbid one from taking bath in the river without wearing a cloth.] Gopāla sneaked up on the crowd of Gopīs deeply absorbed in water sports and took all of their clothes and climbed up the kunthā tree and sat on one of its branch and waited for them to come out of the water. The unaware Gopīs completed their water sports and ablutions and got out of the water and discovered that their clothes were removed by the smiling Gopāla sitting on the adjacent Pinnai (Kuntha) tree. Overcome by modesty, they rushed back into the water and prayed to him to return their clothes. He commanded them to come out of the water with folded hands raised above their hands [as a mark of atonement for the sin of breaking the injunctions of Sāstras]. They had no choice, but to obey him to regain their clothes. May that mischievous Gopāla fond of Gopīs be victorious!

इत्यनन्य मनसा विनिर्मितां वेङ्कटेश कविना स्तुतिं पठन्‌

ityananya manasā vinirmitāṁ veṅkaṭeśa kavinā stutiṁ paṭhan  
divya veṇu rasikaṁ samīkṣate daivataṁ kimapi yauvata priyam || 21 ||  

This stotram has been created by the poet Veṅkaṭeśa, who does not consider any God other than Gopāla/ Nārāyaṇa. Those who read and recite this eulogy will have the blessings of the darśanam of the God of incomparable beauty, Veṇugopāla (The Flute player Gopāla) who was the keen object of desire of youthful gopīs.
