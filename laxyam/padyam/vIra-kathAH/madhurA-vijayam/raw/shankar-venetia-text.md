**मधुराविजयम्**

**The Conquest Of Madhurā**

## १
**प्रथमः सर्गः**

**FIRST CANTO**





महाकविमुखाम्भोजमणिपञ्जरशारिकाम् ।  
चैतन्यजलधिज्योत्स्नां देवीं वन्दे सरस्वतीम् ॥ १ ॥ अनुष्टुभ् 

    

To the goddess of speech,  
Sarasvatī,  
do I bow –  
a *śārikā* in the bejewelled birdcages  
of the best bards’ lotus mouths,  
the moonlight  
rousing the ocean of human consciousness. 1 



निर्दोषाप्यगुणा वाणी न विद्वज्जनरञ्जिनी ।  
पतिव्रताप्यरूपा स्त्री परिणेत्रे न रोचते ॥ २ ॥ 

A poem may be sound,  
but unless sweet  
it will not delight the literati.  
A wife may be faithful,  
but unless pretty  
she will not please her spouse. 2 



न प्रार्थनीयः सत्काव्यश्रुत्यै सहृदयो जनः ।  
स्वादुपुष्परसास्वादे कः प्रेरयति षट्पदम् ॥ ३ ॥ 

A man of taste needs no encouragement  
to listen to good poetry.  
Who urges the bee  
to sip the sweet nectar seeping from blown buds? 3 



तन्मदीयमिदं काव्यं विबुधाः श्रोतुमर्हथ ।  
मधुराविजयं नाम चरितं कम्पभूपतेः ॥ ४ ॥ 

Learned listeners\!  
Give ear  
to this poem here,  
*Madhurā Vijaya – The Conquest of Madhurā,*  
the story of King Kampa. 4 



आसीत् समस्तसामन्तमस्तकन्यस्तशासनः ।  
बुक्कराज इति ख्यातो राजा हरिहरानुजः ॥ ५ ॥ 

There lived a king  
named Bukkarāja,  
the younger brother of Harihara.  
Brave kings from each border  
with heads bent consented to his every order. 5 



विवेकमेव सचिवं धनुरेव वरूथिनीम् ।  
बाहुमेव रणोत्साहे यः सहायममन्यत ॥ ६ ॥ 

When waging war,  
he needed no counsel but his own judgement,  
no troops but his own bow  
no allies but his two arms. 6 



विरोधिवाहिनीनाथविक्षोभणपटीयसा ।  
भुजेन भूभृता यस्य प्राप्ता कीर्तिमयी सुधा ॥ ७ ॥ 

    

Roiling the whole host of hostile kings,  
vast as the ocean,  
with the mountain of his globe-bearing arm –  
child’s play for him –  
he produced his own *amṛta*, fame. 1 7 



परिपन्थिनृपप्राणपवनाहारदारुणः ।  
असृजद्भुजगो यस्य कृपाणः कीर्तिकञ्चुकम् ॥ ८ ॥ 

The sword he wielded was a snake,  
violently devouring the very air his adversaries breathed,  
and slewing off the celebrity he secured  
as its now whitened skin. 8 



कलिकालमहाघर्मप्लुष्टो धर्ममहीरुहः ।  
यस्य दानाम्बुसेकेन पुनरङ्कुरितोऽभवत् ॥ ९ ॥ 

The tree of *dharma*,  
seared clear of moisture  
by the horrendous heat of the accursed Kali Yuga,  
sprouted afresh with the water he poured  
while handing out gifts 2. 9 



यस्याङ्घ्रिपीठसङ्घर्षरेखालाञ्छितमौलयः ।  
आशास्वरिनृपा एव जयस्तम्भतया स्थिताः ॥ १० ॥ 

The very kings who had opposed him  
became his victory pillars  
spread in every direction,  
their heads scarred with lines  
scored from prostrating at his footstool. 3 10 



बद्धाः सभाङ्गणे यस्य भान्ति स्म जयसिन्धुराः ।  
बन्दीकृता इवाम्भोदा जैत्रयात्रानिरोधिनः ॥ ११ ॥ 

War elephants  
stood shackled in the palace courtyard  
as though they were hulking rainclouds  
thrown into chains  
for daring to halt his military assaults. 11 



तस्यासीद्विजया नाम विजयार्जितसम्पदः ।  
राजधानी बुधैः श्लाघ्या शक्रस्येवामरावती ॥ १२ ॥ 

As Indra has Amarāvatī glorified by the gods,  
the King –  
grown rich on triumph –  
had for his capital a city celebrated by poets,  
known to all as Vijayā – ‘Triumph’. 12 



सुरलोकान्तसंक्रान्तस्वर्णदीमत्सरादिव ।  
परिखाकारतां यान्त्या परीता तुङ्गभद्र‌‍या ॥ १३ ॥ 

The Tuṅgabhadrā circled the city,  
serving as a moat,  
as if to rival the Gaṅgā  
who gushes around the bounds of the gods’ domain. 13 



लक्ष्मीलतालवालेन क्ष्मावधूनाभिशोभिना ।  
चक्राचलप्रकारेण प्राकारेण परिष्कृता ॥ १४ ॥ 

A smart rampart wreathed the royal city of Vijayā,  
as though it was  
the pool in which her flowering fortune-creeper flourished,  
the lovely navel of Lady Earth  
or a circle of soaring mountains. 14 



यशःस्तोमैरिवाशेषनगरीविजयार्जितैः ।  
सौधैः प्रकाशितोत्सेधा शरदम्भोदपाण्डरैः ॥ १५ ॥ 

Mansions white as clouds in Śarad –  
drifts of fame  
amassed by outshining all other cities –  
spoke of her stature. 15 



यत्सौधचन्द्रशालासु विहरन्त्यो मृगेक्षणाः ।  
शशाङ्कमवलम्बन्ते मुक्ताकन्दुकशङ्क‍या ॥ १६ ॥ 

The doe-eyed ladies  
playing in the sky-high attics  
of the city’s palaces  
would try to catch the full moon,  
foolishly mistaking it for their pearl-embroidered ball. 16 



पद्मरागोपलोत्कीर्णप्रासादप्रान्तवर्तिनः ।  
सन्ततं यत्र दृश्यन्ते सान्ध्या इव बलाहकाः ॥ १७ ॥ 

    

Clouds  
roaming around her ruby-reddened rooftops  
seemed to be permanently stained  
by the setting sun. 17 



सन्ध्यासु यत्र निर्यान्ति जालेभ्यो धूपराजयः ।  
अन्तःप्रदीपिकालोकचकितध्वान्तसन्निभाः ॥ १८ ॥ 

Every evening,  
trails of incense smoke would race  
out of the city’s windows,  
as though they were gangs of darkness  
frightened into flight at the sight  
of the oil lamps standing guard within. 18 



देवायी नाम तस्यासीद्देवी वसुमतीपतेः ।  
पद्मा पद्मेक्षणस्येव शङ्करस्येव पार्वती ॥ १९ ॥ 

The chief queen of this emperor of the earth,  
known as Devāyī,  
was to him  
as the lotus-abiding Lakṣmī to the lotus-eyed Viṣṇu,  
as to Śiva Pārvatī. 19 



कर्णाटलोकनयनोत्सवपूर्णचन्द्रः  
साकं तया हृदयसम्मतया नरेन्द्रः ।  
कालोचितान्यनुभवन् क्रमशः सुखानि  
वीरश्चिराय विजयापुरमध्यवात्सीत् ॥ २० ॥ वसन्ततिलका 

This brave king,  
the brightening full moon  
upon which his Karṇāṭa people gazed in delight,  
dwelled in Vijayā for many a year,  
enjoying in turn the pleasures suited to each stage of life,  
with her  
his soul-mate. 20 


The King’s arm is here compared to Mount Mandara which was used to churn the ocean to produce *amṛta*.

Water was ritually sprinkled upon the hands of those receiving gifts.

Victory pillars were erected by kings to mark the boundaries of their new-won domains and would be engraved with a declaration of their rule.

**द्वितीयः सर्गः**

**SECOND CANTO**





अथास्य वंशप्रतिरोहबीजं  
महीभुजो गर्भमधत्त देवी ।  
जगत्त्रयोद्भूतिनिदानभूतं  
तेजो विधातुः प्रथमेव सृष्टिः ॥ १ ॥ उपजातिः 

In time the King sired upon the Queen  
the seed which would perpetuate the dynasty –  
just as the creator sires upon primaeval matter  
the energy which brings into being the three worlds. 1 



मुखेन तन्वी शरपाण्डरेण  
विमुक्तरत्नाभरणा विरेजे ।  
विलूनराजीववना दिनान्ते  
छायाशशाङ्केन शरन्नदीव ॥ २ ॥ 

Slender,  
no more oppressed by ornaments,  
her round face reed-pale,  
the Queen resembled a river run to a trickle in Śarad,  
no longer blanketed in day-blossoming lotus blooms,  
harbouring the orbed moon  
as night draws near. 2 



अनन्यसामान्यभुजापदान-  
मुत्पत्स्यमानं तनयं नृपस्य ।  
अनारतं वीररसानुबन्धं  
न्यवेदयद्दौहृदमेव देव्याः ॥ ३ ॥ 

The pregnant queen’s cravings  
ever veered towards the heroic,  
suggesting that the royal heir she would soon bear  
would author deeds assayed by no other. 3 



अपारयन्ती चरितैणशाबं  
क्रीडाचलोपान्तमपि प्रयातुम् ।  
आखेटरागादधिरोढुमैच्छ-  
न्माद्यन्मृगेन्द्रान् मलयाद्रिकूटान् ॥ ४ ॥ 

So spent was her strength  
she couldn’t even reach  
the foot of the ornamental hill  
where fawns scampered,  
yet in her thirst for a kill  
she dreamed of climbing the mighty Malaya mountain  
to hunt maddened lions. 4 



पृथ्वी रथः सारथिरब्जसूतिः  
शेषेण सज्यं धनुरद्रिराजः ।  
शरश्च शौरिः किल हन्त लक्ष्यं  
त्रयं पुरामित्यहसत् पुरारिम् ॥ ५ ॥ 

‘The earth for a chariot;  
Brahmā himself the charioteer.  
The king of snakes serving as bowstring,  
and Mount Meru his bow.  
And, so they say,  
no less than Śauri1 as his shaft.  
To fight whom?  
A mere triad of cities\!’  
Thus did she scorn Śiva,  
conqueror of the three cities.2 5 



सौभाग्यगन्धद्विपदानलेखा  
रराज तस्या नवरोमराजिः ।  
तेजोनिधिं गर्भतले निषण्णं  
कालोरगी रक्षितुमागतेव ॥ ६ ॥ 

A fresh line of fine hair flashed below her navel –  
glistening like a streak of ichor from  
the mighty elephant of her waxing fortune –  
as though it were a cobra  
come to guard the luminous treasure  
buried deep within her womb.3 6 



अथ प्रशस्ते दिवसे समस्तै-  
र्मौहूर्तिकैः साधितपुण्यलग्ने ।  
असूत सूनुं नरनाथपत्नी  
देवी महासेनमिवेन्दुमौलेः ॥ ७ ॥ 

Then on the happy day –  
declared by astrologers near and far  
to be blessed with an auspicious star –  
the earthly lord’s lady  
bore a son who would lead a mighty army;  
just as Pārvatī,  
consort to the moon-crested Śiva,  
bore Kumāra, leader of heaven’s army. 7 



महौजसस्तस्य निजैर्यशोभि-  
रुद्वेलदुग्धोदधिपूरगौरैः ।  
प्रक्षालितानीव तदा बभूवु-  
र्धृतप्रसादानि दिशां मुखानि ॥ ८ ॥ 

At that moment,  
the faces of the directions grew clear  
as if washed clean by the gleaming child’s glory,  
white as the flood of the milky sea spilling its shores. 8 



आगामिनीमध्वरहव्यसिद्धिं  
निश्चित्य देशेष्वपि दक्षिणेषु ।  
प्रदक्षिणीभूतशिखाकलापो  
ननर्त हर्षादिव हव्यवाहः ॥ ९ ॥ 

Realising that sacrificial oblations  
would soon be offered in the South too,  
the fire danced a jig of joy,  
weaving his mass of flames into worshipful arcs –  
or so it seemed. 9 



सुखायमानां सुतजन्मवार्तां  
सहर्षमावेदयते जनाय ।  
अवाञ्छदात्मानमपि प्रदातुं  
कुतूहली कुन्तलभूमिपालः ॥ १० ॥ 

In his euphoria,  
the Kuntala king  
was ready to give his very self  
to the exultant servants  
bringing the sweet news  
of his son’s birth. 10 



विशृङ्खलास्तस्य गिरा निरीयुः  
कारागृहेभ्यो विमतावरोधाः ।  
तुलुष्कबन्दीनिवहाय तूर्ण-  
मागामिने दातुमिवावाकाशम् ॥ ११ ॥ 

Upon the Emperor’s orders,  
the womenfolk of the vanquished  
were unshackled and released from their prison cells,  
as if to make room  
for the trillion Tuluṣka wives and daughters,  
soon to arrive. 11 



स्नातस्ततो धौतदुकूलधारी  
वितीर्य भूरि द्रविणं द्विजेभ्यः ।  
महीपतिः पुत्रमुखं दिदृक्षुः  
प्राविक्षदन्तःपुरमात्तहर्षः ॥ १२ ॥ 

Then the King,  
after bathing and dressing in sparkling new silks,  
bestowed lavish gifts upon Brahmins.  
Longing to look upon his new-born son,  
he came to his queens’ quarters  
aquiver with joy. 12 



अवैक्षत क्षामशरीरयष्टेः  
कुमारमुत्सङ्गगतं स देव्याः ।  
शरत्कृशाया इव शैवलिन्या-  
स्तरङ्गलग्नं कलहंसशाबम् ॥ १३ ॥ 

He beheld his son  
rocking in the lap of the Queen,  
her thin frame grown frail,  
like a young *haṃsa*  
bobbing upon the billow of a river  
slimmed by Śarad. 13 



मुहुर्मुहुः पल्लवपाटलेन  
मुष्टीकृतेन द्वितयेन पाण्योः ।  
अरातिलक्ष्मीकचसञ्चयाना-  
माकर्षशिक्षामिव शीलयन्तम् ॥ १४ ॥ 

As the child formed fists again and again  
with hands pale pink like fresh shoots,  
it seemed he was practising  
how to wrest from his rivals  
the tutelary goddess of each,  
dragging them by their tightly tied braids. 14 



अव्याजसौन्दर्यगुणाभिरामं  
कुमारमालोकयतश्चिराय ।  
नृपस्य निष्पन्ददृशो मुहूर्त-  
मानन्दबाष्पोऽभवदन्तरायः ॥ १५ ॥ 

A tear of joy for a moment obscured  
the Lord’s long and unblinking gaze  
as he stared at the child he had sired,  
enthralled by his unadorned beauty. 15 



आश्लिष्यतस्तस्य दृशा तनूज-  
मन्तः प्रहर्षेण विजृम्भितेन ।  
प्रायः प्रणुन्नैर्बहिरङ्गकेभ्यः  
प्रादुर्बभूवे पुलकप्ररोहैः ॥ १६ ॥ 

    

As the King drank in his son with his eyes,  
the happiness within him swelled to bursting  
and appeared to push out the very hair  
on each part of his body  
so that he prickled with goosebumps. 16 



आकम्पयिष्यत्ययमेकवीरः  
संग्रामरङ्गे सकलानरातीन् ।  
इत्येव निश्चित्य स दीर्घदर्शी  
नाम्ना सुतं कम्पन इत्यकार्षीत् ॥ १७ ॥ 

With great prescience  
the King knew that the boy would become  
a warrior matched by none,  
terrorising every one of his enemies  
in the hurly-burly of battle,  
and thus named him Kampana,  
The Terrifying. 17 



क्रमेण धात्रीजनशिक्षितानि  
वचांसि यातानि च मन्थराणि ।  
स्खलत्पदान्यस्य धराधिनाथो  
निशम्य दृष्ट्वा च स निर्वृतोऽभूत् ॥ १८ ॥ 

In due course,  
the sight and sound of his son,  
guided by the nurses,  
tottering and tripping over  
his first faltering syllables and steps,  
brought the emperor of the earth true bliss. 18 



कलक्वणत्काञ्चनकिङ्किणीकं  
गृहाङ्गणे जानुचरं कुमारम् ।  
आलोकयन्तावमृताम्बुराशे-  
र्मग्नाविवान्तः पितरावभूताम् ॥ १९ ॥ 

    

Watching their son  
crawling on all fours in the courtyard,  
his baby golden bells babbling blithely,  
his parents felt as if  
they had dived into a deep ocean of *amṛta*. 19 



पशुपतिरिव नेत्रैः सोमसूर्याग्निरूपै-  
र्नय इव निरपायैः प्राभवोत्साहमन्त्रैः ।  
भव इव पुरुषार्थैर्धर्मकामार्थसंज्ञै-  
स्त्रिभिरपि नरपालस्तैस्तनूजैरभासीत् ॥ २० ॥ मालिनी 

As Śiva with his triad of eyes –  
the moon, the sun and fire;  
as sovereignty with its inseparable triple supports –  
dominion, determination and counsel;  
as this worldly life with its threefold goals  
*dharma, kāma* and *artha* –  
so the King shone with his three sons4. 20 


Viṣṇu

Śiva had all this and more when he went to fight the *asuras’* Tripura.

Snakes are often thought of as guardians of treasure.

The poetess earlier described, in a verse not included here, how Bukkarāja had two more sons by Devāyī.

**तृतीयः सर्गः**

**THIRD CANTO**





ततो यथावत्कृतचौलसंस्क्रियो  
नरेन्द्रसूनुः स्वत एव लब्धवान् ।  
कलासु शश्वत् सकलासु कौशलं  
गुरूपदेशस्त्वपदेशतामगात् ॥ १ ॥ वंशस्थम् 

In due course,  
once he had undergone  
the *caula* ceremony  
as he ought,  
His Majesty Kampa fast mastered all major disciplines –  
schooled by a *guru*,  
though he had no need for schooling. 1 



स पञ्चबाणद्विपकेलिदीर्घिकां  
धरानुरागद्रुमपुष्पमञ्जरीम् ।  
नितम्बिनीनेत्रचकोरचन्द्रिका-  
मवापदास्कन्दितशैशवां दशाम् ॥ २ ॥ 

Youth suddenly succeeded childhood.  
And his youth was  
the lake where Kāma, as elephant, wallows;  
the blossom upon the tree  
that was the nation’s adoration;  
the moonlight cherished by the *cakora*-like eyes  
of heavy-hipped ladies. 2 



स रूपगर्वेण निरास्थदङ्घ्रिणा  
स्मरस्य नूनं जयवैजयन्तिकाम् ।  
न चेत् कथं तस्य तलेऽतिकोमले  
सुलेखमालक्ष्यत मीनलाञ्छनम् ॥ ३ ॥ 

Glorying in his beauty,  
he must have trampled  
upon Kāma’s triumphal banner.  
Why else did the perfectly formed lines  
upon his soles so soft  
assume the shape of a fish?1 3 



अधारयद्दर्शितदेहसौष्ठवां  
स राजसूनुस्तनुवृत्तमध्यताम् ।  
पराक्रमत्रासितचित्तवृत्तिभि-  
र्मृगाधिराजैरुपदीकृतामिव ॥ ४ ॥ 

The slender circumference of his waist –  
setting off his stately physique –  
seemed to be a peace offering  
made by lions,  
kings of the jungle,  
their hearts trembling at the thought of his might. 4 



विहाय मध्यं यदि लक्ष्मरेखया  
बहिः प्रसार्येत सुधांशुमण्डलम् ।  
दरोदितश्मश्रुकृतश्रियस्तदा  
तदाननेन्दोरुपमानतां व्रजेत् ॥ ५ ॥ 

If its black mark were to slide down  
from the centre to the edge,  
then the moon might come close  
to resembling his moon-like face  
made still more endearing  
by the beard just appearing. 5 



अधारयद्गर्भितरक्तसन्ध्यकं  
नृपात्मजः केशकलापमायतम् ।  
दृढानुरागच्छुरितैर्मृगीदृशा-  
मनुप्रविष्टं हृदयैरिवान्तरा ॥ ६ ॥ 

The Prince had a majestic mane of hair  
interlaced with *raktasandhyaka* flowers –  
as if entwined within it  
were the hearts of doe-eyed ladies,  
daubed with the passion he aroused. 6 



अथैनमासादितयौवनोदयं  
नरेन्द्रकन्याभिरयोजयन्नृपः ।  
घनागमः सम्भृतरत्नसम्पदं  
वरापगाभिर्निधिमम्भसामिव ॥ ७ ॥ 

At length  
the Sovereign wedded his son,  
blooming with the blush of youth,  
to royal maidens –  
just as the coming of the clouds weds the ocean,  
resplendent with a wealth of jewels and gems,  
to great rivers. 7 



अरातिवर्गोन्मथनेन विश्रुतं  
विधातुमत्यन्तविनीतमप्यमुम् ।  
कदाचिदर्थोल्लसितेन भूपतिः  
स वाङ्मयेनैवमुपादिशत् सुतम् ॥ ८ ॥ 

The King wished his son  
to win fame by worsting all his enemies,  
and to perfect his self-mastery.  
One day he counselled him thus  
with words rich in wisdom. 8 



धियः प्रकाशादुपदेशसम्भृतात्  
तमो हि तारुण्यविजृम्भितं जनाः ।  
समुज्झितुं तात भवन्ति पारिता-  
स्तदेतदाकर्णयितुं त्वमर्हसि ॥ ९ ॥ 

‘My son,  
it is by the light of knowledge  
fuelled by friendly advice  
that people have the power to dissipate  
that blinding darkness of budding youth.  
You would do well to heed  
these words of mine. 9 



मुहुःप्रसर्पन्मदमीलितेक्षणाः  
क्षणाधिरोहद्रजसो मलीमसाः ।  
गजा इव स्तम्भनिरुद्धचेतसः  
खला न गृह्णन्ति नियन्तृचोदितम् ॥ १० ॥ 

‘The dissolute are like rutting elephants.  
Both are blind,  
one with a pompous pride,  
the other with streams of rut that form a river.  
Forever in thrall to *rajas*2,  
the men are as depraved  
as the mud-splattered beasts are filthy.  
A mind deadened by overindulgence  
frustrates the libertine;  
a taming post the elephant.  
Neither gives ear to their master. 10 



सहस्रशस्तुङ्गतुरङ्गवीचयो  
मदद्विपद्वीपविशेषितान्तराः ।  
भवन्तमुग्रायुधनक्रराजयो  
भजन्ति नित्यं बहला बलाब्धयः ॥ ११ ॥ 

    

‘Battalions vast as bottomless oceans –  
high-stepping horses as white-cresting waves,  
rutting elephants as abutting islands towering high,  
rows of savage weapons for floats of predatory crocodiles –  
stand in bands of thousands  
ever at the ready for you. 11 



उपेत्य तुण्डीरमखण्डितोद्यमः  
प्रमथ्य चम्पप्रमुखान् रणोन्मुखान् ।  
प्रशाधि काञ्चीमनुवर्तितप्रजः  
पतिर्निधीनामलकापुरीमिव ॥ १२ ॥ 

‘Approach the Tuṇḍīra land  
and finish for once and for all those warriors headed by Campa  
hurling themselves headfirst into battle.  
Rule Kāñcī wisely and win the love of her inhabitants –  
just as Kubera, lord of wealth, rules Alakā. 12 



अथाभिभूताखिलवन्यभूभृत-  
स्तुरुष्कभङ्गस्तव नैव दुष्करः ।  
निगीर्णशाखाशतसंवृतिः कथं  
तरुप्रकाण्डं न दहेद्दवानलः ॥ १३ ॥ 

‘After laying waste every one of the woodland chieftains,  
you’ll crush the Sultan with ease.  
Once a fierce fire has devoured  
the countless small branches providing cover,  
how can it fail to burn down the tree itself?’ 13 



इतीरयित्वा विरते नरेश्वरे  
प्रवृष्टपाथोधरसाम्यधारिणि ।  
कृतप्रणामः शिरसा प्रतीष्टवान्  
गुरूपदेशं गुणिनां पुरःसरः ॥ १४ ॥ 

As a cloud comes to a close after pouring forth its rain  
so did the King after delivering his speech.  
The Prince,  
foremost among the noble,  
prostrated before his father’s feet  
taking to heart his hallowed words. 14 



अथोरगाणामधिपस्य भाविनं  
भुवो भरस्यापगमं दिनेश्वरः ।  
निवेदयिष्यन्निव गाढरंहसा  
रथेन पातालगुहामगाहत ॥ १५ ॥ 

Then the sun –  
wishing as it were  
to tell Śeṣa, lord of serpents,  
that the load of the globe would soon be lightened3 –  
hurried in a flurry of flying chariot  
into the cavern of Pātāla. 15 



अथ नृपसुतः सान्ध्यं निर्माय कर्म सभां गतः  
क्षणमिव गुरोराज्ञां राज्ञां गणाय निवेद्य सः ।  
विमतविजयव्यग्रोत्साहान् विहाय गृहाय ता-  
नरमत सुखी शय्यागेहे सरोजमुखीसखः ॥ १६ ॥ हरिणी 

    

At length, after the prayers of the near-drawing evening,  
the Prince entered the assembly hall.  
In an instant he told the gathered leaders to heed  
his father’s orders.  
Raring to raze their rivals, he bid them head to bed,  
while he in his sleeping quarters  
relaxed with his wives so dear, full of cheer. 16 


Kāma’s banner is emblazoned with a fish. Lines upon the soles of the feet in the form of a fish are one of the signs of a *cakravartī*, a supreme emperor. 

*Rajas* is physical dirt as well as being the *guṇa* or quality characterised by excessive passion.

by the destruction of the oppressive Sultan

अन्येद्युरथ राजीववनजीवनदायिनि ।  
लोकैकदीपे भगवत्युदिते भानुमालिनि ॥ १ ॥ अनुष्टुभ् 

The next day,  
as the solar lord,  
lustrous rejuvenator of lotus clusters,  
single lamp for all three worlds,  
rose, 1 



विहाय निद्रां विधिवन्निर्मिताहर्मुखक्रियः ।  
आदिक्षत् पृतनाध्यक्षान् सेनासन्नहनाय सः ॥ २ ॥ 

the Prince awoke,  
and after performing the prescribed prayers,  
ordered the generals to array the army.  2 



विजृम्भमाणे प्रस्थानशारदारम्भसम्भ्रमे ।  
नृपाणां चामरालीभिर्मरालीभिरभूयत ॥ ३ ॥ 

As the army’s excitement at marching out  
bubbled over  
like the carnival atmosphere at Śarad’s arrival,  
the succession of *cāmaras*  
fanning each king  
became a procession of *haṃsas*. 3 



पोषितो हयहेषाभिर्बृंहितो गजबृंहितैः ।  
वर्धितस्तूर्यनिध्वानैः कोऽपि कोलाहलोऽभवत् ॥ ४ ॥ 

    

Magnified by the neighing of horses,  
triplified by the trumpeting of elephants,  
amplified by the beating of drums,  
a defeaning din broke out. 4 



अथ निर्गत्य भवनादवैक्ष्यत महीक्षिता ।  
धारितस्तोरणाभ्यर्णे तुङ्गस्तुरगपुङ्गवः ॥ ५ ॥ 

As he came out of the palace,  
the King saw his tall, trusted stallion,  
held ready for him near the arched entrance. 5 



जवाधरितजम्भारितुरङ्गभ्रमकारिणम् ।  
मणिकुट्टिमसंक्रान्तमाक्रामन् बिम्बमात्मनः ॥ ६ ॥ 

Standing atop his own reflection,  
deep within the jewel-glazed floor,  
the horse seemed to have subjugated Indra’s steed –  
no match for his speed. 6 



मुखलीनखलीनाहिरच्छपल्ययनच्छदः ।  
वपुषापि गरुत्मन्तमनुगन्तुमिवोत्सुकः ॥ ७ ॥ 

    

The bridle bit idly gripped in his mouth  
was a serpent,  
the neatly stitched saddle  
flapping against his flanks  
was a pair of wings.  
It was as if he wanted to taunt Garuḍa  
by rivalling him in appearance too. 7 



लोलवालाग्रलग्नेन सेव्यमानो नभस्वता ।  
रंहोरहस्यशिक्षार्थं शिष्यतामिव जग्मुषा ॥ ८ ॥ 

It seemed that the wind,  
clinging to the tip of his tremulous tail  
in attendance upon him,  
had become his pupil  
to perfect the secret science of speed. 8 



मुहुः स्वजवसंरोधनमितोन्नमिताननः ।  
नमस्कुर्वन्निव पुरोवर्तिनीं विजयश्रियम् ॥ ९ ॥ 

Impatient to be off  
he tossed his head up and down,  
straining against the reins,  
as though paying his respects  
to the goddess of victory before him. 9 



देहबन्धमिवोत्साहं तमारुह्य महीपतिः ।  
अमंस्त पृथिवीं सर्वामात्मनो हस्तवर्तिनीम् ॥ १० ॥ 

As he mounted this horse –  
or rather his determination  
in the shape of a horse –  
the King felt he held the entire earth  
in the palm of his hand. 10 



अथ कम्पमहीपालः कम्पयन् द्विषतां मनः ।  
प्रातिष्ठत दिशं भेजे मलयाचलमुद्रिताम् ॥ ११ ॥ 

Then King Kampa The Terrifiying,  
terrorising his foes to their very hearts,  
set out and headed in the direction  
marked by Mount Malaya. 11 



रजोभिर्मुहुरुद्धूतैर्लघूभवति भूभरे ।  
कथञ्चित् पृतनाभारं चक्षमे फणिनां पतिः ॥ १२ ॥ 

The dust that his troops kept pounding up  
lightened the load of the globe,  
thus stopping Śeṣa,  
just,  
from collapsing under the army’s weight. 12 



प्रतापादित्यकीर्तीन्दुयुगपद्ग्रासलालसः ।  
परागः परभूपानामुपरागोऽभवन्नवः ॥ १३ ॥ 

    

Endeavouring to devour both sun and moon –  
the fiery heroism and gleaming fame of the King’s enemies –  
simultaneously,  
this cloud of dust became the shroud of an eclipse,  
the likes of which the world has never seen. 13 



पांसुस्थगनलक्षेण पलायत रविः क्वचित् ।  
भावियुद्धामरीभूतवीरोद्दलनशङ्कितः ॥ १४ ॥ 

Using the dust as a screen  
the sun fled to some unknown land,  
terrified of being punctured  
by the heroes destined to win immortality  
in the battle to come.1 14 



वितेनिरे करेणूनां करशीकररेणवः ।  
घनस्य सेनारजसः करकाकारचातुरीम् ॥ १५ ॥ 

The spray spurting from elephants’ trunks  
staged a show of showering hailstones  
as the dust of the army thickened into a cloud. 15 



अथ लङ्घितकर्णाटः पञ्चषैरेव वासरैः ।  
प्रापत् कम्पमहीपालः कण्टकाननपट्टनम् ॥ १६ ॥ 

Then King Kampa,  
having crossed the Karṇāṭa land  
in just five or six days,  
reached the city of Kaṇṭakānana. 16 



स तत्र दिवसान् कांश्चिदतिवाह्य महाबलः।  
अभिषेणयितुं चम्पमुपाक्रमत कालवित् ॥ १७ ॥ 

There that mighty king spent several days  
before he set out to attack Campa,  
carefully choosing his moment. 17 



प्रसृतैस्तच्चमूधूलिस्तोमैः क्षीरतरङ्गिणी ।  
कीर्त्या चम्पक्षितीन्द्रस्य साकं कलुषतामगात् ॥ १८ ॥ 

The billows of dust  
kicked up by the marching troops  
blackened the milk-white waters of the Kṣīrasindhu,  
along with King Campa’s repute. 18 



स दुग्धवाहिनीवीचिमारुताधूतशाखिनि ।  
विरिञ्चिनगराभ्यर्णे न्यवेशयदनीकिनीम् ॥ १९ ॥ 

The Karṇāṭa king stationed his army near Viriñcinagara,  
where the breeze  
from the wave-whipped waters of the Kṣīrasindhu  
rustled the trees. 19 



अथ सन्नद्धसैन्यस्तं न्यरुन्ध द्रमिडाधिपम् ।  
घनीकृतहिमानीको हेमन्त इव भास्करम् ॥ २० ॥ 

Then Kampa,  
army arrayed,  
laid siege to the Dramiḍa king  
just as Hemanta,  
blizzards massed,  
lays siege to the sun. 20 



संवर्तमारुताक्षिप्तसमुद्रद्व‍यसन्निभौ ।  
व्यूहौ द्रमिडकर्णाटनाथयोः सन्निपेततुः ॥ २१ ॥ 

Like two oceans  
hurled together by the gales of *pralaya*,  
the squadrons of the Dramiḍa and Karṇāṭa kings  
crashed upon each other. 21 



रजस्तमसि वीरास्त्रसङ्घसङ्घट्टनोत्थितैः ।  
बभ्रे स्फुलिङ्गसङ्घातैः खद्योतनिवहद्युतिः ॥ २२ ॥ 

    

The millions of sparks that flew forth  
as weapon after weapon of the warring warriors clashed  
lit up  
like so many flashing fireflies  
the dust deepening into dusk. 22 



क्षतजार्द्राः प्रवीराणां प्रेङ्खन्त्यः खड्गलेखिकाः ।  
जिघत्सतः कृतान्तस्य जिह्वा इव विरेजिरे ॥ २३ ॥ 

Swords brandished by brave soldiers,  
slick with blood,  
flicked back and forth  
as if they were the rampaging tongues of ravenous Death. 23 



आस्रापगासु परितो निःसृतासु सहस्रशः ।  
भटानां भल्लनिर्लूनैरम्भोजायितमाननैः ॥ २४ ॥ 

All around  
rivers of blood  
rushing forth in a myriad of reds  
brimmed with lotuses –  
heroes’ heads sliced off by *bhalla* arrows. 24 



वीराः कुञ्जरकुम्भेषु शायिनः शत्रुसायकैः ।  
प्राबुध्यन्त सुरस्त्रीणां कुचकुम्भेषु तत्क्षणात् ॥ २५ ॥ 

Brave soldiers  
put to sleep by the shafts of their foes  
upon pillows formed of elephants’ temples,  
awoke the next moment  
upon pillows formed of *apsarases’* breasts.2 25 



ततः कम्पनरेन्द्रस्य भटैर्भुजबलोत्कटैः ।  
पलायत पराभूता द्रमिडेन्द्रवरूथिनी ॥ २६ ॥ 

King Kampa’s men,  
running wild in their might,  
put to flight  
the forces of the Dramiḍa lord. 26 



हतानुकारिणः केचित् क्षितौ निपतितास्ततः ।  
क्रोष्टुर्भयेन धावन्तः कर्णाटान् पर्यहासयन् ॥ २७ ॥ 

Some dropped down to the ground  
feigning death,  
only to scramble up into a run  
for fear of the jackals –  
provoking the mirth of their Karṇāṭa foes. 27 



विक्षेप्तुं विस्मृतैश्चर्मफलकैर्निर्मितप्लवाः ।  
मृषैव केचिदतरन् मृगतृष्णातरङ्गिणीः ॥ २८ ॥ 

Some seemed to be crossing illusory streams,  
plying paddles formed of the leather shields  
they still unconsciously clutched –  
in vain. 28 



अथ तस्य पुरीमेव नीत्वा शिबिरतां नृपः ।  
अचलं राजगम्भीरमरुन्ध द्विषदाश्रितम् ॥ २९ ॥ 

Finally King Kampa,  
using Campa’s city as his camp,  
laid siege to the Rājagambhīra mountain  
where hid his foe. 29 



प्रवाताभिमुखाधूतैः पताकापाणिपल्लवैः ।  
आरोहणाय राजेन्द्रमाजुहावेव भूधरः ॥ ३० ॥ 

The mountain seemed to beckon the King to ascend,  
motioning him forward  
with frail hands  
formed of flags fluttering in the wind. 30 



अथ प्रववृते युद्धं सेनयोरुभयोरपि ।  
पतदुत्पतदस्त्रांशुज्वलितोर्वीनभःस्थलम् ॥ ३१ ॥ 

Thus was battle joined between the two armies,  
setting aglow both land and sky as  
flying up  
flying down  
missile glanced against missile. 31 



निर्जगाम निजागाराच्चम्पक्ष्मापोऽपि कोपनः ।  
कृपाणपाणिर्वल्मीकाज्जिह्वाल इव जिह्मगः ॥ ३२ ॥ 

The apoplectic Prince Campa  
darted out of his den,  
standing sword in hand,  
like a snake out of an anthill,  
tongue flicking. 32 



अहंपूर्विकया वीरेष्वभितो युद्धकाङ्क्षिषु ।  
प्रत्यग्रहीन्महीपालश्चम्पं सिंह इव द्विपम् ॥ ३३ ॥ 

As battle-thirsty warriors all around him  
jostled with each other  
to deal the first blow,  
the King sprung upon Campa  
as a lion upon an elephant. 33 



अथ वञ्चिततत्खड्गप्रहारः कम्पभूपतिः ।  
अकरोदसिना चम्पममरेन्द्रपुरातिथिम् ॥ ३४ ॥ 

At that moment King Kampa,  
dodging Campa’s blow,  
made him  
with a stroke of his own sword  
a guest of Indra in heaven. 34 



इत्थं सङ्गरमूर्ध्नि चम्पनृपतिं नीत्वा कथाशेषतां  
श्रीमान् कम्पनृपेश्वरो जनयितुः सम्प्राप्तवान् शासनम् ।  
काञ्चीन्यस्तजयप्रशस्तिरमिथःसङ्कीर्णवर्णाश्रमं  
नीत्या नित्यनिरत्ययर्द्धिरशिषत् तुण्डीरभूमण्डलम् ॥ ३५ ॥ शार्दूलविक्रीडितम् 

Thus in the thick of the battle the glorious monarch Kampa,  
carrying out his father’s orders,  
relegated Campa to the realm of memory.  
Issuing a proclamation of victory in Kāñcī  
he governed the Tuṇḍīra land,  
keeping *varṇas* and *āśramas* intact3,  
the wisdom of his rule securing him  
a prosperity permanent and perfect. 35 


Those killed fighting bravely go straight to heaven, breaking through the sun.

The poetess is here playing on the word *‘kumbha’* \(an elephant's temple as well as a pitcher, and by extension a pitcher-shaped breast\) to bring out how fast brave warriors arrive in heaven.

Strictly maintaining the fourfold division of society into *varṇas* and of each individual’s life into *āśramas* was an important royal duty.

**FIFTH CANTO**





अथ स तत्र महीतलमण्डने  
मरकताह्वयभाजि महापुरे ।  
विरचितस्थितिरप्रतिशासनं  
जगदशेषमरक्षदनाकुलम् ॥ १ ॥ द्रुतविलम्बितम् 

Establishing himself by and by there in Marakata,  
a magnificent metropolis adorning Mother Earth,  
the King governed the whole land,  
challenged by none,  
bringing peace to his subjects. 1 



नरपतेः प्रतिहारमहीं मुहु-  
र्विजयदन्तिमदोदकपङ्किलाम् ।  
क्षितिभुजां भुजभूषणघट्टन-  
प्रसृमरो मणिरेणुरशोषयत् ॥ २ ॥ 

    

At the threshold to the Prince’s palace,  
the jewelled dust billowing forth  
every day  
as kings jostled,  
bracelet brushing against bracelet,  
dried up the slush created by the springs of ichor  
streaming from war elephants. 2 



अथ सुगन्धिहिमान् व्यजनानिलान्  
मृगदृशः कृतचन्दनचर्चिकाः ।  
शशिमतीश्च निशाः प्रियतां नय-  
न्नरपतेरुदभूदृतुरूष्मलः ॥ ३ ॥ 

It was then that Grīṣma came,  
leading the King to revel in  
breaths of air chill and fragrant from fans,  
doe-eyed women smeared with sandalwood,  
nights aglint with the moon. 3 



नियतिनिर्मितदक्षिणदिग्वधू-  
विरहतापनिवारणवाञ्छ‍या ।  
अहिमभानुरहन्यहनि ध्रुवं  
हरितमाप हिमाचलशीतलाम् ॥ ४ ॥ 

    

Forcibly parted from his sweetheart the South  
by destiny’s decree,  
and longing to allay his love-burn,  
as it were,  
day after day  
the hot-rayed sun  
steered a steady course  
for the Himālaya-cooled North.1 4 



सरसचन्दनधारिषु मौक्तिक-  
त्रिसरनिर्झरहारिषु सुभ्रुवाम् ।  
कुचतटेषु निदाघनिपीडितो  
धृतिमगात् कुसुमायुधकुञ्जरः ।। ५ ॥ 

The formidable elephant that was the flower-arrowed Kāma,  
scorched by the summer heat  
found relief upon the slopes of beautiful women’s breasts,  
home to refreshing sandal  
and entrancing rivulets  
trickling down in pearl-string triplets. 5 



सलिलकेलिकुतूहलकुन्तली-  
कुचतटाहतिजातभयैरिव ।  
अपसृतैरजनि प्रतिवासरं  
नृपतिगेहविहारसरोजलैः ॥ ६ ॥ 

    

Every day  
the waters of the palaces’ lakes  
shrank a little further away  
beaten into terror by the sloping breasts  
of the ladies of that land  
larking about lithely as they bathed. 6 



अथ दलन्निचुलद्रुममञ्जरी-  
निचयदर्शितचामरविभ्रमः ।  
कृतनुतिः किल चातकयाचकै-  
र्नृपतिमन्वगमज्जलदागमः ॥ ७ ॥ 

Then came the coming of the rains,  
impersonating the King:  
*camara* fly-whisks in the *nicula* blossom  
into clusters bursting;  
suppliants in the *cātaka* birds,  
words of praise ever singing.2 7 



स्फुटतटित्तपनीयगुणोज्ज्वलैः  
पृथुपयःकणमौक्तिकसङ्गिभिः ।  
अलिकदम्बकसच्छविभिर्दिशा-  
मसितकञ्चुलिकायितमम्बुदैः ॥ ८ ॥ 

The directions wore a dark blouse  
made of bee-black clouds  
aglitter with a golden lacework of lightning,  
and studded with pearls formed of rounded rain drops. 8 



हरितलोहितपाण्डुरराजत  
त्रिदशराजशरासनलेखिका ।  
मरकतोपलविद्रुममौक्तिकै-  
र्विरचिता रशनेव नभःश्रियः ॥ ९ ॥ 

A sleek streak of rainbow  
gleaming green, red and white  
seemed to be the sky’s girdle-string,  
embroidered with emerald, coral and pearl. 9 



रुधिरबिन्दुनिभच्छविरन्वगात्  
क्षितितले हरिगोपपरम्परा ।  
घनघरट्टपरस्परघट्टन-  
क्षरदिरम्मदवह्निकणावलिम् ॥ १० ॥ 

    

Innumerable *indragopas*,  
bright red as pricks of blood,  
seemed to be  
a shower of lightning sparks pouring down to earth  
as cloud ground against stone cloud. 10 



पटुपुरःपवनाधिगतभ्रमा  
जलमुचः करकोपलकैतवात् ।  
सलिलराशिपयःसहचूषिता-  
मुदवमन्निव मौक्तिकसंहतिम् ॥ ११ ॥ 

Wheeling in the wild head-winds,  
clouds seemed to spew out,  
disguised as dazzling hailstones,  
a mouthful of pearls  
sucked up when they swallowed the sea’s salt water. 11 



करतलैरिव गन्धवहैर्घनाः  
प्रहितकैतकपांसुविभूतयः ।  
स्तनितहुङ्कृतिभिर्निरकासय-  
न्नृपतियौवतमानमहाग्रहम् ॥ १२ ॥ 

Flinging the sacred ash of *ketakī* pollen  
from gusts of wind running together to form upraised palms,  
and roaring ‘hum’ with each thunderclap3,  
the clouds exorcised the spirit of spite  
possessing the King’s young wives. 12 



तदनु पद्मवनीपरिहासक-  
स्त्रिदशनाथशरासनतस्करः ।  
भुजगभुङ्मुखमुद्रणभौरिकः  
समुदभूत् समयो जलदात्ययः ॥ १३ ॥ 

After that arrived Śarad –  
clown to clusters of lotuses,  
robber of rainbows,  
treasurer sealing tight the talkative tongues of peacocks4. 13 



विधुतकाशसटाभरभासुरः  
प्रकटितोरुजपारुणलोचनः ।  
व्यघटयद् घनदन्तिघटाः स्फुर-  
द्रविमुखः शरदागमकेसरी ॥ १४ ॥ 

Arriving as a lion –  
splendid as he shakes out his full mane of *kāśa* grass,  
bloodshot eyes in *japā* flowers,  
his face the effulgent sun –  
Śarad sundered the squadrons of elephant-shaped clouds. 14 



जलदकालकलिस्फुरितां शनैः  
कलुषतां प्रशमय्य कृशाः पुनः ।  
घटयति स्म शरत् तटिनीसखी-  
रुपनतैः कलहंसविलासिभिः ॥ १५ ॥ 

Soothing bit by bit their turmoil  
stirred up by the raging row of the monsoon,  
Śarad re-united her friends the rivers  
grown gaunt  
with their lovers the *haṃsas*  
newly returned. 15 



विकचपद्मविलोचनमात्मनो  
मुखमवेक्षितुमात्तकुतूहला ।  
नियतमभ्रनिचोलकगर्भतः  
शरदकर्षदहर्पतिदर्पणम् ॥ १६ ॥ 

Śarad drew her mirror,  
the iridescent sun,  
out of a clutch made of clouds,  
clearly eager to admire herself  
as the lotuses of her eyes burst into bloom. 16 



वनभुवः परितः पवनेरितै-  
र्नवजपाकुसुमैः कृतदीपिकाः ।  
प्रथममेव नृपस्य निदेशतो  
विजयिनस्तुरगान् निरराजयन् ॥ १७ ॥ 

Before the King had even given the order,  
the forest groves all around,  
scribing circles with oil lamps  
in the fresh *japā* flowers fluttered about by the wind,  
performed an arati ceremony5  
for his ever-victorious horses. 17 



अथ नृपस्य समुत्सुकचेतसो  
मदनकेलिकलासु विलासिनः ।  
प्रियमिवाचरितुं समुपागमत्  
प्रगुणयन् क्षणदास्तुहिनागमः ॥ १८ ॥ 

Next in order came Hemanta,  
lengthening the nights  
as if to please the passion-fired King  
who longed for lovemaking. 18 



हिमभरैर्विहतः कमलाकरो  
मृदितकान्तिरभून्मृगलाञ्छनः ।  
वदनमेव नरेन्द्रनतभ्रुवा-  
मभजत श्रियमप्रतिशासनाम् ॥ १९ ॥ 

The lotus pond was blasted by thick frost.  
The moon was robbed of its magnificence.  
The faces of the King’s beloveds  
of bow-curved brows  
alone suffered no threat to their beauty. 19 



विकचकुन्दकलापपरिष्क्रिया-  
विरचितालकजालकविभ्रमम् ।  
असमयेऽपि समौक्तिकमण्डनं  
प्रभुरमंस्त निजं प्रमदाजनम् ॥ २० ॥ 

The Lord thought his ladies,  
their furled curls prettily decorated  
with bunches of budding *kunda* blooms,  
were wearing pearls  
in spite of the season. 20 



इति सुखान्युचितानि हिमागमे  
समनुभूय मनोभवसन्निभः ।  
शिशिरयामवतीष्वपि रागवान्  
रमयितुं रमणीरुदयुङ्क्त सः ॥ २१ ॥ 

Thus the King,  
Love himself in human form,  
had his fill of Hemanta’s delights.  
Lust-lit,  
he led his lovers to lovemaking  
on Śiśira nights too. 21 



अपदिशञ्छिशिरानिलमङ्गकैः  
पुलकितैर्नृपतेः सविधं गतः ।  
मदनसम्भृतघर्मपयःकणै-  
र्भृशमलज्जत मुग्धवधूजनः ॥ २२ ॥ 

As they came to him,  
his young wives tried to blame their goosebumped limbs  
on the breeze blowing cold.  
They blushed furiously  
when trickles of sweat revealed their arousal. 22 



उपहरन् कुसुमानि महीरुहां  
किसलयैः कलिताञ्जलिबन्धनः ।  
मधुरकोकिलकूजितभाषितो  
मधुरथैनमुपासितुमासदत् ॥ २३ ॥ 

Offering him flowers from the trees,  
raising his hands in a *namaskāra*  
formed of fresh leaves still furled,  
the honey-sweet singing of koels serving as hymns of praise –  
the honeyed season of Vasanta then waited upon the King. 23 



उपवनेष्वगमन्नुपमेयतां  
स्फुटरुचो नवकिंशुककुट्मलाः ।  
मथितपान्थमृगक्षतजारुणै-  
र्मदनकेसरिणः कुटिलैर्नखैः ॥ २४ ॥ 

In gardens and groves  
the just blooming buds of the *kiṃśuka*  
dazzlingly bright  
looked like the curved claws of Kāma the lion,  
red with the blood of his traveller prey  
freshly slayed.6 24 



चटुलषट्पदकज्जलपातिनी  
विरुरुचे नवचम्पकमञ्जरी ।  
प्रकटितेव हिमापगमश्रिया  
स्मरमहोत्सवदीपपरम्परा ॥ २५ ॥ 

A row of fresh *campaka* flowers,  
shedding soot in the skittery bees,  
seemed to be a line of oil lamps  
lit by the lady of Vasanta  
to celebrate the grand festival of Kāma. 25 



सुतनवः फलकेषु मधूत्सवे  
रतिपतिं परिलेखितुमुद्यताः ।  
हृदयगोचरतामनिशं गतं  
हरिहरात्मजमेव7 समालिखन् ॥ २६ ॥ 

In the festival of Vasanta,  
his pretty wives attempted to paint Rati’s prince  
upon their picture boards,  
but found themselves drawing the King  
for it was he who dwelt eternally in their hearts. 26 



क्षितिपतिं किल कुङ्कुममुष्टिना  
समभिताडयितुं धियमादधौ ।  
सपदि घर्मपयःप्रसरेण तं  
विगलितं न विवेद वधूजनः ॥ २७ ॥ 

Making up their minds  
to fling fistfuls of fine *kuṅkuma*  
at their lord,  
his darlings did not discern that  
the powder had become a trickle of liquid  
the second it met their sweat-wetted hands. 27 



इति समुपचिताभिश्चातुरीभिर्विशेषा-  
नृतुषु समुपलभ्यान्निर्विशन्निर्विशङ्कम् ।  
सुतनुभिरवियोगोत्कण्ठिताभिस्तृतीयं  
व्यतनुत पुरुषार्थं कम्पराजः कृतार्थम् ॥ २८ ॥ मालिनी 

Thus with an ease born of practice  
King Kampa enjoyed the specialities  
on offer in each season,  
ever revelling carefree  
in the company of his handsome wives  
who knew not the painful longing of separation.  
In doing so he lent significance  
to the pursuit of pleasure,  
the third goal of human existence. 28 


The sun travels south for half of the year and north for the other half.

The association, seen throughout this canto, of certain flora and fauna with each season follows poetic convention.

These three actions imitate elements of an exorcism ceremony.

After dancing and singing all monsoon, peacocks fall silent in Śarad.

in which lamps are swung in clockwise circles in front of the deity

Separated from their lovers, travellers suffer keenly the effects of Kāma in Vasanta.

the King set out to the pleasure grove  
to pass the time in picking flowers  
with his graceful queens –  
just as the noble Indra sets out for his garden Nandana  
with heaven’s beauties. 1 



मुखरितमणिमेखलाकलापाः  
प्रचलितमन्वचलंस्तमायताक्ष्यः ।  
उपवनलतिका इवोपगीत-  
भ्रमरकुला मलयाद्रिगन्धवाहम् ॥ २ ॥ 

As he strode ahead,  
the oval-eyed ladies,  
jingling with jewel-girt girdles,  
trailed in his wake –  
just as garden creepers,  
humming with bees,  
trail the Malaya breeze. 2 



अजनयदवनीश्वरस्य चेत-  
स्यसितदृशां मणिनूपुरप्रणादः ।  
सहपरिचलितप्रसूनकेतो-  
रवनमदैक्षवचापघोषशङ्काम् ॥ ३ ॥ 

The King mistook  
the peal of the ornamented anklets  
worn by the dark-eyed girls  
for the sound of the sugarcane bow  
as if Kāma,  
moving among them,  
were readying his aim. 3 



अवनिपतिमनु प्रतस्थुषीणां  
हरिणदृशामितरेतरप्रसक्ताः ।  
मधुरसमधुरा गिरस्तदानीं  
बहुविधभङ्गितरङ्गिता बभूवुः ॥ ४ ॥ 

    

As they followed their lord,  
the doe-eyed women,  
voices sweet as seeping honey,  
chattered each to her neighbour,  
their many-wayed words like waves. 4 



वरतनु परतः प्रयाहि मन्दं  
हरिणदृशां पुरतः प्रयायिनीनाम् ।  
पथि गतिरयशीर्णहारमुक्ता-  
मणिगणशर्करिले पदं न कुर्याः ॥ ५ ॥ 

‘Step to the side there –  
slowly now, my love\!  
Mind you don’t tread here –  
the plenteous pearl necklaces coming loose  
as the doe-eyed women ahead pick up pace  
are making a gravel of the place.’ 5 



नलिनमुखि न बोधय प्रसुप्ता-  
निह मणिनूपुरशिञ्जितेन हंसान् ।  
द्रुतगमनविघातमाचरेयु-  
र्नियतममी तव पादपद्मलग्नाः ॥ ६ ॥ 

‘Look out, lady of the lotus face\!  
Don’t awaken the *haṃsas*  
fast asleep here  
with the ringing of your jewelled anklets.  
They’d be sure to cling to your feet,  
which look so like lotuses,  
and stop you from hurrying ahead.’1 6 



करनखरमरीचिमञ्जरीभि-  
र्हतहृदयो जलशङ्क‍या कुरङ्गः ।  
अनुपतति विलोकयैकवारं  
सखि नियतं स निवर्तते विलक्षः ॥ ७ ॥ 

‘An antelope is following you,  
hopelessly hypnotised  
by the shimmering sheen of your fingernails,  
which he takes to be water.  
Oh do have a look, dear\!  
He has scampered off,  
evidently embarrassed.’ 7 



शशिमुखि शशिकान्तकुट्टिमेषु  
स्खलनभिया न पदात् पदं प्रयासि ।  
इयमिह वदनानुबिम्बराजि-  
स्तव न पुनर्नवपङ्कजोपाहरः ॥ ८ ॥ 

‘Is it for fear of slipping  
on the moonstone-paved path,  
my moon-faced girl,  
that you falter over footstep after footstep?2  
And this is the reflection  
repeated over and over  
of your own face;  
not a fresh offering of blown lotus flowers.’ 8 


*Our text breaks off shortly after this verse and resumes with Kampa playing games with his wives in a lake. *


अवनिपतिरसिक्त दीर्घिकायां  
मुखकमलं सलिलेन साभिलाषम् ।  
किमपि समधिकार्द्रपक्ष्मलेखं  
वदनमभूदरुणेक्षणं परस्याः ॥ ९ ॥ 

The King,  
lusting after one girl,  
splashed her lotus face with water.  
But it was another whose  
eyelashes ran wet  
and eyes turned red. 9 



सलिलहतिभियापवृत्तगात्र्याः  
प्रचलितवेण्यपराङ्गकं परस्याः ।  
धरणिपतिरमंस्त मीनकेतोः  
फलकमुपाहितखड्गवल्लरीकम् ॥१० ॥ 

As another girl turned away,  
fearing a slap of water,  
the King believed the braid whipping across her back  
was the fish-bannered Kāma’s sword  
swinging across his shield. 10 



विशदमधरमक्ष्यनञ्जनाभं  
विगतललाम वितन्वती ललाटम् ।  
रतिरिव जलकेलिरङ्गनाना-  
मवनिपतेः स्पृहणियतामयासीत् ॥ ११ ॥ 

Wiping the paint from his wives’ lips,  
the alluring collyrium from their eyes  
and the decorative dot forthwith from their foreheads –  
just as lovemaking does –  
these watersports enthralled the King. 11 



अपि दयिततमेन वारिताभि-  
र्गृहसरसो विजहे न वारि ताभिः ।  
परिलुलितललामचर्चिकाभि-  
र्विहृतिरसान्महिलामचर्चिकाभिः ॥ १२ ॥ 

    

Though many a time did their beloved ask,  
they left not their much-loved bask,  
their *tilaka* and sandal paste in every way faded,  
those beautiful wives of his in no way jaded. 12 



अथ विहरणखेदमन्थराभिः  
सह निरगात्सरसो नृपः प्रियाभिः ।  
कलशजलनिधेरिवाप्सरोभि-  
र्विबुधतरुर्मथनश्रमालसाभिः ॥ १३ ॥ 

At length from the water the Lord with his lovers emerged  
after their energetic play exhausted,  
just as  
from the milk sea the divine tree with the *apsarases* surfaced  
after such frenetic churning fatigued. 13 



चिकुरनियमनेषु कामिनीना-  
मभिनववस्त्रपरिग्रहान्तरेषु ।  
अभिमतपददर्शनैरयत्नै-  
रतिमदनं स्वममंस्त कम्पराजः ॥ १४ ॥ 

As his voluptuous wives tied their hair  
and changed into fresh clothes,  
King Kampa considered himself luckier than Kāma  
to be granted a glimpse  
of those spots he longed to see,  
without lifting a finger. 14 



ततः सैरन्ध्रीभिः कृतसमुचिताकल्परचनः  
पुरन्ध्रीभिः सार्धं समधिगतशुद्धान्तवसतिः ।  
त्रयीगीतं तेजस्त्रिपुरहरमाराध्य विधिव-  
द्यथार्हैर्व्यापारैर्नरपतिरहःशेषमनयत् ॥ १५ ॥ शिखरिणी 

Then the King, suitably attired by the dress-maidens,  
entered the inner quarters with the eldest matrons.  
There he worshipped,  
in accordance with *śāstra*,  
the divine light to whom the triple *Vedas* pay tribute,  
tormentor of Tripura3,  
and spent the rest of the day in fitting occupations. 15 


*Haṃsas* are attracted to the sound of anklets as well as being fond of lotuses.

Moonstones ooze water upon seeing the moon.

**सप्तमः सर्गः**

**SEVENTH CANTO**





अथ कम्पनरेन्द्रसुभ्रुवां  
मुखपद्मान्यनुहार्य पङ्कजैः ।  
अपराधभियेव भानुमा-  
नपरक्ष्माधरकन्दरामगात् ॥ १ ॥ वियोगिनी 

At that point the sun,  
as if filled with terror  
at the crime he had committed  
in trying to make lotuses as radiant  
as the lotus-faces of the King’s wives,  
scurried to a cave  
buried deep in the setting mountain. 1 



परिचूषितदीप्तिरम्बुजैः  
पुनरूष्माणमिवाप्तुमौर्वतः ।  
रयवल्गितवाहनो रविः  
पयसां राशिमवाप पश्चिमम् ॥ २ ॥ 

    

Sucked clean of energy by lotuses,  
swiftly sank the sun into the western sea,  
chariot reverberating as he raced downwards,  
seemingly to replenish his heat from the fire in the deep.1 2 



तरणेररुणीकृताः करै-  
र्वरुणस्त्रैणकपोलभित्तयः ।  
मदलोहिनिकामुपावहन्  
मदिरास्वादनमन्तराप्यहो ॥ ३ ॥ 

The full cheeks of Varuṇa’s wives,  
reddened by the rays of the setting sun,  
took on the rosy flush of wine  
though they had not  
touched a drop.2 3 



प्रथमां हरितं प्रभाकरो  
विरहय्यात्मनि तापमाप यम् ।  
अपरामुपगम्य तं जहौ  
हृदयं कः खलु वेत्ति रागिणाम् ॥ ४ ॥ 

The scorching torment the sun suffered  
in parting from his first lover, the East,  
vanished in the arms of the next, the West.  
Who can fathom the hearts of those red-hot with passion? 4 



प्रतिबिम्बपरम्पराम्बुधौ  
पवनोद्धूततरङ्गसङ्गिनी ।  
नभसोऽवतरिष्यतो रवे-  
र्मणिसोपानधियं व्यभावयत् ॥ ५ ॥ 

The sun’s reflection,  
repeated over and over  
upon the wave-scored surface of the wind-stirred sea,  
looked like a ruby staircase  
readied for him to descend from the heavens. 5 



उदधौ पतितस्य भास्वतः  
कतिभिश्चित् किरणैः खवर्तिभिः ।  
उदपाद्यत कालकुञ्जरो-  
द्दलिताहर्द्रुमशाखिकाभ्रमः ॥ ६ ॥ 

As the sun plunged into the ocean,  
the few sunbeams still suspended in the sky  
seemed to be the strewn branches  
torn from the tree of day  
by the tusker of Time. 6 



गतदीप्ति गभस्तिमालिनो  
विलुठद्वीचिषु बिम्बमम्बुधेः ।  
शफराः पलखण्डशङ्क‍या  
रसनाभिर्लिलिहुर्मुहुर्मुहुः ॥ ७ ॥ 

    

As the ray-rich sun’s radiance-robbed disc  
wobbled from wave to wave,  
fish fancied it a piece of meat,  
licking at it with flicking tongues. 7 



घटमानदलाररीपुटं  
नलिनं मन्दिरमिन्दिरास्पदम् ।  
परिपालयति स्म निक्वणन्  
परितो यामिकवन्मधुव्रतः ॥ ८ ॥ 

Whistling all the while,  
the bee,  
like a sentry on night-watch,  
patrolled the lotus flower –  
the tower which was Lakṣmī’s bower3–  
as each petal-door was pulled to. 8 



अधिपङ्कजकोशमादधे  
बहिरालीनमधुव्रतच्छलात् ।  
मधुसौरभरक्षणोत्सुका  
दिनलक्ष्मीरिव लक्ष्म जातुषम् ॥ ९ ॥ 

The day herself  
seemed to place upon the lotus bud –  
a casket in which she was anxious  
to keep both nectar and scent safe –  
a lac-dark seal in the bee clinging to its edge. 9 



दिनवेषमपास्य यामिनी-  
वपुषा कालनटस्य नृत्यतः ।  
ददृशे जगता पितृप्रसू-  
र्दिवि नेपथ्यपटीव पाटला ॥ १० ॥ 

To those on earth  
the glow of the evening sky  
seemed to be the crimson curtain  
drawn during the dance of the actor Time,  
as he changed from playing day  
to assume the role of night. 10 



वियति व्यरुचन् पयोधराः  
स्फुटसन्ध्यापरिपाटलत्विषः ।  
अचिरावतरद्विभावरी-  
पदलाक्षापटलानुकारिणः ॥ ११ ॥ 

In the sky shone the clouds,  
dyed a deep red by the twilight,  
as if freshly stained  
by a procession of lac-pink footprints  
as the dark dame, night, descended. 11 



उदियाय ततो दिगङ्गना-  
श्रवणाकल्पतमालपल्लवः ।  
रजनीमुखपत्रलेखिका-  
रचनारङ्कुमदस्तमोऽङ्कुरः ॥ १२ ॥ 

Then arose a sliver of darkness –  
a *tamāla* leaf earring  
for the ladies of the directions;  
a decorative design  
in musk-drawn lines  
upon the face of the evening sky4. 12 



नयनानि जनस्य तत्क्षणा-  
न्निरुणद्धि स्म निरन्तरं तमः ।  
रविदीपभृताभ्रकर्पर-  
च्युतकालाञ्जनपुञ्जमेचकम् ॥ १३ ॥ 

In a moment,  
solid darkness shrouded people’s sight –  
a darkened mass of blackened soot  
falling from the dome of the sky  
where it had collected  
as the lamp of the sun below it burnt.5 13 



तदमंसत मांसलं तम-  
स्तनुतारागणबिन्दुजालकम् ।  
दिवसात्ययचण्डताण्डव-  
च्युतमीशस्य गजाजिनं जनाः ॥ १४ ॥ 

    

People deemed the dense darkness,  
dotted with a legion of slender stars,  
to be the fresh-flayed elephant hide  
fallen from Śiva’s shoulders  
as round and round he went in his vehement *tāṇḍava*  
at day’s end. 14 



अवपत् किमु कालकर्षक-  
स्तिमिराम्भःकलुषे नभस्तले ।  
विमलामुडुबीजमण्डलीं  
नवचन्द्रातपसस्यसिद्ध‍ये ॥ १५ ॥ 

Has the tiller Time  
sown upon the surface of the sky –  
watered with darkness to a rich, black mud –  
a patch of pristine seed-stars  
to cultivate a crop of fresh moonlight? 15 



अहरत्ययरागपल्लव-  
स्तमसा कन्दलितो नभस्तरुः ।  
सृजति स्म निरन्तरं हरि-  
द्विटपैस्तारककोरकावलिम् ॥ १६ ॥ 

The sky was a tree:  
the new shoots were the red streaks of the dying day,  
the thick foliage they grew into was the darkness,  
and at length the tree’s branches,  
the directions,  
began to burst into an unceasing series of flower-stars. 16 



अगमन्नभिसारिकाः प्रिया-  
ननुरागाञ्जनरञ्जितेक्षणाः ।  
अभिनत्तिमिरेऽपि ताः पुनः  
श्वसितेनैव सुगन्धिना जनः ॥ १७ ॥ 

Departed for their lovers’ houses  
*abhisārikās*, eyes lined with love’s magical *kajjala*.  
Revealed were they even in the darkness  
to wayfarers, by their breath so sweetly scented. 17 



जननीमुपलभ्य यामिनी-  
मधिकस्नेहदशाभिवर्धिताः ।  
दिवसस्य लयं प्रपेदुषो  
गृहदीपा मुहुरर्भका इव ॥ १८ ॥ 

Upon the demise of the day,  
the lamps in each house,  
his orphaned children as it were,  
turned to their mother the night  
and grew strong with the oil of love she lavished upon them. 18 



तदनु क्षणदागमोल्लस-  
त्कलशाम्भोनिधिवीचिरोचिषः ।  
व्यरुचन् कतिचित् कराङ्कुराः  
शशिनः शातमखे दिशामुखे ॥ १९ ॥ 

    

After that  
there shone in the East,  
where lives Lord Indra of many a sacrificial feast,  
a smattering of soft moonbeams  
pale as the whitened waves of the milky ocean  
surging in jubilance at the onset of the night6. 19 



तरलालसतारकं मुखं  
कलयन्ती शरकाण्डपाण्डरम् ।  
विगलत्तिमिराम्बरा बभौ  
हरिदैन्द्री हरिणाङ्कगर्भिणी ॥ २० ॥ 

The Eastern zone,  
pregnant with the moon full grown,  
was resplendent:  
her star-eyes now glowing bright now growing dim  
her face the shade of a blade of *śara* grass,  
and her dress of darkness slipping off. 20 



अथ किञ्चिददृश्यतैन्दवं  
वपुराद्रोदयरागलोहितम् ।  
बलशासनदिग्विलासिनी-  
मुखसिन्दूरललामकोमलम् ॥ २१ ॥ 

Then the orb of the moon  
started to show itself,  
reddened to crimson by its recent rise,  
a delicate dot of *sindūra*  
on the face of the Eastern quarter,  
Indra’s beloved. 21 



परिपिण्डितयावकारुणं  
प्रचकाशे हिमरश्मिमण्डलम् ।  
रचितं नवरक्तसन्ध्यकै-  
र्विजयच्छत्रमिवात्मजन्मनः ॥ २२ ॥ 

Red as a rounded ball of lac,  
the lunar orb looked like  
a royal parasol  
wreathed with *raktasandhyakas* freshly blooming  
for the triumphant Kāma. 22 



अथ कम्पनृपोऽपि कृत्यवित्  
कृतसन्ध्यासमयोचितक्रियः ।  
अवदत् सविधे स्थितां प्रियां  
भुवि गङ्गेत्यभिनन्दिताह्वयाम् ॥ २३ ॥ 

King Kampa,  
after completing the customary *sandhyā* ceremony,  
conscientous as ever,  
then turned to speak to the wife he so loved,  
she who was known to the world as Gaṅgā7. 23 



कमलाक्षि कटाक्ष्यतामयं  
समयो वर्णनया रसार्द्रया ।  
जन एष वचस्तवामृतं  
श्रवसा पाययितुं कुतूहली ॥ २४ ॥ 

‘My lotus-eyed love,  
pay homage to this hour  
with a description steeped in *rasa*.  
He that stands before you  
longs to drink in the *amṛta* of your words  
with his ears.’ 24 



इति सा दयितेन भाषिता  
दरनम्रं दधती मुखाम्बुजम् ।  
वदति स्म शनैः शुचिस्मिता  
सरसोदारपदां सरस्वतीम् ॥ २५ ॥ 

Addressed thus by her lover,  
she lowered her lotus face a little,  
smiling shyly,  
and in measured cadence  
started to speak words to inspire wonder and wisdom. 25 



स्वदमानसुगन्धिमारुतः  
प्रसरत्कोमलचन्द्रिकोदयः ।  
नृपचन्द्र निरीक्ष्यतामयं  
समयः पोषितपुष्पसायकः ॥ २६ ॥ 

‘O moon among kings,  
how magical is this hour\!  
Sweetly scented blows the breeze,  
velvety moonbeams wander all about  
and Love of the flower-shafts flourishes. 26 



परिरभ्य दृढं चिरागतः  
प्रथमाशासुदृशां निशापतिः ।  
श्लथयत्ययमंशुभिर्नखै-  
स्तिमिरश्रेणिमयीं प्रवेणिकाम् ॥ २७ ॥ 

‘See how the moon  
after a long absence  
clasps the lovely-eyed lady of the East  
in a tight embrace,  
and undoes her simply tied tresses –  
tangles of darkness –  
combing it through with the fingernails of his rays. 27 



प्रथमाचलमौलिमुच्चकै-  
रधिरुह्याम्बरपात्रसम्भृतम् ।  
अयमंशुमृणालिकामुखै-  
स्तिमिरं चूषयतीव चन्द्रमाः ॥ २८ ॥ 

‘Ascending the soaring summit of the rising mountain,  
the moon seems to suck up the darkness  
collected in the goblet of the sky  
with his rays as lotus-stalk straws. 28 



अलिनीलमयस्तमोमयं  
प्रविलाप्योदयरागवह्निना ।  
कलयत्ययमोषधीश्वरः।  
कलधौतं शुचि कौमुदीमिषात् ॥ २९ ॥ 

‘Master chemist that he is,  
the moon melts down the bee-black iron of darkness  
in the red-orange blaze of his rise  
forging pure silver  
formed in moonlight’s image. 29 



मुहुरामृशदेव पद्मिनी-  
मपि रागी क्षणदाकरः करैः ।  
यदमुं प्रति नेयमुन्मुखी  
प्रभवत्यत्र पतिव्रतागुणः ॥ ३० ॥ 

‘Flushed pink with desire,  
night after night  
the moon shrinks not from stroking even the lotus  
with rays as roving hands.  
Yet still she refuses so much as to look at him –  
what firm-founded fidelity\!8 30 



अलिविभ्रममन्तरेति य-  
न्न विधोस्तन्मृगलक्ष्म किन्त्वयम् ।  
पुरजिद्रथचक्रतार्जितो  
बहलः कज्जललेपकालिमा ॥ ३१ ॥ 

‘This deer etched within the moon –  
black as a bee –  
is no such thing.  
It is rather a dark mark  
from the grinding of the generously greased axel  
when the moon became a chariot wheel  
for Śiva, conqueror of Tripura. 31 



मघवन्मणिभङ्गमेचकः  
शशिनि श्यामलिमा चकास्ति यः ।  
जनयत्ययमङ्कपालिका-  
प्रणयालीननिशीथिनीधियम् ॥ ३२ ॥ 

‘This deep blue darkness,  
shining like a shard of sapphire within the moon,  
makes you think  
night has melted into his loving embrace.’ 32 


*The remainder of this canto and the beginning of the next are lost. *

A fire-breathing mare lives in the ocean.

Varuṇa, lord of the sea, presides over the western direction.

Lakṣmī here is both the goddess and wealth.

Floral patterns were drawn upon women’s faces for decoration.

Soot used to be collected in an inverted semi-circular receptacle hanging above a lamp.

It is at night that the moon rises, causing the sea to swell.

Our poetess, we assume

Lotuses bloom only in the presence of their lord, the sun.

the Yavanas’ catalogue of crimes  
condemned by all,  
she1 produced  
with her prodigious powers  
a terrifying sword. 10 



तमरातिनराधिनाथनारी-  
नयनाम्भःकणपातहेतुभूतम् ।  
प्रभुरुन्मिषितस्वरोषवह्ने-  
रधिकोद्दामममंस्त धूमदण्डम् ॥ ११ ॥ 

    

To the King,  
it was a fearsome column of smoke curling up  
from the fire of his flaring anger,  
making tears drip from  
the lashes of the ladies of lords  
who raised against him swords. 11 



प्रणयागतचोलपाण्ड्यलक्ष्मी-  
श्रवणेन्दीवरमालिकायमानम् ।  
विरचय्य पुरः कृपाणमेषा  
पुनरप्याह पुरन्दराभमेनम् ॥ १२ ॥ 

This sword was a string of blue lilies adorning the ears  
of the tutelary goddesses of the Colas and Pāṇḍyas,  
who had turned to Kampa in their love.  
Placing it before the doughty king,  
daring as Indra, destroyer of cities,  
she spoke once again. 12 



नरनाथ पुरा कृपाणमेनं  
विरचय्याखिलदेवतायुधांशैः ।  
उपदीकृतवान् पिनाकपाणे-  
र्दनुजानां विजयाय विश्वकर्मा ॥ १३ ॥ 

‘Long ago,  
O King of Karṇāṭa,  
Viśvakarmā fashioned this sword  
with elements from each of the gods’ weapons,  
and presented it to Śiva  
to defeat the *dānavas*. 13 



अमुमुग्रतपःकृतप्रसादः  
प्रददौ पाण्ड्यनृपाय सोऽपि देवः ।  
यमुपेत्य चिरेण तस्य वंश्याः  
पृथिवीमप्रतिशासनामशासन् ॥ १४ ॥ 

‘Śiva in turn presented it to the Pāṇḍya king,  
pleased with the severity of his *tapas*.  
Once in possession of the sword,  
his descendants governed the land  
with none to gainsay their governance  
for many a year. 14 



अथ कालवशेन पाण्ड्यवंश्यान्  
गतवीर्यानवधार्य कुम्भजन्मा ।  
मनुजेश्वर मण्डलाग्रमेनं  
भवते प्रेषितवान् महाभुजाय ।। १५ ॥ 

‘Seeing the Pāṇḍyas’ power disappear over time,  
Agastya has now sent this sword to you,  
Your Most Mighty Majesty. 15 



अमुनाशु विशस्य दक्षिणस्यां  
मधुरायां पुरि कंसवन्नृशंसम् ।  
यवनाधिपतिं बलोत्तरस्त्वं  
विदधीथाः स्फुटमच्युतावतारम् ॥ १६ ॥ 

‘With this sword straightaway eliminate  
the Yavana potentate –  
cruel as Kaṃsa –  
in the Madhurā of the South,  
accompanied by your valour,  
as Kṛṣṇa was by Balarāma.  
Let the world know you  
as the incarnation of the god himself\!’2 16 


*Again the end of this canto, and the beginning and end of the final canto, are lost. *

Due to the loss of several verses in the manuscript, it is not clear who this female messenger is.

Kṛṣṇa killed his tyrant uncle Kaṃsa in another city called Madhurā \(now Mathura\) in northern India; Balarāma was his elder brother and constant companion.

**अन्तिमः सर्गः**

**FINAL CANTO**





मुक्ताफलैर्वीरकृपाणलेखा-  
विभिन्नगन्धद्विपकुम्भमुक्तैः ।  
रक्तारुणैस्तत्क्षणघट्टनोत्थ-  
स्फुलिङ्गसङ्घातमतिर्वितेने ।। १ ॥ उपजातिः 

The blood-stained pearls flooding forth  
as warriors sliced open rutting elephants’ temples  
with sharp swords  
seemed to be a shower of sparks  
as iron struck bone. 1 



निशाचराः केचन कुञ्जराणां  
कुम्भस्थलान्निःसृतमास्रपूरम् ।  
निष्ठ्यूतमुक्तामणयः सहर्षं  
चुचूषुरुत्पुष्करनालदण्डैः ॥ २ ॥ 

    

A rabble of night-roaming *rākṣasas*,  
inverting elephant trunks to make straws,  
slurped with satisfied burps  
the blood streaming from the beasts’ temples,  
spitting out the pearls. 2 



जिघत्सयान्तः पतगैः प्रविष्टैः  
प्रस्पन्दमानं कुणपं द्विपस्य ।  
समीपमासाद्य सजीवबुद्ध्या  
व्यसुं सतृष्णोऽपि जहौ सृगालः ॥ ३ ॥ 

A jackal came up to the corpse of an elephant,  
but bolted,  
though it was dead and he was ravenous –  
for the birds that had entered it searching for spoils  
were setting it ashudder  
as if with new life. 3 



द्विषा सरोषेण पृषत्कवर्षै-  
र्निषूदितः कोऽप्यमरत्वमेत्य ।  
चकार तस्योपरि पुष्पवर्षं  
सहर्षमुद्घोषितचाटुवादः ॥ ४ ॥ 

One man –  
slain by an enemy soldier  
showering arrows upon him in seething anger –  
now become immortal,  
showered flowers upon his assassin  
singing his praises ecstatically. 4 



कुम्भेषु भिन्दन् नृपतिर्द्विपेन्द्रान्   
मुक्ताफलैः शर्करिलान्तराभिः ।  
प्रावर्तयद्रक्ततरङ्गिणीभिः  
परःशताः संयति ताम्रपर्णीः ॥ ५ ॥ 

The King,  
tearing apart the temples of the mightiest of elephants,  
made hundreds of Tāmraparṇī rivers flow  
all over the battlefield  
as streams of blood gushed forth  
pebbled with pearls. 5 



तेन द्विपास्तोमरिणा विभिन्नाः  
कुम्भस्थलैरुज्झितमौक्तिकौघैः ।  
क्रौञ्चस्य जह्रुर्गुहशक्तिघात-  
प्रकीर्णहंसप्रकरस्य शोभाम् ॥ ६ ॥ 

As his javelin rent each elephant’s temples,  
letting loose a flood of pearls,  
the beasts came to resemble Mount Krauñca  
when Kumāra’s spear pierced it clean through  
setting forth a stream of *haṃsas*.1 6 



शूरस्तथा प्राहृत मुद्गरेण  
शिरस्त्रवन्ति द्विषतां शिरांसि ।  
यथा विनिर्यन्नयनानि तानि  
मङ्क्षु न्यमाङ्क्षुः स्वशरीर एव ॥ ७ ॥ 

    

With such force did the warrior  
hurl his hammer upon the helmets of his foes  
that their heads,  
eyes bulging out,  
sunk with a plunk into their necks. 7 



ततस्तुलुष्कान् युधि कान्दिशीका-  
नालोक्य विष्फारितघोरशार्ङ्गः ।  
कम्पक्षितीन्द्रं यवनाधिराजः  
प्रत्यग्रहीद्वृत्र इवामरेन्द्रम् ॥ ८ ॥ 

At that moment,  
seeing his men running helter-skelter across the battlefield,  
the Yavana king,  
twanging his fearsome bow,  
attacked King Kampa  
as Vṛtra did Indra, king of the gods. 8 



आस्फाल्यमानस्य च तेन गाढं  
शार्ङ्गस्य मौर्वीनिनदश्चकार ।  
चिरात् परित्यज्य तमुच्चलन्त्या  
जयश्रियो नूपुरघोषशङ्काम् ॥ ९ ॥ 

The sound from the Sultan’s bowstring  
as he twanged it forcefully  
seemed to be the sudden trill of anklets  
as his goddess of victory  
after so many years  
started from his side,  
abandoning him. 9 



बाणा निरस्ता यवनेन तस्मि-  
न्नपाङ्गपाता इव वीरलक्ष्म्याः ।  
कम्पेश्वरेणाप्यभिपारसीकं  
शराः कटाक्षा इव कालरात्रेः ॥ १० ॥ 

The Yavana lord’s arrows accosted the King  
like the come-hither glances of Victory herself;  
but those fired by Kampa assailed the Persian  
like the menacing leer of dusky Death. 10 



स केरलप्राणमरुद्भुजङ्गान्  
वन्यावनीन्द्रद्रुमदाववह्नीन् ।  
अन्ध्रान्धकारक्षयतिग्मभासो  
बाणानमुञ्चद्यवने नरेन्द्रः ।। ११ ॥ 

Arrows that had served as  
snakes to the vital air of the Kerala king,  
wildfires to the flourishing tree  
that was the forest chief, Campa,  
suns destroying the grand dragoons of darkness,  
the Andhras –  
such arrows did the King let loose upon the Sultan. 11 



क्षतानि यान्यस्य शरैः शरीरे  
चकार वीरस्य तुलुष्कवीरः ।  
वितेनिरे तानि नखाङ्कशङ्कां  
जयश्रियो भोगसमुत्सुकायाः ॥ १२ ॥ 

The wounds wrought  
by the Tuluṣka warrior’s arrows  
upon that warrior’s limbs  
made it seem as though  
the goddess of victory  
ardently awaiting their lovemaking  
had pricked him with her sharp-tipped nails. 12 



उदग्रमग्रे यवनाधिभर्तुः  
साक्षात् कलेर्मौलिमिवाशुगेन ।  
स मङ्क्षु सार्धं जयकाङ्क्षितेन  
ध्वाङ्क्षध्वजं ध्वंसयति स्म धन्वी ॥ १३ ॥ 

    

In a split second  
with a single shaft  
did the bowman break the crow-blazoned banner  
flying high before the Yavana emperor  
as though it were the very head of Kali –  
and with it all his hopes of victory. 13 



अमर्षितस्याथ पृषत्कवर्षं  
विमुञ्चतो विद्विषतः शरेण ।  
स कार्मुकज्यामलुनात् तुलुष्क-  
राज्यश्रियो मङ्गलसूत्रकल्पाम् ॥ १४ ॥ 

As his rival rained arrows upon him  
in feverish fury,  
the King severed with his own arrow  
the Turk’s bow string,  
as though it were the sacred marital chord  
worn by the goddess of his reign.2 14 



विहाय शार्ङ्गं धनुरिद्धरोष-  
स्तुलुष्कवीरस्तरवारिमुग्रम् ।  
तुरङ्गपर्याणनिबद्धवर्ध्रा-  
विलम्बिनं सत्वरमुज्जहार ॥ १५ ॥ 

The stouthearted Sultan,  
incandescent with ire,  
flung aside his horn-carved bow  
and at once seized a fearsome sword  
hanging by a strap from his saddle. 15 



अथाग्रहीत् कम्पनृपस्तमेव  
कौक्षेयकं कालकरालरूपम् ।  
व्यापादनार्थं यवनेश्वरस्य  
यः प्रेषितः प्राक् कलशोद्भवेन ॥ १६ ॥ 

King Kampa in turn took hold of that sword  
sent to him afore by Agastya  
to vanquish the Yavana king,  
a blade dreadful as the dark lord of death. 16 



स वञ्चयंस्तत्तरवारिधारां  
धाराविशेषप्रवणोपवाह्यः ।  
अशातयत् तस्य शिरो निमेषा-  
दनेन कर्णाटकुलप्रदीपः ॥ १७ ॥ 

The light of the Karṇāṭas, Kampa,  
riding his horse at a great gallop,  
lopped off the Sultan’s head with his sword,  
dodging his foe’s whetted blade. 17 



अज्ञातसेवोचितचाटुवादं  
तुलुष्कसाम्राज्यकृताभिषेकम् ।  
दिवौकसामप्यकृतप्रणामं  
भूमौ सुरत्राणशिरः पपात ॥ १८ ॥ 

Never had the Sultan's head sunk to sycophancy.  
Gracing the imperial crown of the Tuluṣka Empire,  
not once had it bowed, even before the gods.  
Down  
to the ground  
it fell. 18 



च्युतेऽपि शीर्षे चलिताश्ववल्गा-  
नियन्त्रणव्यापृतवामपाणिम् ।  
प्रतिप्रहारप्रसृतान्यहस्तं  
वीरः कबन्धं द्विषतोऽभ्यनन्दीत् ॥ १९ ॥ 

The courageous king cheered his rival:  
though the corpse’s head was rolling in the dust,  
the left hand continued to restrain his speeding steed,  
while the right stretched forth to settle the score. 19 



प्रशान्तदावेव वनान्तलक्ष्मी-  
र्गतोपरागा गगनस्थलीव ।  
कलिन्दजा मर्दितकालियेव  
दिग्दक्षिणासीत् क्षतपारसीका ॥ २० ॥ 

Like a beautiful grove after a wildfire has finally tired,  
like the expanse of the sky when an eclipse has passed,  
like Yamunā, Kalinda’s daughter, once Kāliya was killed3 –  
thus shone the South now that the Persian lay slain. 20 


The god Kumāra blasted a hole through this Himalayan mountain, thus creating a shortcut for *haṃsas* flying to Mount Kailāsa.

A woman’s marital chord \(the mangalsutra\) is strongly linked to her husband’s life.

Kṛṣṇa killed the serpent Kāliya which lived in the Yamunā river.
