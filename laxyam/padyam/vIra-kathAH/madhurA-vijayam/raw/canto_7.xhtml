</p>
<p class="enpoem">
At that point the sun,  
as if filled with terror  
at the crime he had committed  
in trying to make lotuses as radiant  
as the lotus-faces of the King’s wives,  
scurried to a cave  
buried deep in the setting mountain.

</p>

<p class="enpoem">
Sucked clean of energy by lotuses,  
swiftly sank the sun into the western sea,  
chariot reverberating as he raced downwards,  
seemingly to replenish his heat from the fire in the deep.[^1]

</p>
<p class="enpoem">
The full cheeks of Varuṇa’s wives,  
reddened by the rays of the setting sun,  
took on the rosy flush of wine  
though they had not  
touched a drop.[^2]

</p>
<p class="enpoem">
The scorching torment the sun suffered  
in parting from his first lover, the East,  
vanished in the arms of the next, the West.  
Who can fathom the hearts of those red-hot with passion?

</p>
<p class="enpoem">
The sun’s reflection,  
repeated over and over  
upon the wave-scored surface of the wind-stirred sea,  
looked like a ruby staircase  
readied for him to descend from the heavens.

<p class="enpoem">
As the sun plunged into the ocean,  
the few sunbeams still suspended in the sky  
seemed to be the strewn branches  
torn from the tree of day  
by the tusker of Time.

As the ray-rich sun’s radiance-robbed disc  
wobbled from wave to wave,  
fish fancied it a piece of meat,  
licking at it with flicking tongues.

</p>
<p class="enpoem">
Whistling all the while,  
the bee,  
like a sentry on night-watch,  
patrolled the lotus flower –  
the tower which was Lakṣmī’s bower[^3]–  
as each petal-door was pulled to.

<p class="enpoem">
The day herself  
seemed to place upon the lotus bud –  
a casket in which she was anxious  
to keep both nectar and scent safe –  
a lac-dark seal in the bee clinging to its edge.

To those on earth  
the glow of the evening sky

In the sky shone the clouds,

Then arose a sliver of darkness –

In a moment,  
solid darkness shrouded people’s sight –  
a darkened mass of blackened soot

<p class="enpoem">
People deemed the dense darkness,  
dotted with a legion of slender stars,

The sky was a tree:  
the new shoots were the red streaks of the dying day,  
the thick foliage they grew into was the darkness,  
and at length the tree’s branches,  
the directions,  
began to burst into an unceasing series of flower-stars.

After that  
there shone in the East,

The Eastern zone,
