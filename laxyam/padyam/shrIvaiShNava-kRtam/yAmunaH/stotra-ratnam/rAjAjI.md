Sri Yamunacharya's A Rendering in English with Notes by DR MS RAJAJEE  

With a Foreword by DR M.NARASIMHACHARYA  
Professor of Vaishnavism, Madras University 
Published by Sri P. Krishnaiah, I.A.S., Executive Officer, Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, Tirupati-517 507.

## PUBLISHER'S NOTE 
Among the great Vaishnava acharyas, Sri Yamunacharya, also known as Alavandar, occupies a unique place. He has made substantial contributions to Visishtadvaita philosophy and established the pre-eminence of Sriman Narayana through his philosophical works and hymns. Sri Yamuna's "Stotraratna" occupies a special place in the devotional literature as it clothes philosophical ideas in poetic language.

The 'Strotra ratna' consisting of 65 verses conveys the basic ideas of Visishtadvaita philosophy like the relations of the individual self to the supreme and His Consort, the place of the triple path of karma, jnana and bhakti and the means for His Divine Grace. Above all, it emphasises the supreme significance of Prapatti or surrender to achieve salvation. Considered as a rare jewel among hymns, the 'Stotra ratna' calls upon us to surrender at the Lotus Feet of Lord Narayana.

The present translation of this well-known stotra by Dr. MS. Rajajee is refreshingly simple and lucid. The author, an able administrator and an ardent devotee of Lord Srinivasa, has admirably captured the original spirit of the verses. The translation along with an exhaustive commentary brings out the enduring charm of the 'Stotraratna' in a masterly style.

We take great delight in presenting this book to the theistic public and hope, in all humility, that they would derive immense spiritual benefit by reading this book.

P. Krishnaiah Executive Officer, TTD 

## FOREWORD 
I have immense pleasure in writing this Foreword to the English rendering of Sri Yamunacharya's Stotraratna done by Dr M.S.Rajajee, I.A.S., who held many high administrative positions such as the Chief Secretaryship to the Government of Andhra Pradesh and the Chairmanship of the Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission. Dr Rajajee is a man of many parts and his passion for philosophy and religion is at once amazing and abysmal. Born in a Srivaishnava family of great piety and nobility, he, notwithstanding the onerous responsibilities of his high office, has been finding time to study the cardinal works of this tradition and expound the truths contained therein in simple but effective English so that the layman who has no access to the original works in Sanskrit can catch their spirit and relive the glorious past in which the authors lived and wrote.

I have had the opportunity of going through his English annotation of the Mukundamala of Saint Kulasekhara, which, by all means, is the best-written one. The speciality of Dr Rajajee's style is its astounding simplicity marked by smoothness of flow and aptness of expression. Even the profoundest idea can be put across by him with commendable ease and dignity. This, in my opinion, is a rare quality to be found in translators. I have also seen a recent publication of the Satsampradaya Parirakshana Sabha, Warangal, which is an English translation by Dr Rajajee for the Satsampradaya Sudha written by one of our most erudite and prolific Srivaishnava Acharyas, Mahamahopadhyaya, Kavi-Sabdika Kesari, Sri U.Ve. S.N.C.Raghunathacharya Swami. Here again we find the translation very easy and telling, bringing out the spirit of the original in its best possible way.

The Stotraratna occupies a very high place in the hymnal literature of the Srivaishnavas of South India since it is the first hymn to have come from the pen of a great pre-Ramanuja writer who happened to be the grand-teacher of the great Ramanuja and the grandson of Nathamuni, the first Srivaishnava teacher whose works, the Nyayatattva and the Yogarahasya have not come down to us. The Stotraratna, along with the Sristuti or the Catussloki of the same Acharya are very significant in the Srivaishnava tradition. Clothing the philosophical ideas of the School in a poetic garb, they have inspired many later Srivaishnava writers to compose more detailed treatises, hymns and works highlighting the basic tenets of the School such as the Supremacy of Lord Vishnu, the glory of His highest abode called Srivaikuntha, the position of his consort Sri or Lakshmi and the efficacy of the paths of Bhakti and Prapatti in effecting salvation. Inspired by these hymns of Yamuna only Sri Ramanuja composed his Gadyatraya.

The present work viz., the Stotraratna has been quite popular with authors of texts on the Alankarasastra also. For instance, Sri Appaya Dikshita in his Kuvalayananda cites the verse "tavaamrita-syandini paada-pankaje..." (no.27) as an illustration for the figure of speech "Prativastupama" and the verse "abhutapurvam mama bhaavi." (No.25) as an example for the figure of speech called "Sambhava".

I am immensely happy to note that Dr Rajajee has done a commendable work on this important ancient Stotra of the Srivaishnava Literature. The popularity of this hymn is such that it is recited every day in every home of the orthodox Srivaishnavas. I take this opportunity to thank Dr Rajajee for giving me the opportunity of writing this Foreword to his translation, and to request him to carry on his literary activities. A gifted writer as he is, the benefit of his scholarship should reach the common masses who are well acquainted with English language but are not well-rooted in Sanskrit. I understand that he is currently making an in-depth study of the Ramayana written by poetess Molla in Telugu, with a view to present the beauties of that composition to the common people through the medium of English. I also understand that he is making a study of the Narasimha Kshetras and preparing an authoritative and exhaustive monograph on this very interesting subject. I wish him well in his enterprises and do earnestly hope that all his works will come in print so that the scholars and laymen alike can be benefited by his wisdom and scholarship.

## PREFACE 
Recently, I had undertaken a study of Kulasekhara Azhvar's "Mukunda Mala". I had completed the translation, with notes, in English. The TTD had published my work. I had seperately translated some scholarly lectures of Mahamahopadhyay Sri Raghunathacharya Svami varu of Warangal. These were published by the Veda Parirakshana Sabha of Warangal. I was therefore drawn to Vaishnavaite literature and took up a study of the Stotra Ratna, by Sri Yamunacharya. Sri Yamunacharya, as readers know, is pre Bhagavan Ramanuja and had laid the foundation for Visishtadvaita, though, it was not known by that name, at that time. I looked around for English translations, of this scholarly work. I found only two-one is an excellent translation, into English, without any comments, by Svami Adidevananda, of the Ramakrishna Mutt. The other one, an equally good translation, with brief notes, was by Sri S. Satyamurthi, of Gwalior, who has rendered great service to the readers by his many translation works and comments. The translation of Sri Satyamurthi, is based on the scholarly work in Tamil, by Sri Anangarachariar. The most outstanding work is, however that of Prof. Narasimhacharya, presently Head of the Dept. of Vaishnavism, of the Madras University. His is a scholarly dissertation on the "Contribution of Sri Yamunacharya to Visistadvaita". He presents Yamunacharya, on a much larger canvas. I felt that there was a need for a book, for people like me, who are not scholars, but would like to have a translation of this great work and would like to have detailed notes, about what others have said on the embedded thoughts. Hence, the present work.

I do not claim any scholarship to warrant my venturing to write such a book. That I should have attempted to do so can only be attributed to the great mysteries of life and to the divine will. On a particular day, I felt that I would like to write such a book and started this work, trusting the Divine Feet of the Lord. His unseen hand enabled me to complete this work. If it is was the unseen hand of the Lord that helped me to write the book, it is the seen hand of Prof. Narasimhacharya, which encouraged me at different stages. Prof. Narasimhacharya is very well known and needs no intruduction. He is heading the Department of Vaishnavism, Madras University and is widely known in Vaishnavaite, Sanskrit and Telugu literary circles. He has won many accolades for his contributions and has received many national awards. He combines in himself erudition, outstanding scholarship, a thorough understanding of the subject, an unmatched meticulousness and a rare humility. It was he who went through my manuscript and advised me to publish it, when I had doubts about the merit of my work. This does not mean that my work had any great merit; it shows that he has that unsual quality of encouraging fledgeling writers. I deem it as a rare honour conferred on me that he went through the manuscript and agreed to write an Intruduction.

I have kept Sri Anangarachari's commentary, in Telugu, as the basis for my work. I have amplified the comments, by quoting from the Srimad Bhagavatam, the Ramayana, the Narayaneeyam, the Stotras of Sri Vedanta Desika and my earlier translation with notes on Mukundamala. I gratefully acknowledge the quotations from the scholarly translation of Desika Stotras by Sri Raghavan, Dr Lakshmi Kumari and Prof Narasimhacharya. I am grateful to Prof Venkatakrishnan, Professor of Vaishnavism, Madras University, for having spared me a photo of an idol of Sri Yamunacharya in a temple, which adorns the cover page of this book.

I owe a great debt of gratitude to Sri Koteesvara Rao, working in the "Peshi" of the Chief Secretary's Office at Hyderabad. He did the typing work, willingly, with his usual efficiency and above all, most cheerfully. He did it during his spare hours, which really meant late, late hours of the night. I am deeply touched by the manner in which he did this work, as a labour of love. I am thankful to my family members, who encouraged me at different stages of the work.

I am very thankful to Dr I.V. Subba Rao, I.A.S., former EO of the TTD and the members of the Publication Committee, for having agreed to publish this work. I am deeply touched by the warm sentiments expressed by Sri Subba Rao, while accepting the book for publication. I am also grateful to the present EO, Sri P. Krishnaiah, IAS., who expedited this publication. I am thankful to Dr Ramamurthi, Editor, Saptagiri and his team of officers for the very efficient manner in which they took up and completed this work.

I place this work at the Feet of the Lord and seek His Divine Grace.

RajajeeIntroduction The is a work of 65 slokas, written by Sri Yamuna Acharya, also known as Alavandar. It is rated very highly in Vaishanavite literature and hence this Alavandar Stotra is known only as - a jewel among the stotras. It is a priceless jewel in the devotional literature and expounds the tenets of Vaishnavism. The later pillars of Vaishnavism, Ramanuja, Parasara Bhatta, Vedanta Desika and others derived their inspiration from this work. It is said that a recital of these slokas by Mahapurna, used to always cast an irresistible spell on Ramanuja. Sloka 11 in the used to cast a magic spell on Ramanuja. It is this same sloka which weaned away Ramanuja's cousin Govinda (known as Embar) from Saivism. In turn, Yamuna derived inspiration for his work from the Divya Prabandham and many slokas put across in mellifluous Sanskrit, are what had been stated in the Divya Prabhandham.

Sri Yamuna was born in 953 AD in Viranarayanapuram of Tamilnadu (not far from Cuddalore). He was the son of Ishwara Muni and the grandson of Sri Ranganatha Muni (known popularly as Nathamuni). It is said that Nathamuni and his family members were going on a pilgrimage in North India. As the conception took place on the banks of the river Yamuna, Sri Nathamuni gave the child the name Yamuna. Sri Ishwara Muni died at a young age. On the death of his son, Nathamuni renounced the world and became a recluse. The education of young Yamuna was left to Bhasya Bhattaraka.+++(5)+++ Yamuna was an excellent student and shone in all branches of studies.

Yamuna's teacher and all the others were under the rulership of a Pandyan king. The chief preceptor and religious disputant in the court was Vidvajjanakolahala. As his very name indicated, he threw all the learned people into turmoil, as he used to mercilessly vanquish them in scholarly debates. Yamuna's teacher was one among those who had been defeated. He was therefore required ...

I am enveloped in Rajas and Tamas. I am incapable, but I pretend to be capable and have composed this text of feigned praise. Atleast making this as the reason, please save me. O Dharanidhara (sustainer of the universe), make my mind to give up other thoughts and discipline it, so as to think of You alone.

Alavandar says that he is surrounded by passion and inertia. He is guilty of singing praises, which are not coming from the heart. He uses the words "false praise" (chadma stuti). He wants them to be taken at their face value (that is make it the base or authority, "avalambya api") and the redemptive grace of the Lord extended to him, so that his mind is disciplined ("me manah sikshaya").

Two points are spelt out in this sloka. One is that if the Lord is worshipped by non-sattvic people, their sins also will be washed away by the grace of the Lord. The second point that is made is that if the name of the Lord is repeated, even casually or facetiously, the sins would get obliterated. The second of the above two points is clearly borne out by the story of Ajamila, given in the Srimad Bhagavatam. The Bhagavatam tells us that the efficacy of the Name, which a man obtains by abstract meditation in the Krita Age, by sacrifice in the Treta Age, by adoration in the Dvapara Age, he obtains in the Kali Age by reciting the names of Narayana. Slokas 23 and 24 of Mukunda Mala need to be recalled in this context. Says Kulasekhara: 84 Sri Yamunacharya's "The holy formula of Sri Krishna is an unparalleled mantra to cut off everything hostile to one's good. It is the sum total of the mantras consisting of the sacred Upanishadic statements. It is the mantra which rescues one from "samsara". It is the mantra that expels the mass of accumulated darkness. It is the only mantra for the attainment of complete Lordship. It is the mantra that completely delivers those who are bitten by the snake of addiction to passions. O my tongue, always chant this Mantra, so that you may attain the fruition of your life". (Sloka 23) "The medicine in the form of the divine name of Sri Krishna cures ignorance and discrimination. It inspires sages to engage their minds in meditation and it torments the demons. It is the medicine for restoring the three worlds to life and for bestowing unlimited blessings on the devotees of the Supreme Lord. Indeed, it is the only medicine that can destroy one's fear of material existence and lead one to the attainment of supreme good". (Sloka 24) Alavandar prays for the mind being penalized ("shikshaya") or disciplined. What is this disciplining which is spoken of here? Having said that the utterings have not come from the heart, the obvious prayer is that there should be no duplicity in the supplication. The related offshoot is that the mind should be disciplined so that the thoughts are centred only on the Lord.

The Lord is addressed as "Dharanidhara". He is the Sustainer of the Earth. He absorbs all the sins and absolves the true seeker. One should recall the episode in the Srimad Bhagavatam. Mother Earth complains to the Lord that she is unable to bear the weight of the sinners, as they have increased greatly in numbers. The Lord assures her that He will manifest Himself to rid the earth of the sinners. The Lord bears all this weight. One should also recall the Varaha Avatara. The Lord playfully held up the earth, as if it was a ball to be played with by Him.

पिता त्वं माता त्वं दयिततनयस्त्वं प्रियसुहृत् verder zai fazi yoefer nfagenfer smarg | त्वदीयस्त्वद् भृत्यस्तव परजिनस्त्वद्गतिरहं प्रपन्नश्चैवं सत्यहमपि तवैवास्मि हि भरः ॥ ६० ॥

For all the worlds, You alone are the father, mother, the beloved son, the dear friend, the confidant, the preceptor and the sole refuge. I am Yours, Your servant, Your attendant and Your protectee who has sought Your refuge. The responsibility for my welfare rests solely on You.

In the previous sloka, Alavandar had said that he had composed the text which was "chadma stuti", that is, it had not come from the heart. That being the case, the Lord may well ask why he should take to heart the pleadings of Alavandar which had not come from his heart. Alavandar replies in this sloka that the relationship between the two of them cannot be pushed aside. The Lord is the father, the mother, the son, the friend, the confidant and the sole refuge. He (the hymnologist) is the servant, the attendant and the "prapanna" who has sought the Lord as the sole refuge. Hence the Lord has to save him ("bharah asmi hi".) In this connection, one may recall sloka (5). While paying obeisance to the effulgent feet of Nammalwar, Alavandar had said that the feet constitute to all Vaishnavites at all times "..the aggregate of all worldly relations, such as mother, father, wife, sons, daughters and wealth in general".

In the sloka, two words are used which apparently look similar - "priya suhrut" and "mitram". We have translated them as confidant and a friend. There is a subtle difference between the two. A friend is one where the relationship is on a reciprocal basis while a confidant is one in whom we confide, a person who works for and helps one, without expecting any thing in return.

जनित्वाहं वंशे महति जगति ख्यातयशसां शुचीनां युक्तानां गुणपुरुषतत्त्वस्थितिविदाम् । निसर्गादेव त्वच्चरणकमलैकान्तमनसाम् अधोऽधः पापात्मा शरणद निमज्जामि तमसि ॥ ६१ ॥

306 86 Sri Yamunacharya's Janitvaaham vamse mahati jagati khyaata yasasaam sucheenaam yukṭaanaam guna-purusha tattva sthithividaam nisargaad eva tvat-charana-kamalaikaanta manasaam adho adhah paapaatmaa saranada! nimajjaami tamasi.

O refuge of all, though born in the exalted lineage of those of world renown, who are pure and ever abiding of You, who know the real nature of matter and spirit, who by their very nature have their minds solely devoted to Your lotus feet, I, being evil minded, am sinking deeper and deeper into the darkness of ignorance.

Thinking that the Lord may say that Alavandar is born in a good family, with a good lineage and that this is itself sufficient to attain the Lord, why then does he have to depend on the Lord? Alavandar replies that though he has an excellent lineage, he is a sinner. The poet describes the lineage - those of world renown ("jagati khyata"), those who are pure ("suchinam"), those who cannot bear to be separated from the Lord ("yuktanam"), those who know the qualities of matter and spirit ("guna purusha tattvasthiti vidam") and those who naturally have their minds devoted to the lotus feet of the Lord ("tvat charana kamala ekanta manasaam"). But then, he is a sinner. He is sinking into the darkness of ignorance. Since he is sinking deeper and deeper, into the abyss of 'tamas' called ignorance, the Lord, by His mercy has to redeem him.

Three descriptive phrases have been used to describe the worth of the lineage - those who are unable to bear separation from the Lord, those who know the difference between matter and spirit, and those who are devoted to the feet of the Lord. Alavandar thereby is referring to the Karma, Jnana and Bhakti Yoga knowledge of his ancestors.

This prayer of Alavandar to save him from sinking into the abyss of ignorance (samsara) is similar to sloka (34) in Mukunda Mala. Says Kulasekhara: "O Supreme Lord, Bhagavan, You are the most compassionate. So, please show me Your favour and bestow Your mercy upon 87 this helpless soul. You alone can lift me from the ocean of samsara into which I am sinking. O Lord Hari, You are verily the Purushottama, the Supreme Person! (Sloka 34) अमर्यादः क्षुद्रश्चलमतिरसूयाप्रसवभूः कृतघ्नो दुर्गानी स्मरपरवशो वञ्चनपरः । नृशंसः पापिष्ठः कथमहमितो दुःखजलधेः Gruırıgnhukma aftatai arurat: 11 &2 11 Amaryaadah kshudrah chalamatir asooyaaprasavabhooh kritaghno durmaani smaraparavaso vanchanaparah Nrisamsah paapisthah katham aham ito duhkhajaladheh Apaaraad utteernas tava parichareyam charanayoh.

I have been a transgressor (of the Sastras), an evil person, fickle minded, the home for envy, lascivious, deceitful, cruel and most wicked. How may I, crossing the boundless sea of misery, serve Your lotus feet? In the previous sloka, the word "paapaatma" had been used. Alavandar now elaborates all the bad qualities he is guilty of having in himself. He is a 1) heretic having no respect for scriptural injunctions (amaryadah) 2) an evil person ("kshudrah"), 3) a person with an unstable mind ("chalamatih"), meaning one who does not think of sastras, 4) the home for jealousy ("asuya prasavabhuh"), 5) one who forgets the good done to him, one who is ungrateful ("kritaghnah"), 6) one who is arrogant (durmaani), 7) one who is a slave to cupid ("smara paravasah"), 8) a deceitful person ("vanchanaparah"), 9) a cruel person (nrisamsah) 10) a wicked person ("papishthah"). He wants to know how he should get ashore from this unfathomable and boundless ocean of miseries and serve the Lord's feet? One must record here that once Sri Parasara Bhattar recited this sloka in the shrine of Ranganatha at Srirangam and said that he was in the same position as the hymnographer. There was a Vaishnava, a contemporary of Parasara Bhattar, who was jealous of the growing popularity of Bhattar and his own declining popular88 Sri Yamunacharya's ity. He was present in the shrine at the same time. Out of jealousy he burst out that Bhattar was not only guilty of the above sins, but that he was guilty of several more. All present there were shocked. Parasara Bhattar completed his worship and presented his gold ring to the jealous Vaishnava after covering him with a shawl. The Vaishnava was ashamed and nonplussed. Bhattar said that he was grateful to the Vaishnava for opening his (Bhattar's) eyes to the several sins about which he was not aware of himself. So great was the humility of Bhattar. It was this sloka which Bhattar had recited. Actually, Alavandar is not even remotely guilty of the above deficiencies. This sloka is intended for a majority of us and we are expected to recite it, with humility, before the Lord and purge ourselves of our sins.

Self-deprecation while worshipping the Lord is a common device used by the great Vaishnavite hymnographers. We had, in this work, quoted several such slokas from the works of Sri Vedanta Desika. We will quote two more. Says Desika in Saranagati Dipika: "Though I am more sinful than a hundred Ravanas put together, I have understood the declarations made by You on the seashore and on Arjuna's chariot, that You would offer refuge to all beings. So I realize that You have offered protection to me, for Your own sake."(Sloka 53).

"After making me say these unique and unvolitional words "I am yours, I have to be protected by you", You should not, like others, stand helplessly before Your queens, with Your virtues, overcome by my sins...."(Sloka 54).

रघुवर यदभूस्त्वं तादृशो वायसस्य प्रणत इति दयालुर्यच्च चैद्यस्य कृष्णा ।

प्रतिभवमपराद्भुर्मुग्ध सायुज्यदोऽभूः 'वद किमपदमागस्तस्य तेऽस्ति क्षमायाः ॥ ६३ ॥

Raghuvara yad abhoostvam taadriso vaayasasya pranata iti dayaalur yacha chaidyasya krishna! Pratibhavam aparaaddhur mugdha! saayujyado abhooh Vada kim apadamaa-agas tasya te asti ksmaayaah.

69 89 O Lord, as Raghuvara, you were compassionate to Kakasura, merely because he had sought You, though he had committed a transgression which could not be tolerated. As Sri Krishna, you had pardoned Sisupala, and granted him the Supreme bliss of attaining You, despite his having wronged You, birth after birth. So then, tell me, whether there is any crime, which is excluded from the scope of Your clemency? In the previous sloka Alavandar had said that he is the worst sinner. Lest the Lord ask him as to how he, a transgressor hopes to be redeemed, Alavandar reminds the Lord of the episode of Kakasura and of the episode of Sisupala, to remind the Lord that transgressors have all been redeemed by the Lord. He asks the Lord what transgression is there that the Lord will not forgive ("kshamayah apdam agah kim asti")? The story of Kakasura, the crow, is well known. It appears in the Sundara Kanda of the Ramayana. Hanuman has seen and conversed with Sita. He asks for a token so that he would be able to convince Rama that it was indeed Sita he had seen. Sita gives a jewel as a token of remembrance and additionally recounts the story relating to the pardon of Kakasura, which incident is known only to Rama and Sita. Sita was resting on the lap of Rama, when a crow made a bold attack on her. Rama woke up and angry as a five headed cobra saw the bloodstained talons of the crow. He released the Brahma astra against the crow. The crow circumambulated the world, but the arrow pursued it. None could save the crow. On the advice of Brahma, the crow sought the ref uge of Lord Ramachandra and sought forgiveness. The Lord, in His compassion granted life to the crow, but took away its eye, as the Brahmastra cannot be rendered ineffective. Hence, even the transgressor who had directly transgressed and committed an 'apachara' against the Lord, when he approaches Him and seeks His grace, the Lord will grant the grace.

The episode of Sisupala is well known. It is chronicled in the Srimad Bhagavatham. Jaya and Vijaya, the attendants of the 90 Sri Yamunacharya's Lord, at Vaikuntha, had prevented the Kumaras from having an audience with Lord Vishnu. The sages cursed them that they should eternally be asuras, after being born in the world. On the intervention of the Lord, the curse was modified. They were to be born as asuras, but thrice and in all the births they were to meet their death at the hands of the Lord. Though they were in constant conflict with the Lord, in each birth, their thoughts were always centred on the Lord. In succession they were born as Hiranyakasipu and Hiranyaksha, Ravana and Kumbhakarna, Sisupala and Dantavaktra. In all the cases, they were killed by the Lord. The manner of death of Sisupala was as follows. In a Rajasuya Yaga conducted by Yudhishthira, all the kings including Krishna, from Dwaraka, had been invited. A question arose, as to whom 'agrapuja' was to be done. Sahadeva suggested that it should be done to Krishna, who had stood by the Pandavas and was a respected elder statesman. Sisupala opposed this and made contemptuous remarks against Krishna, both because of past enmity and because of jealousy. When, in addition to the abusive speech, Sisupala sought to attack Krishna, the Lord beheaded Sisupala with his disc. Says the Bhagavatham (Skanda X Chapter 74) "while all the world looked on, a centre of brilliance, coming out of the dead body of Sisupala, was found to reach Krishna and get absorbed in him, like a meteor falling on the earth. Continously communing in confrontation with the Lord as his enemy, during three births, he attained to his being. For, continuous contemplation turns one into the nature of one contemplated upon....." It is to these two episodes that Alavandar makes a reference and states that there is no transgression that the Lord will not forgive - one has to turn to Him with concentration. He then becomes the refuge.

ननु प्रपन्नः सकृदेव नाथ तवाहमस्मीति च याचमानः ।

तवानुकम्प्यः स्मरतः प्रतिज्ञां मदेकवर्जं किमिदं व्रतं ते ॥ ६४ ॥

Nanu prasannah sakrudeva naatha! Tavaahamasmeeti cha yaachamaanah Tavaanukampyah smaratah pratijnaam Madekavarjam kimidam vratam te.

91 16 I have sought Your refuge. You had promised that if one surrenders but once to You, You will protect that person. I have also done so. Does your promise exclude me? Since Alavandar had, in the previous sloka, made specific reference to the episodes of Kakasura and Sisupala, the Lord may state that the grace of redemption is only extended on individual - specific basis and is certainly not applicable on a general basis. Alavandar therefore states in this sloka that he is a "prapanna", and he had sought the refuge of the Lord. He reminds the Lord that he has made a vow ("pratijnam") that if a person surrenders but once ("sakrudeva") to the Lord, He would protect the person. Alavandar says that he has also sought the grace. Does the vow ("vratam") of the Lord exclude him alone ("mad ekavarjam kim")? One should recall here the episode of Vibheeshana in the Ramayana. After Hanuman leaves Lanka in a shambles, setting fire to half the city, Ravana calls for a meeting of his counsellors. Vibheeshana gives wholesome advice. He asks Ravana to sue for peace and return Vaidehi. Ravana treats him with contempt. Vibheeshana with four of his followers goes to Lord Ramachandra and seeks his refuge. Angada, Sugriva and others suggest that Vibheeshana should be imprisoned and not given refuge. Rama quotes scriptures and citing Sage Kanva says "...In the name of humanity, one should not strike even an enemy who has arrived at one's door and is piteously soliciting protection with joined palms. Even an enemy who has come for protection should be protected, even at the cost of one's life. If from fear or folly or even from desire, a man does not justly protect a refugee according to his capacity, the sin incurred by him is despised in the world..." Lord Ramachandra gives refuge to Vibheeshana.

The hymnologist has this episode in mind and therefore says that if a person surrenders but once to the Lord, the Lord has 92 Sri Yamunacharya's extended His protection. The Lord may well say that this was individual-specific, that this was made applicable to Vibheeshana only and how does he expect it to be extended to him? Alavandar has in mind Lord Ramachandra's statement that even if Ravana were to seek his refuge, he would make it available. That is why Alavandar asks, am I alone excluded ("mat ekavarjam kim")? In this sloka, the words used are "...if one surrenders but once to you..." We do not wish to go into a religious discussion as to whether a 'prapanna' should do 'saranagati' only once or again and again. We will leave it to the Vaishnavite theologians to discuss this. We will, however, quote one sloka from 'Daya Satakam". Says Desika, "The Lord of Vrishachala does not abandon you even in anger, like the ocean which does not lose the quality of coolness, even after being heated. O Daya, You do not like Prapatti done a second time. Please touch me with the sporting lotuses, that is, the glances of the Lord". (Sloka 98).

We have quoted several slokas of Desika on the subject of 'Prapatti', 'Saranagati', during the course of this work. We will quote two more slokas from Saranagati Dipika. Says Desika: "O Lord, long ago you yourself truly said that compassion to those who seek refuge is the highest virtue. Because You are the one who gives refuge, You are now being reminded by me. Indeed, these undertakings of Yours are meant for people like me, is it not? (Sloka 45) "O Lord, Your forgiveness which was established as true in the case of Kakasura, Siva and others and which always devours the sins of those who try to say 'protect me' should not exclude me among beings" (Sloka 46) अकृत्रिमत्वच्चरणारविन्दप्रेमप्रकर्षावधिमात्मवन्तम् ।

पितामहं नाथमुनिं विलोक्य प्रसीद मद्वृत्तमचिन्तयित्वा ।। ६५ ।।

Akritrima tvachcharanaaravinda - prema-prakarshaavadhim aatmavantam93 pitaamaham Naathamunim vilokya praseeda madvrittam achintayitvaa.

Keeping in view the pure and guileless love of supreme devotion to your lotus feet by my grand father Nathamuni, the truly enlightened one, at least for his sake, please bless me, overlooking all my lapses and shortcomings.

In the first three slokas, obeisance had been offered to Nathamuni. In the last sloka, again a reference is being made. Alavandar says that the devotion displayed by Nathamuni is pure and gentle. It is abiding, unlike in the case of Alavandar. In sloka (62) Alavandar had submitted that he is fickle minded. His devotion may therefore not be constant and abiding. Alavandar pleads that atleast for the sake of Nathamuni, he has to be blessed without looking at his shortcomings. He says, without looking at his conduct (mad vrittam achintayitva), to please accept him ('praseeda').

This sloka underscores the fact that service to the feet of the Acharya is a sure pathway to liberation.

Conclusion: The Stotra Ratna, the hymn of 65 slokas, is a bench mark in Vaishnavite literature. It greatly influenced Bhagavan Ramanuja. This stotra brings out the essential teaching that the Lord is the means, the end and the goal of human endeavour. It also brings out the significance of the Dvayamantra. The sloka brings out clearly the efficacy of 'prapatti' in attaining liberation. The supremacy of Lord Vishnu is highlighted in many a verse, including indicating how the entire universe evolves out of him and is absorbed by him. The sovereignty of the Lord is impressed on us by highlighting His compassion, His beatific form and His eternally benevolent activities. This hymn is the centre piece of the concept of the Supreme Being and the concept of Surrender to him.

"Alavandar Thiruvadigale Saranam" T.T.D. Religious Publications Series No.593 Price: Rs. 15/"Stotra Ratna" of Sri Yamunacharya is a very rare jewel among devotional poems. This exquisite poem of 65 slokas contains the essence of the Visishatadvaita philosophy. Sri Yamunacharya, also known as Alavandar, elucidates the fundamental concepts regarding God and the soul and describes the qualities of the Lord and His unparalleled glory. Above all, this splendid stotra sets forth the concept of prapatti or wholehearted surrender to Lord Sriman Narayana most appealingly and authentically.

Dr. M.S.Rajajee who translated this magnum opus of Sri Yamunacharya was a distinguished officer of Indian Administrative Service. He has also excelled himself as an lerudite writer and author. ' Mukunda Mala translated by him was published by TTD.
