Sri Yamunacharya's A Rendering in English with Notes by DR MS RAJAJEE  

With a Foreword by DR M.NARASIMHACHARYA  
Professor of Vaishnavism, Madras University 
Published by Sri P. Krishnaiah, I.A.S., Executive Officer, Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, Tirupati-517 507.

## PUBLISHER'S NOTE 
Among the great Vaishnava acharyas, Sri Yamunacharya, also known as Alavandar, occupies a unique place. He has made substantial contributions to Visishtadvaita philosophy and established the pre-eminence of Sriman Narayana through his philosophical works and hymns. Sri Yamuna's "Stotraratna" occupies a special place in the devotional literature as it clothes philosophical ideas in poetic language.

The 'Strotra ratna' consisting of 65 verses conveys the basic ideas of Visishtadvaita philosophy like the relations of the individual self to the supreme and His Consort, the place of the triple path of karma, jnana and bhakti and the means for His Divine Grace. Above all, it emphasises the supreme significance of Prapatti or surrender to achieve salvation. Considered as a rare jewel among hymns, the 'Stotra ratna' calls upon us to surrender at the Lotus Feet of Lord Narayana.

The present translation of this well-known stotra by Dr. MS. Rajajee is refreshingly simple and lucid. The author, an able administrator and an ardent devotee of Lord Srinivasa, has admirably captured the original spirit of the verses. The translation along with an exhaustive commentary brings out the enduring charm of the 'Stotraratna' in a masterly style.

We take great delight in presenting this book to the theistic public and hope, in all humility, that they would derive immense spiritual benefit by reading this book.

P. Krishnaiah Executive Officer, TTD 

## FOREWORD 
I have immense pleasure in writing this Foreword to the English rendering of Sri Yamunacharya's Stotraratna done by Dr M.S.Rajajee, I.A.S., who held many high administrative positions such as the Chief Secretaryship to the Government of Andhra Pradesh and the Chairmanship of the Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission. Dr Rajajee is a man of many parts and his passion for philosophy and religion is at once amazing and abysmal. Born in a Srivaishnava family of great piety and nobility, he, notwithstanding the onerous responsibilities of his high office, has been finding time to study the cardinal works of this tradition and expound the truths contained therein in simple but effective English so that the layman who has no access to the original works in Sanskrit can catch their spirit and relive the glorious past in which the authors lived and wrote.

I have had the opportunity of going through his English annotation of the Mukundamala of Saint Kulasekhara, which, by all means, is the best-written one. The speciality of Dr Rajajee's style is its astounding simplicity marked by smoothness of flow and aptness of expression. Even the profoundest idea can be put across by him with commendable ease and dignity. This, in my opinion, is a rare quality to be found in translators. I have also seen a recent publication of the Satsampradaya Parirakshana Sabha, Warangal, which is an English translation by Dr Rajajee for the Satsampradaya Sudha written by one of our most erudite and prolific Srivaishnava Acharyas, Mahamahopadhyaya, Kavi-Sabdika Kesari, Sri U.Ve. S.N.C.Raghunathacharya Swami. Here again we find the translation very easy and telling, bringing out the spirit of the original in its best possible way.

The Stotraratna occupies a very high place in the hymnal literature of the Srivaishnavas of South India since it is the first hymn to have come from the pen of a great pre-Ramanuja writer who happened to be the grand-teacher of the great Ramanuja and the grandson of Nathamuni, the first Srivaishnava teacher whose works, the Nyayatattva and the Yogarahasya have not come down to us. The Stotraratna, along with the Sristuti or the Catussloki of the same Acharya are very significant in the Srivaishnava tradition. Clothing the philosophical ideas of the School in a poetic garb, they have inspired many later Srivaishnava writers to compose more detailed treatises, hymns and works highlighting the basic tenets of the School such as the Supremacy of Lord Vishnu, the glory of His highest abode called Srivaikuntha, the position of his consort Sri or Lakshmi and the efficacy of the paths of Bhakti and Prapatti in effecting salvation. Inspired by these hymns of Yamuna only Sri Ramanuja composed his Gadyatraya.

The present work viz., the Stotraratna has been quite popular with authors of texts on the Alankarasastra also. For instance, Sri Appaya Dikshita in his Kuvalayananda cites the verse "tavaamrita-syandini paada-pankaje..." (no.27) as an illustration for the figure of speech "Prativastupama" and the verse "abhutapurvam mama bhaavi." (No.25) as an example for the figure of speech called "Sambhava".

I am immensely happy to note that Dr Rajajee has done a commendable work on this important ancient Stotra of the Srivaishnava Literature. The popularity of this hymn is such that it is recited every day in every home of the orthodox Srivaishnavas. I take this opportunity to thank Dr Rajajee for giving me the opportunity of writing this Foreword to his translation, and to request him to carry on his literary activities. A gifted writer as he is, the benefit of his scholarship should reach the common masses who are well acquainted with English language but are not well-rooted in Sanskrit. I understand that he is currently making an in-depth study of the Ramayana written by poetess Molla in Telugu, with a view to present the beauties of that composition to the common people through the medium of English. I also understand that he is making a study of the Narasimha Kshetras and preparing an authoritative and exhaustive monograph on this very interesting subject. I wish him well in his enterprises and do earnestly hope that all his works will come in print so that the scholars and laymen alike can be benefited by his wisdom and scholarship.

## PREFACE 
Recently, I had undertaken a study of Kulasekhara Azhvar's "Mukunda Mala". I had completed the translation, with notes, in English. The TTD had published my work. I had seperately translated some scholarly lectures of Mahamahopadhyay Sri Raghunathacharya Svami varu of Warangal. These were published by the Veda Parirakshana Sabha of Warangal. I was therefore drawn to Vaishnavaite literature and took up a study of the Stotra Ratna, by Sri Yamunacharya. Sri Yamunacharya, as readers know, is pre Bhagavan Ramanuja and had laid the foundation for Visishtadvaita, though, it was not known by that name, at that time. I looked around for English translations, of this scholarly work. I found only two-one is an excellent translation, into English, without any comments, by Svami Adidevananda, of the Ramakrishna Mutt. The other one, an equally good translation, with brief notes, was by Sri S. Satyamurthi, of Gwalior, who has rendered great service to the readers by his many translation works and comments. The translation of Sri Satyamurthi, is based on the scholarly work in Tamil, by Sri Anangarachariar. The most outstanding work is, however that of Prof. Narasimhacharya, presently Head of the Dept. of Vaishnavism, of the Madras University. His is a scholarly dissertation on the "Contribution of Sri Yamunacharya to Visistadvaita". He presents Yamunacharya, on a much larger canvas. I felt that there was a need for a book, for people like me, who are not scholars, but would like to have a translation of this great work and would like to have detailed notes, about what others have said on the embedded thoughts. Hence, the present work.

I do not claim any scholarship to warrant my venturing to write such a book. That I should have attempted to do so can only be attributed to the great mysteries of life and to the divine will. On a particular day, I felt that I would like to write such a book and started this work, trusting the Divine Feet of the Lord. His unseen hand enabled me to complete this work. If it is was the unseen hand of the Lord that helped me to write the book, it is the seen hand of Prof. Narasimhacharya, which encouraged me at different stages. Prof. Narasimhacharya is very well known and needs no intruduction. He is heading the Department of Vaishnavism, Madras University and is widely known in Vaishnavaite, Sanskrit and Telugu literary circles. He has won many accolades for his contributions and has received many national awards. He combines in himself erudition, outstanding scholarship, a thorough understanding of the subject, an unmatched meticulousness and a rare humility. It was he who went through my manuscript and advised me to publish it, when I had doubts about the merit of my work. This does not mean that my work had any great merit; it shows that he has that unsual quality of encouraging fledgeling writers. I deem it as a rare honour conferred on me that he went through the manuscript and agreed to write an Intruduction.

I have kept Sri Anangarachari's commentary, in Telugu, as the basis for my work. I have amplified the comments, by quoting from the Srimad Bhagavatam, the Ramayana, the Narayaneeyam, the Stotras of Sri Vedanta Desika and my earlier translation with notes on Mukundamala. I gratefully acknowledge the quotations from the scholarly translation of Desika Stotras by Sri Raghavan, Dr Lakshmi Kumari and Prof Narasimhacharya. I am grateful to Prof Venkatakrishnan, Professor of Vaishnavism, Madras University, for having spared me a photo of an idol of Sri Yamunacharya in a temple, which adorns the cover page of this book.

I owe a great debt of gratitude to Sri Koteesvara Rao, working in the "Peshi" of the Chief Secretary's Office at Hyderabad. He did the typing work, willingly, with his usual efficiency and above all, most cheerfully. He did it during his spare hours, which really meant late, late hours of the night. I am deeply touched by the manner in which he did this work, as a labour of love. I am thankful to my family members, who encouraged me at different stages of the work.

I am very thankful to Dr I.V. Subba Rao, I.A.S., former EO of the TTD and the members of the Publication Committee, for having agreed to publish this work. I am deeply touched by the warm sentiments expressed by Sri Subba Rao, while accepting the book for publication. I am also grateful to the present EO, Sri P. Krishnaiah, IAS., who expedited this publication. I am thankful to Dr Ramamurthi, Editor, Saptagiri and his team of officers for the very efficient manner in which they took up and completed this work.

I place this work at the Feet of the Lord and seek His Divine Grace.

RajajeeIntroduction The is a work of 65 slokas, written by Sri Yamuna Acharya, also known as Alavandar. It is rated very highly in Vaishanavite literature and hence this Alavandar Stotra is known only as - a jewel among the stotras. It is a priceless jewel in the devotional literature and expounds the tenets of Vaishnavism. The later pillars of Vaishnavism, Ramanuja, Parasara Bhatta, Vedanta Desika and others derived their inspiration from this work. It is said that a recital of these slokas by Mahapurna, used to always cast an irresistible spell on Ramanuja. Sloka 11 in the used to cast a magic spell on Ramanuja. It is this same sloka which weaned away Ramanuja's cousin Govinda (known as Embar) from Saivism. In turn, Yamuna derived inspiration for his work from the Divya Prabandham and many slokas put across in mellifluous Sanskrit, are what had been stated in the Divya Prabhandham.

Sri Yamuna was born in 953 AD in Viranarayanapuram of Tamilnadu (not far from Cuddalore). He was the son of Ishwara Muni and the grandson of Sri Ranganatha Muni (known popularly as Nathamuni). It is said that Nathamuni and his family members were going on a pilgrimage in North India. As the conception took place on the banks of the river Yamuna, Sri Nathamuni gave the child the name Yamuna. Sri Ishwara Muni died at a young age. On the death of his son, Nathamuni renounced the world and became a recluse. The education of young Yamuna was left to Bhasya Bhattaraka.+++(5)+++ Yamuna was an excellent student and shone in all branches of studies.

Yamuna's teacher and all the others were under the rulership of a Pandyan king. The chief preceptor and religious disputant in the court was Vidvajjanakolahala. As his very name indicated, he threw all the learned people into turmoil, as he used to mercilessly vanquish them in scholarly debates. Yamuna's teacher was one among those who had been defeated. He was therefore required ...

You (who) shine with the four auspicious arms which reach upto the knees, which bear the rough scars of the bowstrings, which speak of the contact with Sri and have sweet-smelling fragrance and which are holy (when will I be able to serve You).

In the previous sloka the Lord had been described as one wearing a yellow raiment and His lustre had been described as also His broad chest, which was adorned by the Srivatsa mark. In this sloka, the reference is to his arms. The Lord is depicted as tall and handsome - ajanubaahu. His arms are adorning His sides and extend upto the knee joint. Hanuman crosses the ocean, proceeds to the Asoka vana, remains concealed in a tree, gently recites the story of Rama and introduces himself to Sita. Sita wants to be sure that he is an envoy of Lord Ramachandra and not a rakshasa 51 who has assumed the shape of a monkey. Sita asks Hanuman to describe the Lord. Hanuman says that He is four cubits tall and His arms extend upto the knees. Says Hanuman "....Sri Rama has eyes resembling a lotus petal. His countenance resembles the full moon. O, daughter of Janaka, he is richly endowed with charm from his birth. He vies with the sun in effulgence and with the earth in forbearance...." It is this long limbed Lord that Alavandar is describing in this sloka. Being long limbed is a sign of Lordship.

The arms bear the signs of friction with the bowstring. Yamuna does not draw a distinction between the Para roopa and avatara roopa. That is why while describing the Lord in the Para roopa, he refers to the marks made by the bowstring in the avatara roopa as Lord Ramachandra or Lord Krishna. Desika says much the same thing in a verse in "Sri Bhagavaddhyana Sopanam" The Lord (Ranganatha) reclines on the serpent. His four hands are handsome and generous, marked by the scars left by bracelets and bowstring are like huge bolts for the mansion of Lakshmi (His own chest)...." One may refer also to sloka 29 in 'Sri Devanayaka Panchasat'.

The goddess resides on the chest (please see above). Hence when She is resting on the arms of the Lord, her ear ornaments and ornaments worn on the head come into contact with the arms of the Lord and leave a mark. It is to this Alavandar makes a reference.

The goddess has bedecked her head with flowers. Hence, when she is resting on the arms of the Lord, the flowers leave their fragrance on the arms of the Lord. Sri Yamuna refers to this - "priya avatamsa utpala karnabhushana suladha alakabandha vimarda samsibih".

Whose conch-like neck is adorned by the lustre of the earrings which are extending upto the large and broad shoulders, whose sheen of face surpasses the lustre of the full moon as also the glow of red lotus, in full bloom (when will I serve You and be blessed?) Alavandar is now describing the shoulders, the curls of hair and the worshipful face. It is regarded as a royal sign to have three lines on the neck. The conch is believed to have three lines. Hence, the comparison of the neck to the conch is descriptive of royal excellence. Hence, Alavandar refers to the neck as conchlike ("kambu"). In the previous sloka, we had referred to Hanuman's description of Lord Ramachandra in reply to a query of Sita. In the same description, Hanuman refers to the Lord having three lines on his neck (and his belly). Desika in Sloka 28 of 'Sri Devanayaka Panchasat' says "...O Lord of the divine, my mind blooming beautifully entwines your conchlike neck like the Vanamala garland, which is darkened by Your lustre and which clearly bears the charming impressions of Sri's bangles." The shoulders of the Lord are, as is to be expected, broad and large. The Lord is wearing ear rings. These extend upto the shoulder and have a great shine, a great lustre.

Alavandar describes the sheen of the face as surpassing the lustre of the full bloom ("amritamsu bimba" and "amburuha"). Alavandar compares the face of the Lord to both the moon which is spotless ("nirmala") and to the blooming lotus because they both have an appeal of their own. The moon conveys a sense of serenity, peace and hence of subdued joy while the lotus conveys a sense of tenderness and charm. Desika also has a like statement, while refering to the curls and the face, "...O Lord of the celestials! This night in the Form of Your curly forelocks, through association with your moonlike face, with its beautiful nectar like pleasant53 smile becomes fit for our contemplation to remove the fever of transmigratory existence..." (Sloka 17 of 'Sri Devanayaka Panchasat').

Prabhuddha mugdhaambuja chaarulochanam Savibhrama bhrulatamujjvalaadharam Suchismitam komalagandam unnasam Lalaata paryanta vilambitaalakam.

Who has eyes which are beautiful like a lotus, who has graceful creeperlike brows, shining lips which have a half-smile, soft cheeks, prominent nose, curls hanging upto the forehead (when will I serve You and be blessed?) In the previous sloka, the prayer was addressed to the Lord, describing the whole of the face. In this sloka, the reference is to parts of the face - the eyes, the eyebrows, the cheeks, the lips and the nose. The eyes are compared to a fully bloomed lotus ("prabuddha mugdha ambuja"). The eye brows are graceful as creepers ("savibhrama bhrulatam"). The lips of the Lord are shining and He has a half-smile. In addition, the smile is pure ("suchi smitam"). But then, which part of the Lord is not pure? What is sought to be highlighted here is that the smile has no duplicity (unlike the smile of a king, who always practises duplicity). Or, the word "suchi" meaning "white", we can take it as referring to the whiteness of the smile, by way of poetic convention.

In the previous sloka, the curls were described as extending upto the big and broad shoulders. In this sloka, we are told that the curls are hanging down the forehead. ("lalata paryanta vilambitalakam"). The description in this sloka is of the frontal view.

54 Sri Yamunacharya's स्फुरत्किरीटाङ्गदहारकण्ठिकामणीन्द्रकाञ्चीगुणनूपुरादिभिः । रथाङ्गशङ्खासिगदाधनुर्वरैः लसत्तुलस्या वनमालयोज्ज्वलम् ॥ ३६ ॥

Sphurat-kirteetaangadahaara kanthikaa maneendra kaancheeguna noopuraadibhih rathaanga sankhaasi gadaa dhanurvaraih lasattulasyaa vanamaalayojjvalam.

(You) who are wearing a shining diadem, bracelets, a garland of pearls, a necklace, the kaustubha gem, the girdle and anklets, who has the five weapons, the conch, the discus, the sword, the club and the bow, who is wearing a garland of basil leaves (when will I be able to serve you and be blessed?).

In this sloka, the description is of the garlands, jewels adorning the Lord and the weapons of the Lord. The jewels are all shining ("sphurat"). What are they? Alavandar begins with the glorious crown ("kireeta") and then refers to "angada". This is what is popularly known as the "Keyuuram". He then refers to the "haara", "kanthika" (the neck adornment or the necklace), the kaustubha and the girdle ("kanchiguna"). The effulgent Lord can only be dazzling with all these adornments.

The sloka then goes on to describe the weapons of the Lord. They are the discus (poetically described as "Rathanga"), the conch ("sankha"), the sword ("asi"), the club ("gada"), and the bow ("dhanus").

The Lord is not just having the items of jewelleries and holding the weapons. He is wearing a garland of basil leaves ("thulasya vanamalaya). Alavandar calls it the shining ("lasat") garland. It is to highlight the fact that when the Lord wears a garland, even the garland shines, as it does not ever fade.

चकर्थ यस्या भवनं भुजान्तरं तव प्रियं धाम यदीयजन्मभूः ।

तया सहासीनमनन्तभोगिनि प्रकृष्टविज्ञानबलैकधामनि । फणामणिव्रातमयूखमण्डलप्रकाशमानोदरदिव्यधामनि ॥ ३९ ॥

Tayaa sahaasinam anantabhogini Prakrishta vijnaana balaika dhaamani Phanaa manivraata mayookha mandala - Prakaasamaanodara divyadhaamani.

59 (You who are) seated along with Sri, on the great serpent Ananta, who is the sole seat of excellent knowledge and great strength, in the divine abode in Vaikuntha, the inside of which is illumined by the rays emanating from the cluster of gems in the hoods (when will I be able to serve and be blessed?).

In this sloka and the next one, Ananta on whom the Lord is resting along with the Goddess is described. Adisesha is called in this sloka as "Anantabhogini". Even if the gandharvas, the apsaras and the siddhas become one, they cannot estimate the limit of His qualities. Hence, He is called "Ananta". "Bhoga" refers to the hoods (the thousand headed Ananta). One who has these is the Bhogi and hence the description as "Anantabhogi".

He has been described as "prakrishta vijnana balaika dhaaman". He has great knowledge of the six sastras and is "the abode" of knowledge (vijnana dhama). He is able to bear the Lord who is resting on him. He has to have great strength. Hence he is "balaika dhaama".

Adisesha is reputed to have sparkling gems in his hoods. These gems are shiny and have such lustre that they are lighting up the whole of Vaikuntham. That is why the description has been given as "prakasamaana phanaamanivraata". On such an Adisesha, the Lord and Sri are resting on the middle portion.

निवासशय्यासनपादुकांशुको - पधानवर्षातपवारणादिभिः ।

शरीरभेदैस्तव शेषतां गतैः यथोचितं शेष इतीरिते जनैः ॥ ४० ॥

Nivaasa sayyaasanapaadukaamsukopadhaana varshaatapa vaaranaadibhih sareerabhedhais tava seshataam gataih yathochitam sesha itiri (rya) te janaih.

60 Sri Yamunacharya's (You who are resting on Sesha) who has been aptly called by the devotees as Sesha, on account of the different forms he assumes for serving you as a residence, as a couch, as a throne, as sandals, as a pillow and as a shelter from the sun and rain (when will I be able to serve you and be blessed?).

"Seshatva" means not caring for oneself and doing good for others, always. Since he is serving the Lord at all times as a couch, as a seat, as a throne, as a pillow, as an umbrella etc., he is called Sesha. Since he is first among those who render service, he is called Adisesha. One may not entertain any doubt as to how Adisesha functions as a divine abode ("nivasa"), as a couch ('sayya), throne ("asana") but one may wonder how he is useful as the foot rest or as the umbrella. When the Lord gets off Adisesha, He steps on the coils of Adisesha and then only gets off. When, the Lord is resting, Adisesha spreads out the hood and protects Him. There is a description in the Srimad Bhagavatam. When the Lord is born to Devaki in the middle of the night and Vasudeva is directed to carry the newborn babe across the river, Adisesha walks behind Vasudeva, with the hoods spread out to protect Krishna from the pouring rain. Adisesha is therefore, both the couch and the canopy of the Lord.

Just as Yamuna has described the Lord as resting on Adisesha (who doubles up as manifold other items), Kulasekhara has a picturesque description of the Lord. Says he in, Sloka 39: "Obeisance to Lord Madhava, enemy of the asura Madhu His beautiful form lying on the couch of the serpent Ananta, Is sparkled by the shower of spray from the waves of the milk ocean, Making him bedecked by a cluster of stars".

ETA: AREN ENGGIATETİ AGT: यस्ते वितानं व्यजनं त्रयीमयः ।

उपस्थितं तेन पुरो गरुत्मता त्वदङ्घ्रिसंमर्दकिणाङ्कशोभिना ॥ ४१ ॥

Daasah sakhaa vaahanam aasanam dhvajo yas te vitaanam vyajanam trayeemayah upastitham tena puro garutmataa tvad anghri-sammarda-kinaanka sohibina.

61 You having Garuda as Your servant, Your friend, Your vehicle, Your seat, Your banner, Your canopy to protect You from the rain and the sun, who is shining as a result of the scars received from the contact with Your feet, whose form is made up of the Vedas (when will I be able to serve You and be blessed?).

Just as in the previous sloka, Adisesha was described, Garuda Alwar is described in this sloka. The sloka begins with the words "daasah" and "sakhaa". They refer to a dependent person and to a friend. Garuda is both a dependent person and a friend. He is a dependent person because it is the Lord who saved him and subsequently accepted him as a mount. He is also a friend. In the Rama avatara, Ramachandra is felled by the Nagaastra. It is Garuda who comes there and frees Ramachandra from the nooselike bonds of the serpents. Ramachandra required to be freed, because he had adopted a human form in this avatara.

Adisesha renders service to the Lord, when the Lord is in Vaikuntham. As stated in the previous sloka, he is the seat, the throne and the canopy. In the same manner, Garuda is the seat, the vehicle and the banner when the Lord is on the move. The Lord has to move here and there in response to the appeals of the devotees. He has to rush to their rescue. Since both render service and provide a seat, the words "daasa" and "asana" have been used in respect of both Adisesha and Garuda.

When the Lord is coursing through the skies, He should not be exposed to the sun and rain and He should also feel comfortable. That is why Garuda provides a canopy ("vitanam") and also provides a fan ("vyajanam") in the form of the flapping wings. Garuda is addressed as "trayimayah". He symbolizes the Vedas. The Yajurveda has a sloka to this effect.

Garuda has some shining scars. This is because, the Lord rushes to the rescue of those who beseech Him, as in the case of 62 Sri Yamunacharya's Gajendra. Though Garuda is taking the Lord with great speed (to which we will make a reference a little later), the Lord, out of compassion for the supplicants who are beseeching him, wants Garuda to fly faster still and nudges him with his feet. These leave some scars ("tvadt anghri sammarda"). These scars are themselves shining.

What Yamuna has succinctly put in one sloka has been elaborated by Desika into several slokas in his two stotras "Sri Garuda Dandaka" and "Sri Garuda Panchasat". In sloka 1 of Sri Garuda Dandaka, Desika eulogizes Garuda as "I praise Garuda who is seated in the nest of the Vedas, whose shoulders have become the seat for the powerful Lord Vishnu...." While in sloka (2) he refers to Garuda (among other things) by saying "your greatness is established by ascending the victorious banner of the enemy of the demons (that is the banner of Lord Vishnu)..." Yamuna had said that Garuda symbolizes the Vedas. Says Desika in Sloka (2) of Sri Garuda Panchasat: "May that Mantra of Garuda in which Garuda (embodying the Veda) manifests himself within and without along with his import (ie., Lord Vishnu) protect us..." In sloka (3) he says that the Vedas proclaim that the eye of Garuda is the Gayatri-sama, his name the Yajurmantras, his limbs are the metres etc. Yamuna had said that Garuda fans the Lord. Says Desika in Sloka 14 (ibid) that the wind produced by the flapping of the wings was capable of throwing the stars around like cubes of ice and divide the ocean into two halves (Sloka 33) so as to enable Garuda to dive into the nether world. Yamuna has described Garuda as the friend and banner. Says Desika (Ibid, Sloka 46) that Garuda is Lord Vishnu's speedy canopy, the befitting fan, the victorious flag, the friend who decimates enemies and an indispensable servant. While Yamuna says that while Garuda was moving fast, the Lord nudges him with the feet to make him move faster still, Desika puts it differently. Says Desika (Sloka 47, Ibid) "May the magnanimous Lord of Birds, who went ahead of the mind of Lord Vishnu, who was worried at the thought of the elephant in the grip of the crocodile, destroy our predicament of falling into hell...."त्वदीयभुक्तोज्झितशेषभोजिना त्वया निसृष्टात्मभरेण यद्यथा । प्रियेण सेनापतिना न्यवेदि तत् तथानुजानन्तमुदारवीक्षणैः ॥ ४२ ॥

Tvadeeya bhuktojjhita seshabhojinaa tvayaa nisrishtaatma bharena yad yathaa priyena senaapatinaa nyavedi tat tathaanujaanantam udaara veeksanaih.

63 (O Lord) Your Commander-in-chief, Vishvaksena, who eats the left overs, after You have taken your food, he who is beloved of You, who enjoys his power only because of You, who secures Your assent through Your lofty glances and significant looks, for the submissions made by him (when will I be able to serve and be blessed?).

In the previous two slokas, Adisesha and Garuda had been eulogized. In this sloka, the reference is to Vishvaksena. Though all the Nityasuris are equal, it is only in this sloka, the word "priyena" (the one who is beloved of you) is used. Maybe for this reason, it is said that Parasara Bhattar often used to give discourses on this sloka alone.

Vishvaksena is the commander-in-chief of the army. He is delegated with authority by the Lord. He accordingly exercises his powers. On occasions, he may have to seek the approval of the Lord, either for what he has done or for what is proposed to be done. On such occasions, the Lord would accord his approval by a mere glance ("udaara veekshanaih") when the proposal was submitted to him ("nyavedi").

Vishvaksena is referred to as one who eats what is left by the Lord. What is the significance? Any devotee more so a Nityasuri will only eat whatever is the residue, after the food (naivedya) is offered to the Lord. Since among the Nityasuris, he enjoys a special position with the Lord, being "priyena", this point of "seshabhojana" is emphasised. Vishvaksena eats what is left by 6 64 Sri Yamunacharya's the Lord and exercises the power given by the Lord (tvaya nisrishta atmabharena).

हताखिलक्लेशमलैः स्वभावतः त्वदानुकूल्यैकरसैस्तवोचितैः । गृहीततत्तत्परिचारसाधनैः निषेव्यमाणं सचिवैर्यथोचितम् ॥ ४३ ॥

Hataakhila klesa malaih svabhaavatah tvad aanukoolyaikarasaih tavochitaih grheeta tat-tat-parichaara saadhanaih nishevyamaanam sachivaih yathochitam.

You are attended on by a host of Nityasuris, who by their nature are untainted by afflictions and blemishes, and who by their singular devotion are fully equipped to serve you in the most appropriate manner and are best suited to attend on you (when will I be able to serve you and be blessed?).

In the previous slokas Ananta, Garuda and Vishvaksena had been hymned. Alavandar now eulogizes the Nityasuris - those who are always attending on the Lord at Vaikuntham. These people are not contaminated by afflictions - attractions and repulsive things, caused by and through worldly contacts. They seek pleasure only by and in serving the Lord. Yamuna seeks the Lord, who is attended on by this retinue.

The Nityasuris do not have (have lost) "klesha" and "malaih", that is sorrows and sins. They are free from afflictions like Avidya (ignorance), Ahankara (ego), Raga, Dvesha (likes and hatred). The sloka has the word "svabhavatah" as a word preceding the above, meaning that the Nityasuris are naturally free from the afflictions, as the Nityasuris have never been contaminated with the sins of "samsara", while on the other hand, the "muktas" or the liberated souls have only through an effort succeeded in liberating themselves from the samsaric bonds. Hence, the use of the word "svabhavatah".

These nityasuris are singularly (ekarasaih) devoted to serving the Lord (tvat anukulya). They are fully equipped for serving 65 the Lord (tattat parichara sadhanah). "Equipped" here should be interpreted to mean that they have the fan, the whisk etc., for offering service to the Lord.

अपूर्वनानारसभावनिर्भरप्रबुद्धयां मुग्धविदग्धलीलया । क्षणाणुवत् क्षिप्तपरादिकालया प्रहर्षयन्तं महिषीं महाभुजम् ॥ ४४ ॥

Apoorva naanaarasa bhaava nirbhara prabuddhayaa mugdha vidagdha leelayaa, kshanaanuvat kshiptaparaadi kaalayaa praharshayantam mahimsheem mahaabhujam.

You, who are of long arms, exhilarate Sri with lovely and skilful sport, which consists of diverse and new sentiments and emotions as to make aeons of time pass quickly, like brief moments.

In slokas 37, 38 and part of 39, the reference was to Sri alone. In this sloka, Alavandar is hymning the Lord sporting with Sri. In a sense, this sloka is complementary to sloka (38). In sloka (38), it was mentioned that the Lord enjoys the bliss of perpetual communion with Sri and that Sri surprises the Lord with her ever fresh attributes. In this sloka, the reference is to the "leela" (plays) of the Lord. They are fresh and many ("apoorva" and "nana"). They are to make the Queen ("mahishim") the goddess, in this case, happy. What is the duration of these "leelas"? Two words are used "para" and "adi". The word "para" refers to the lifetime of Brahma while the word "Adi" refers to the lifetime of crores of Brahmas. Though the "leelas" may be for an eternally long time, it appears as if it was for a fraction of a second ("kshana anuvat").

अचिन्त्यदिव्याद्भुतनित्ययौवनस्वभावलावण्यमयामृतोदधिम् ।

श्रियः श्रियं भक्तजनैकजीवितं समर्थमापत्सखमर्थिकल्पकम् ॥ ४५ ॥

1805 66 Sri Yamunacharya's Achintya divyaadbhuta nitya yauvanasvabhaava laavanya mayaamritodadhim shriyah shriyam bhaktajanaika jeevitam samartham aapatsakham arthikalpakam.

(You) who are the nectar ocean of natural beauty, who have perpetual (eternal) youth, beyond all comprehension, You who are the fortune of the goddess of Fortune herself, are the sustaining force of the devotees, are the great helper in adversity and are a veritable wish-yielding tree to the supplicants (when will I be able to serve you and be blessed?).

The qualities of the Lord are enumerated - His eternal youth, sustaining force for the devotees, the one who helps at all times, and gives all that the supplicants seek. In this sloka we see a description of the divya-mangala-vigraha and the divya-atmasvaroopa, that is a description of both the physical and psychic aspects of the Lord.

The Lord is the nectar ocean of natural beauty. What this means is that the beauty of the Lord has the appeal of nectar. There is no satiety and one feels like quaffinig it, again and again. This is partly because the Lord is eternally handsome and in appearance is perpetually youthful. ("nitya yauvana"). We have used the words "partly because" in the above sentence, as it is not just the youthfulness or the handsome features which makes us to feast our eyes on him. It is an innate and inherent quality of perpetual appeal.

The Lord is beyond comprehension. He is beyond description. One may recall the Vishvaroopa darsana, sought and had by Arjuna. Arjuna was petrified when he saw in the Lord hundreds of Brahmas and the Lord had an effulgence equal to many Suns.

The Lord is the sustaining force for the devotees ("bhaktajana ekajivitam"), the great helper in adversity ("aapat sakham") and the veritable wish/yielding tree to the supplicants ("arthi kalpakam"). It may be noticed that there is a graceful set up in the above three descriptions. He sustains the devotees at all times, whether they are prosperous or not. When adversity strikes, He helps the devo67 tee, to tide over the difficulty. The devotee or the supplicant seeks something, which the Lord grants immediately. These are so well depicted in the episodes of Prahlada and Gajendra.

The Lord is the fortune of the goddess of Fortune ("shriyah shriyam"). The goddess gives refuge to all the supplicants. The Lord gives refuge to Sri Herself. It may be recalled that in sloka 12, Yamuna had written "kah Srih sriyah - who else but you (is the source of prosperity even for Sri) the resting place for Lakshmi". It may be mentioned that in Sloka (11) of Mukunda Mala, Kulasekhara Alwar says ".......How can your enemies touch you, your enemies being the sins that you have accumulated, when your master is Sridhara, the husband of goddess Sri...." Parasara Bhattar has expressed identically "Shriyah Shri Rangesayah".

While describing the Lord, in line 4, the word "samartham" (capable) occurs in isolation. What is he capable of? The answer is what is the Lord not capable of? The Lord is capable of making the common devotees experience what Nitya Suris are experiencing.

भवन्तमेवानुचरन् निरन्तरं प्रशान्तनिः शेषमनोरथान्तरः । कदाऽहमैकान्तिकनित्यकिङ्करः प्रहर्षयिष्यामि सनाथजीवितः ॥ ४६ ॥

Bhavantam evaanucharan nirantaram prashanta-nissesha manorathaantarah kadaaham aikaantika nitya kinkarah praharshayisyaayami sanaathajeevitah.

Constantly waiting on you alone, having turned away from all other desires, not having any one other than you and serving you alone, having you alone as the Lord, when will I be blessed (when will I reach you?).

What is begun in Sloka 32 is concluded in Sloka 46 with the word "bhavantam" (More on this word later in the note on this sloka). The seeker, the beseecher has been constantly or eternally 68 Sri Yamunacharya's ("nirantaram") waiting ("anusaran") on the Lord. He has not sought or pursued other desires ("prashaanta nissesha manorathantharah"). He has been serving only the Lord ("Aikantika nitya kinkarah"). It may be noted that both the words have been used --waiting on the Lord and serving only the Lord. Apart from the emphasis to be conveyed, it is possible to wait on one and still manage to serve another also. Yamuna makes it clear that he has been serving only the Lord.

Yamuna uses also the word "sanathajivitah". He has become an orphan, essentially due to the lack of grace of the Lord. This orphanship can be cured only by the will of the Lord to shower His Grace on the hapless devotee.

The concluding words "bhavantam praharshayishyami" needs a special comment. Translated literally this means, "when will I make you happy?" (and not when will you make me happy). Where is the question of the devotee making the Lord happy? Is it happiness for the beseecher or the One who blesses when the devotee attains the Lord? Sampradaya tells us that the reclamation of the jiva gives greater happiness to the Lord as it is a gain for the Svami. The pleasure or happiness which the Lord derives from such reclamation makes the jiva also happy, but the source of such happiness is the Lord.

70 70 अपराधसहस्रभाजनं पतितं भीमभवार्णवोदरे ।

अगतिं शरणागतं हरे कृपया केवलमात्मसात् कुरु ॥ ४८ ॥

Aparaadha sahasra bhaajanam patitam bheema-bhavaarnavodare, agatim saranaagatam Hare! kripayaa kevalam aatmasaatkuru.

Sri Yamunacharya's Out of Your sheer grace, please make me Your own - me who am fallen into the depths of the terrible ocean of worldly existence and who being unable to resort to any one else, have sought refuge at your feet.

In a sense, this sloka continues from sloka 23 and 24. In sloka 23, it had been said that all the sinful acts had been committed hundreds of times and when the time to suffer for these had come, he is crying helplessly before the Lord. In sloka (24), it had been said that when he was drowning in the ocean of samsara, he had found the Lord. In sloka 47, Alavandar had piteously cried that he is ineligible to receive the grace of the Lord and needs to be condemned for his various bad qualities. For this reason, is he to stand aside, so that he may be passed over? No. Instead, he appeals to Hari. Who is Hari? As the name itself symbolizes, He is One who washes off the sins of the sinner, provided he approaches the Lord and does "saranagati" so that the Lord may make him as His person.

He appeals to Hari. Please see the third line in the sloka. He confesses that he has committed hundreds of sins ("aparaadha sahasra bhajanam"). He has fallen into the middle of the fierce ocean called samsara ("bhima bhava arnava udare patitam). He does saranagati and seeks the grace of the Lord ("kevalam kripaya") to make him the Lord's man ("atmasat kuru"). It is part of Vaishnava sampradaya to recite this sloka, when one goes to a shrine to offer worship.

71 One may refer here to sloka (9) of Mukunda Mala. Says Kulasekhara. "I plunge in the sacred lake called Hari....the depth of the lake is unknown; but the very touch of its waters is most refreshing. I plunge in this lake and drink of the divine light that is its water and leave aside the long drawn weariness of my wanderings in that vast mirage of a world".

अविवेकघनान्धदिङ्गुखे बहुधा सन्ततदुःखवर्षिणि । भगवन् भवदुर्दिने पथः स्खलितं मामवलोकयाच्युत ॥ ४९ ॥

Aviveka ghanaandha-dingmuke bahudhaa santata-duhkha-varshini Bhagavan! bhava-durdine pathah - skhalitam maam avalokayaachyuta! I who have lost my sense of direction and moved away from the path of rectitude, bewildered by the cloudy day, called samsara, enveloped in dark dense clouds of ignorance and beaten continously by ever expanding miseries, O Achyuta, please look on me.

This sloka elaborates what was said in sloka 22. The Lord is both the 'upaya' and the 'upeya'.

The day when the shining sun is not seen is a gloomy day. "Samsara" has been compared to a gloomy day ("bhava durdine"). Ignorance is like a cloud ("aviveka ghana"). This cloud of ignorance is covering the rays of the Sun, called knowledge. The rain which is coming down due to the cloud (ignorance) is the samsaric sorrow ('santata dukha varshini'). Because of all this, he has lost the way. Alavandar is praying to the Lord to show him the way, to him who has lost his way due to "samsara" (pathah skhalitam maam avalokaya").

Alavandar is addressing the Lord - bhagavan. The Lord alone is capable of giving him liberation. He is further addressed as Achyuta - one who remains steadfast by His devotees. Alavandar 72 Sri Yamunacharya's wishes to reinforce his prayer by reminding Him that He is Achyuta and therefore does not address Him by the other names. He calls Samsara as a gloomy day (bhava durdine) to emphasise that it is what is opposed to the salvation of the individual. It is this same samsara which has made him to lose his way meaning that it is what made him to stray from the path of dharma. What does he seek from the Lord? He calls on the Lord to look ('avalokaya'), meaning to have mercy on him, to shower His grace on him so that he gives up his 'aviveka'.

न मृषा परमार्थमेव मे श्रृणु विज्ञापनमेकमग्रतः । यदि मे न दयिष्यसे ततो zenferana -ner gefur: || 40 || Na mrishaa paramaartham eva me srinu vijnaapanam ekam agratah, yadi me na dayishyase tato dayaneeyah tava naatha durlabhah.

O Lord, listen to my prayer that is genuine, and without a trace of falsehood. If You do not take pity on me, it will be difficult to find one more worthy of compassion.

Alavandar had said in sloka 24 that the Lord had found in him a worthy recipient for his mercy. He had said in sloka 25 that it is not becoming of the Lord if those who had sought Him were to become frustrated. It is possible that the Lord may tell Alavandar that there are many others in this position, like him and that being so, how is he different and how is his seeking compassion, to be treated differently. Alavandar anticipates this question of the Lord and replies in the sloka.

Though there may be many who need to be saved by the Lord, for the person who is seeking the grace of the Lord, the Lord alone is the saviour. In this sloka, it is being said that the Lord would not find one who has more deficiencies. That being73 so, if the Lord were to now ignore him, then the grace of the Lord would be wasted. Saving him is the immediate duty of the Lord, as the Lord would find it difficult to locate one on whom He can show grace, if He passes over the hymnologist.

This concept of the protectee submitting to the Lord that he is the most eligible sinner has been used by Desika in several slokas. Says Desika in Daya Satakam: "O Daya, when I, the foremost among sinners, am present here, how are you able to survive on the limited sins of others, which will not be sufficient to fill Your stomach?" (Sloka 29).

"O Daya! I am the emperor among sinners and You are the empress of all virtues. O knowledgeable one, knowing this situation, You, of Your own accord, come and place me at the feet of the Lord" (Sloka 30).

Again, says Desika in Saranagati Dipika, "O Master! Every moment I do things which are not to be done, as if they are to be done. I give up things which are to be actually performed by me, as if they are to be avoided. There is also a host of other violations (done by me). May Grace, the empress among your qualities, take the place of means (of saving) in my case: (Sloka 44) "O Lord, long ago you yourself had said that compassion to those who seek refuge is the highest virtue. Because you are the One who gives refuge, you are now being reminded by me. Indeed, these undertakings of yours are meant for people like me. Is it not?" (Sloka 45).

"O Bhagavan, enough of Your going on thinking about me. I, the bold one, bear the name of a prapanna. Therefore, make me the object of Your grace, so as to avoid Your getting a bad name (Since You have already promised to protect a person who even entertains the idea of doing prapatti"). (Sloka 50) 74 तदहं त्वदृते न नाथवान् मदृते त्वं दयनीयवान् न च । विधिनिर्मितमेतमन्वयं भगवन् पालय मा स्म जीहपः ॥ ५१ ॥

Tadaham tvadrite na naathavaan madrute tvam dayaneeyavaan na cha vidhinirmitam etam anvayam Bhagavan! Paalaya maasma jeehapah.

Sri Yamunacharya's Lord, without You, I am lost and without me, You lose a worthy recipient for your compassion. This relationship of Your Lordship and my (state of) pitiableness, needs to be preserved. This has been ordained by fate.

This sloka takes forward the plea made in the previous sloka (sloka 50) wherein it was stated that if the Lord did not save him, He would find it difficult to find another ('tatah tava dayaniyah durlabhah"). The plea now is that there is none other than the Lord and for the Lord there is none else who better deserves compassion. He says that there is no other lord (ananthavan) for him and for the Lord there is none else ("madrute") to shower His compassion. One who deserves the compassion of the Lord is one who is struggling because he has committed sins. One who most deserves the compassion of the Lord is, by the above logic, one who is greatly suffering because he has committed limitless sins. Alavandar says in this sloka that if the Lord were to leave him, he would not find one who better deserves compassion. He says that there is always this connection for him there is none else than the Lord and for the Lord there is none else than him.

Alavandar goes on to say that this relationship of Protector - Protectee is fated ("vidhinirmitam"). This raises a question. Apart from the Lord, is there such a thing called "fate", for it to be said that this relationship is fated?. Here, the word 'vidhi' or fate is not as is commonly understood. It is not destiny. It is the Divine Grace which forges the mutual bonds between man and God.

75 In the previous sloka, we had quoted from Vedanta Desika to explain how he had also expatiated on the theme of the beseecher being the most sinful person. Since this sloka of Yamuna carried forward the same theme, we may once again, with advantage, quote from Desika. Says Desika in "Sri Devanayaka Panchasat": "O Vibudhanatha, having obtained me, who is an oçan of ignorance, leader of the wrong doers, breaker of commands and emperor among the destitute, why do You, the omniscient, think of any one else as the proper recipient of your compassion?" (Sloka 49).

Says Desika in Nyasa Dasakam: "O Divine Lord, Remover of the distress of those who bow down! Forgive every thing - my doing forbidden things and not doing things that ought to be done". (Sloka 9).

ayurfag atsfor antsftat quatsanfa eren aenfarer: I तदयं तव पादपद्मयोः अहमद्यैव मया समर्पितः ॥ ५२ ॥

Vapuraadisu yo' pi ko'pi vaa gunato asaani yathaatathaavidhah tad ayam tava paadapadmayoh aham adyaiva mayaa samarpitah.

Whatever might be the nature of the body and my organs, with which I am endowed, according to the Gunas of Prakriti, I am offering them this very moment at Your lotus feet, as also what is denoted as I in me.

Alavandar had stated in the previous sloka that the Lord needs to protect the relationship between the Lord and himself. The Lord asks Alavandar that for quite some time now there has been a discussion between Alavandar and himself as to whether he belongs to himself or to the Lord and that this has not been resolved. That being the position, how can the Lord accept the proposition of Alavandar pertaining to the protector and protectee? It is this 76.

Sri Yamunacharya's question which Alavandar answers in this sloka. He says that there is no such discussion as to whom Alavandar belongs. He belongs to the Lord only. Hence he makes an offering of himself - of his body and organs. In this context sloka 10 may also be seen.

In the fourth line of the sloka the word "aham" is used. This is to be taken to mean "atma". The 'atma' has been said to be different things by different persons. Some say that the body is the atma; some say that the prana is the atma; some say that it is intelligence. Alavandar does not wish to enter into any such intellectual disputation. He says that in the opinion of the Lord whatever form 'atma' assumes, Alavandar is willing to submit at the lotus feet of the Lord that 'aham' ("Ayamham tava padapadmayoh adya eva maya samarpitah"). In effect, what Alavandar is saying is that what is important is servitude.

Alavandar is submitting to the Lord that he is giving up his attachment to the organs, to the body and not being able to realise the self, he is solely depending on the feet of the Lord and that the Lord should save him (as He did save Gajendra and Draupadi).

मम नाथ यदस्ति योऽस्म्यहं सकलं तद्धि तवैव माधव ।

नियतस्वमिति प्रबुद्धधीः ereran fang fenfa à || 43 || Mama naatha! Yad asti yo asmy aham sakalam taddhi tavaiva Maadhava! niyatasvam iti prabhuddha dhih Athavaa kim nu samarpayaami te? O Lord, whatever I have and whatever I am, all these are yours. What shall I then offer You? O Madhava, being awakened to the conciousness that all these are Your inalienable property, there is nothing else left for me to offer.

In the previous sloka, Alavandar had said that he is offering the body and the 'aham' at the feet of the Lord. But having realized that he is in servitude, Alavandar entertains a doubt. When 77 he is already in servitude, is it appropriate for him to offer the body and the organs, as if he is independent? He therefore, hurriedly, clarifies the position. He says that whatever he has and whatever he is, is already that of the Lord ("niyatasvam"). He has nothing else to offer.

In this sloka, the Lord has been addressed as "Madhava" to signify his eternal Lordship. We are all dependent on the goddess Sri and She is dependent on the Lord.

अवबोधितवानिमां यथा मयि नित्यां भवदीयतां स्वयम् । कृपयैवमनन्यभोग्यतां भगवन् भक्तिमपि प्रयच्छ मे ॥ ५४ ॥

Avabodhitavaan imaam yathaa mayi nityam bhavadeeyataam savayam kripayaivam ananya bhogyataam bhagavan! bhaktim api prayachcha me.

Just as You have awakened in me the consciousness of being eternally Yours, O Lord, grant me, out of compassion, that devotion which consists of enjoying You alone.

Alavandar had said in sloka (52) that he is offering at the feet of the Lord his body and organs. In sloka (53), he had said that whatever "I have is yours and what then, shall I offer you?" Thus, the knowledge that he is eternally that of the Lord has been awakened. Since the knowledge has been awakened, the Lord seems to ask what he would like to have in this world. Alavandar's gratitude is encapsulated in this sloka.

He begins by stating that the Bhagavan has himself awakened in him ("avabodhitavan") the consciousness of being eternally ('nityam') His. The Lord should, in the same manner, give him the devotion to enjoy Him alone ('ananya bhogyatam').

Alavandar does not wish to have any other enjoyment and specifically so prays to the Lord. A question may be asked that a supplicant can seek liberation, but is it correct to make a specific 78 Sri Yamunacharya's plea to the Lord, more so for Alavandar? It has been laid down that devotees cannot seek food, water, wealth, clothes, a house and longevity from the Lord, even in times of acute distress. But it is permitted to seek liberation or to seek devotion to the feet of the Lord.

In this connection, the episode of Kuchela may be recalled. Kuchela comes home and finds opulence every where. He prays to the Lord that though the Lord had given him, unasked, extreme wealth, he should never forget his devotion to the feet of the Lord. Seeking such devotion is in order. Kulasekhara Alwar says similarly in Mukunda Mala (sloka 15): "O let me not look at those hapless creatures who do not turn their thoughts to Your feet. I will not listen to stories other than those relating to Your pastimes, which stories are worth hearing. O Lord of the universe, let me pay no attention to those who avoid thinking of You. Let me be able to serve You, birth after birth". Thus, while Kulasekhara concludes by praying that he wishes to serve the Lord, birth after birth, Yamuna concludes that he wishes to have that devotion which consists of enjoying Him alone.

तव दास्यसुखैकसङ्गिनां भवनेष्वस्त्वपि कीटजन्म मे । इतरावसथेषु मास्म भूत् अपि मे जन्म चतुर्मुखात्मना ।। ५५ ।।

Tava daasya sukhaika sanginaam bhavaneshvastvapi keetajanma me itaraavasatheshu maasma bhoot api me janma chaturmukhaatmanaa.

May I be born even as a worm in the houses of those who are solely devoted to the joy of serving You. But, let me not be born even as the four faced Brahma in the houses of those who are not Your devotees.

In the previous sloka, the prayer was only for the enjoyment of devotion to the feet of the Lord. Is this enough? No. That devo79 tion has to increase. For this to happen, it is necessary to be in the community of devotees and not of non-devotees.

Those who render service to the Lord are "bhagavathas". To render service to those who are rendering service to the Lord is the first step in devotion (it would also be the ultimate step, because more than service to Him, the Lord prefers service to His devotees). To render service to the devotees, one has to be in that group or be born in the houses of those who are serving the Lord. How significant or insignificant such a birth is, is immaterial. That is why Alavandar says that he would prefer to be born even as a worm, an insect ('kita janma') in the houses of those who are solely devoted ('ekasanginam') to the joy of serving the Lord ('dasyasukha'). In this connection, apart from sloka (15) of Mukunda Mala to which we made a reference in the previous sloka, we would make reference also to sloka (27) in Mukunda Mala. Says Kulasekhara, "O slayer of Madhu and Kaitabha, O lord of the Universe, the fruition of my life and the most cherished mercy You could show me would be for You to consider me the servant of Your servant....." Kulasekhara prefers to be a servant, seven degrees removed. Yamuna prefers to be an insect in the house of the devotees.

In sloka (2) of chapter (2) of the Srimad Bhagavatam, there is an excellent summarization of one who is not devoted to the Lord. Says Sage Saunaka: "A man has really lived, only during those moments of his life, that have been spent in the thought of the Lord. Vain are the lives of the rest, their lifespan being merely food for time to swallow through its jaws of sunrise and sunset. Do not trees live their lifespan? Do not bellows take in and set out air? Do not animals, wild and domestic, eat and mate? Alas, what is human life worth, if it fulfills only these very same functions? He who into whose ears, the Lord's name has not entered, he is a man in form, but only an animal - a dog, a pig, a camel, an ass or the like. That ear into which words dealing with the Lord's excellences have not entered is a mere cavity and nothing more... the eyes that are not 7 80 Sri Yamunacharya's accustomed to see the images of the Lord and holy men, are as purposeless as the eyes in the centre of the feathers of a peacock....a man whose heart is unmoved, whose eyes shed not tears and hairs stand on end when the Lord's names are uttered - he verily is possessed of a heart of stone...." That is why Yamuna says that he does not wish to be born even as the four faced Brahma in the houses of ('avasatheshu') of persons who are not the devotees.

सकृत् त्वदाकारविलोकनाशया तृणीकृतानुत्तमभुक्तिमुक्तिभिः । महात्मभिर्मामवलोक्यतां नय groìsfa à afgeìsfag: #6: 11 48 11 Sakrit tvadaakaara vilokanaasayaa trineekritaanuttama-bhukti-muktibhih mahaatmabhir maam avalokyataam naya kshanepi te yadvirahotidussahah.

Make me an object worthy of the benign look of great souls, who with the object of having a single glance at You, have even given up the highest enjoyments and liberation. Separation from such great souls is unendurable to You.

In the previous sloka, the prayer was to be with the devotees and not to be with the non-devotees. The Lord may ask what he hopes to achieve? The answer is in this sloka.

The prayer is that those great people from whom separation is unendurable for the Lord, should cast a benign look on him. What have these great people done? They have rejected (the word used is "trinikrita", that is treated as a blade of grass) even the highest enjoyment ("bhukti") and liberation ("mukti") so that they may have a glance at the Lord ("akara vilokana asaya").

Why should separation from such devotees be unendurable to the Lord (yad virahah te kshanepi ati dussahah")? It is for the simple reason that the Lord resides where the bhagavathas reside. Hence, He cannot bear separation from them.

81 There is a difference between the previous sloka and this sloka. In the previous sloka, the prayer was that he should be born in the house of the devotees whereas in this sloka the hymnologist only seeks that such great souls should glance ('avalokyatam') at him.

न देहं न प्राणान् न च सुखमशेषाभिलषितं न चात्मानं नान्यत् किमपि तव शेषत्वविभवात् । बहिर्भूतं नाथ क्षणमपि सहे यातु शतधा विनाशं तत् सत्यं मधुमथन विज्ञापनमिदम् ॥ ५७ ॥

I am enveloped in Rajas and Tamas. I am incapable, but I pretend to be capable and have composed this text of feigned praise. Atleast making this as the reason, please save me. O Dharanidhara (sustainer of the universe), make my mind to give up other thoughts and discipline it, so as to think of You alone.

Alavandar says that he is surrounded by passion and inertia. He is guilty of singing praises, which are not coming from the heart. He uses the words "false praise" (chadma stuti). He wants them to be taken at their face value (that is make it the base or authority, "avalambya api") and the redemptive grace of the Lord extended to him, so that his mind is disciplined ("me manah sikshaya").

Two points are spelt out in this sloka. One is that if the Lord is worshipped by non-sattvic people, their sins also will be washed away by the grace of the Lord. The second point that is made is that if the name of the Lord is repeated, even casually or facetiously, the sins would get obliterated. The second of the above two points is clearly borne out by the story of Ajamila, given in the Srimad Bhagavatam. The Bhagavatam tells us that the efficacy of the Name, which a man obtains by abstract meditation in the Krita Age, by sacrifice in the Treta Age, by adoration in the Dvapara Age, he obtains in the Kali Age by reciting the names of Narayana. Slokas 23 and 24 of Mukunda Mala need to be recalled in this context. Says Kulasekhara: 84 Sri Yamunacharya's "The holy formula of Sri Krishna is an unparalleled mantra to cut off everything hostile to one's good. It is the sum total of the mantras consisting of the sacred Upanishadic statements. It is the mantra which rescues one from "samsara". It is the mantra that expels the mass of accumulated darkness. It is the only mantra for the attainment of complete Lordship. It is the mantra that completely delivers those who are bitten by the snake of addiction to passions. O my tongue, always chant this Mantra, so that you may attain the fruition of your life". (Sloka 23) "The medicine in the form of the divine name of Sri Krishna cures ignorance and discrimination. It inspires sages to engage their minds in meditation and it torments the demons. It is the medicine for restoring the three worlds to life and for bestowing unlimited blessings on the devotees of the Supreme Lord. Indeed, it is the only medicine that can destroy one's fear of material existence and lead one to the attainment of supreme good". (Sloka 24) Alavandar prays for the mind being penalized ("shikshaya") or disciplined. What is this disciplining which is spoken of here? Having said that the utterings have not come from the heart, the obvious prayer is that there should be no duplicity in the supplication. The related offshoot is that the mind should be disciplined so that the thoughts are centred only on the Lord.

The Lord is addressed as "Dharanidhara". He is the Sustainer of the Earth. He absorbs all the sins and absolves the true seeker. One should recall the episode in the Srimad Bhagavatam. Mother Earth complains to the Lord that she is unable to bear the weight of the sinners, as they have increased greatly in numbers. The Lord assures her that He will manifest Himself to rid the earth of the sinners. The Lord bears all this weight. One should also recall the Varaha Avatara. The Lord playfully held up the earth, as if it was a ball to be played with by Him.

पिता त्वं माता त्वं दयिततनयस्त्वं प्रियसुहृत् verder zai fazi yoefer nfagenfer smarg | त्वदीयस्त्वद् भृत्यस्तव परजिनस्त्वद्गतिरहं प्रपन्नश्चैवं सत्यहमपि तवैवास्मि हि भरः ॥ ६० ॥

85 Pitaa tvam maataa tvam dayita-tanasyas tvam priyasuhrit tvam eva, tvam mitram, gururasi gatischasi jagataam, tvadeeyas, tvad bhrityah tava parijanah tvadgatiraham prapannaschaivam satyahamapi tavaivaasmi hi bharah.

For all the worlds, You alone are the father, mother, the beloved son, the dear friend, the confidant, the preceptor and the sole refuge. I am Yours, Your servant, Your attendant and Your protectee who has sought Your refuge. The responsibility for my welfare rests solely on You.

In the previous sloka, Alavandar had said that he had composed the text which was "chadma stuti", that is, it had not come from the heart. That being the case, the Lord may well ask why he should take to heart the pleadings of Alavandar which had not come from his heart. Alavandar replies in this sloka that the relationship between the two of them cannot be pushed aside. The Lord is the father, the mother, the son, the friend, the confidant and the sole refuge. He (the hymnologist) is the servant, the attendant and the "prapanna" who has sought the Lord as the sole refuge. Hence the Lord has to save him ("bharah asmi hi".) In this connection, one may recall sloka (5). While paying obeisance to the effulgent feet of Nammalwar, Alavandar had said that the feet constitute to all Vaishnavites at all times "..the aggregate of all worldly relations, such as mother, father, wife, sons, daughters and wealth in general".

In the sloka, two words are used which apparently look similar - "priya suhrut" and "mitram". We have translated them as confidant and a friend. There is a subtle difference between the two. A friend is one where the relationship is on a reciprocal basis while a confidant is one in whom we confide, a person who works for and helps one, without expecting any thing in return.

जनित्वाहं वंशे महति जगति ख्यातयशसां शुचीनां युक्तानां गुणपुरुषतत्त्वस्थितिविदाम् । निसर्गादेव त्वच्चरणकमलैकान्तमनसाम् अधोऽधः पापात्मा शरणद निमज्जामि तमसि ॥ ६१ ॥

306 86 Sri Yamunacharya's Janitvaaham vamse mahati jagati khyaata yasasaam sucheenaam yukṭaanaam guna-purusha tattva sthithividaam nisargaad eva tvat-charana-kamalaikaanta manasaam adho adhah paapaatmaa saranada! nimajjaami tamasi.

O refuge of all, though born in the exalted lineage of those of world renown, who are pure and ever abiding of You, who know the real nature of matter and spirit, who by their very nature have their minds solely devoted to Your lotus feet, I, being evil minded, am sinking deeper and deeper into the darkness of ignorance.

Thinking that the Lord may say that Alavandar is born in a good family, with a good lineage and that this is itself sufficient to attain the Lord, why then does he have to depend on the Lord? Alavandar replies that though he has an excellent lineage, he is a sinner. The poet describes the lineage - those of world renown ("jagati khyata"), those who are pure ("suchinam"), those who cannot bear to be separated from the Lord ("yuktanam"), those who know the qualities of matter and spirit ("guna purusha tattvasthiti vidam") and those who naturally have their minds devoted to the lotus feet of the Lord ("tvat charana kamala ekanta manasaam"). But then, he is a sinner. He is sinking into the darkness of ignorance. Since he is sinking deeper and deeper, into the abyss of 'tamas' called ignorance, the Lord, by His mercy has to redeem him.

Three descriptive phrases have been used to describe the worth of the lineage - those who are unable to bear separation from the Lord, those who know the difference between matter and spirit, and those who are devoted to the feet of the Lord. Alavandar thereby is referring to the Karma, Jnana and Bhakti Yoga knowledge of his ancestors.

This prayer of Alavandar to save him from sinking into the abyss of ignorance (samsara) is similar to sloka (34) in Mukunda Mala. Says Kulasekhara: "O Supreme Lord, Bhagavan, You are the most compassionate. So, please show me Your favour and bestow Your mercy upon 87 this helpless soul. You alone can lift me from the ocean of samsara into which I am sinking. O Lord Hari, You are verily the Purushottama, the Supreme Person! (Sloka 34) अमर्यादः क्षुद्रश्चलमतिरसूयाप्रसवभूः कृतघ्नो दुर्गानी स्मरपरवशो वञ्चनपरः । नृशंसः पापिष्ठः कथमहमितो दुःखजलधेः Gruırıgnhukma aftatai arurat: 11 &2 11 Amaryaadah kshudrah chalamatir asooyaaprasavabhooh kritaghno durmaani smaraparavaso vanchanaparah Nrisamsah paapisthah katham aham ito duhkhajaladheh Apaaraad utteernas tava parichareyam charanayoh.

I have been a transgressor (of the Sastras), an evil person, fickle minded, the home for envy, lascivious, deceitful, cruel and most wicked. How may I, crossing the boundless sea of misery, serve Your lotus feet? In the previous sloka, the word "paapaatma" had been used. Alavandar now elaborates all the bad qualities he is guilty of having in himself. He is a 1) heretic having no respect for scriptural injunctions (amaryadah) 2) an evil person ("kshudrah"), 3) a person with an unstable mind ("chalamatih"), meaning one who does not think of sastras, 4) the home for jealousy ("asuya prasavabhuh"), 5) one who forgets the good done to him, one who is ungrateful ("kritaghnah"), 6) one who is arrogant (durmaani), 7) one who is a slave to cupid ("smara paravasah"), 8) a deceitful person ("vanchanaparah"), 9) a cruel person (nrisamsah) 10) a wicked person ("papishthah"). He wants to know how he should get ashore from this unfathomable and boundless ocean of miseries and serve the Lord's feet? One must record here that once Sri Parasara Bhattar recited this sloka in the shrine of Ranganatha at Srirangam and said that he was in the same position as the hymnographer. There was a Vaishnava, a contemporary of Parasara Bhattar, who was jealous of the growing popularity of Bhattar and his own declining popular88 Sri Yamunacharya's ity. He was present in the shrine at the same time. Out of jealousy he burst out that Bhattar was not only guilty of the above sins, but that he was guilty of several more. All present there were shocked. Parasara Bhattar completed his worship and presented his gold ring to the jealous Vaishnava after covering him with a shawl. The Vaishnava was ashamed and nonplussed. Bhattar said that he was grateful to the Vaishnava for opening his (Bhattar's) eyes to the several sins about which he was not aware of himself. So great was the humility of Bhattar. It was this sloka which Bhattar had recited. Actually, Alavandar is not even remotely guilty of the above deficiencies. This sloka is intended for a majority of us and we are expected to recite it, with humility, before the Lord and purge ourselves of our sins.

Self-deprecation while worshipping the Lord is a common device used by the great Vaishnavite hymnographers. We had, in this work, quoted several such slokas from the works of Sri Vedanta Desika. We will quote two more. Says Desika in Saranagati Dipika: "Though I am more sinful than a hundred Ravanas put together, I have understood the declarations made by You on the seashore and on Arjuna's chariot, that You would offer refuge to all beings. So I realize that You have offered protection to me, for Your own sake."(Sloka 53).

"After making me say these unique and unvolitional words "I am yours, I have to be protected by you", You should not, like others, stand helplessly before Your queens, with Your virtues, overcome by my sins...."(Sloka 54).

रघुवर यदभूस्त्वं तादृशो वायसस्य प्रणत इति दयालुर्यच्च चैद्यस्य कृष्णा ।

प्रतिभवमपराद्भुर्मुग्ध सायुज्यदोऽभूः 'वद किमपदमागस्तस्य तेऽस्ति क्षमायाः ॥ ६३ ॥

Raghuvara yad abhoostvam taadriso vaayasasya pranata iti dayaalur yacha chaidyasya krishna! Pratibhavam aparaaddhur mugdha! saayujyado abhooh Vada kim apadamaa-agas tasya te asti ksmaayaah.

69 89 O Lord, as Raghuvara, you were compassionate to Kakasura, merely because he had sought You, though he had committed a transgression which could not be tolerated. As Sri Krishna, you had pardoned Sisupala, and granted him the Supreme bliss of attaining You, despite his having wronged You, birth after birth. So then, tell me, whether there is any crime, which is excluded from the scope of Your clemency? In the previous sloka Alavandar had said that he is the worst sinner. Lest the Lord ask him as to how he, a transgressor hopes to be redeemed, Alavandar reminds the Lord of the episode of Kakasura and of the episode of Sisupala, to remind the Lord that transgressors have all been redeemed by the Lord. He asks the Lord what transgression is there that the Lord will not forgive ("kshamayah apdam agah kim asti")? The story of Kakasura, the crow, is well known. It appears in the Sundara Kanda of the Ramayana. Hanuman has seen and conversed with Sita. He asks for a token so that he would be able to convince Rama that it was indeed Sita he had seen. Sita gives a jewel as a token of remembrance and additionally recounts the story relating to the pardon of Kakasura, which incident is known only to Rama and Sita. Sita was resting on the lap of Rama, when a crow made a bold attack on her. Rama woke up and angry as a five headed cobra saw the bloodstained talons of the crow. He released the Brahma astra against the crow. The crow circumambulated the world, but the arrow pursued it. None could save the crow. On the advice of Brahma, the crow sought the ref uge of Lord Ramachandra and sought forgiveness. The Lord, in His compassion granted life to the crow, but took away its eye, as the Brahmastra cannot be rendered ineffective. Hence, even the transgressor who had directly transgressed and committed an 'apachara' against the Lord, when he approaches Him and seeks His grace, the Lord will grant the grace.

The episode of Sisupala is well known. It is chronicled in the Srimad Bhagavatham. Jaya and Vijaya, the attendants of the 90 Sri Yamunacharya's Lord, at Vaikuntha, had prevented the Kumaras from having an audience with Lord Vishnu. The sages cursed them that they should eternally be asuras, after being born in the world. On the intervention of the Lord, the curse was modified. They were to be born as asuras, but thrice and in all the births they were to meet their death at the hands of the Lord. Though they were in constant conflict with the Lord, in each birth, their thoughts were always centred on the Lord. In succession they were born as Hiranyakasipu and Hiranyaksha, Ravana and Kumbhakarna, Sisupala and Dantavaktra. In all the cases, they were killed by the Lord. The manner of death of Sisupala was as follows. In a Rajasuya Yaga conducted by Yudhishthira, all the kings including Krishna, from Dwaraka, had been invited. A question arose, as to whom 'agrapuja' was to be done. Sahadeva suggested that it should be done to Krishna, who had stood by the Pandavas and was a respected elder statesman. Sisupala opposed this and made contemptuous remarks against Krishna, both because of past enmity and because of jealousy. When, in addition to the abusive speech, Sisupala sought to attack Krishna, the Lord beheaded Sisupala with his disc. Says the Bhagavatham (Skanda X Chapter 74) "while all the world looked on, a centre of brilliance, coming out of the dead body of Sisupala, was found to reach Krishna and get absorbed in him, like a meteor falling on the earth. Continously communing in confrontation with the Lord as his enemy, during three births, he attained to his being. For, continuous contemplation turns one into the nature of one contemplated upon....." It is to these two episodes that Alavandar makes a reference and states that there is no transgression that the Lord will not forgive - one has to turn to Him with concentration. He then becomes the refuge.

ननु प्रपन्नः सकृदेव नाथ तवाहमस्मीति च याचमानः ।

तवानुकम्प्यः स्मरतः प्रतिज्ञां मदेकवर्जं किमिदं व्रतं ते ॥ ६४ ॥

Nanu prasannah sakrudeva naatha! Tavaahamasmeeti cha yaachamaanah Tavaanukampyah smaratah pratijnaam Madekavarjam kimidam vratam te.

91 16 I have sought Your refuge. You had promised that if one surrenders but once to You, You will protect that person. I have also done so. Does your promise exclude me? Since Alavandar had, in the previous sloka, made specific reference to the episodes of Kakasura and Sisupala, the Lord may state that the grace of redemption is only extended on individual - specific basis and is certainly not applicable on a general basis. Alavandar therefore states in this sloka that he is a "prapanna", and he had sought the refuge of the Lord. He reminds the Lord that he has made a vow ("pratijnam") that if a person surrenders but once ("sakrudeva") to the Lord, He would protect the person. Alavandar says that he has also sought the grace. Does the vow ("vratam") of the Lord exclude him alone ("mad ekavarjam kim")? One should recall here the episode of Vibheeshana in the Ramayana. After Hanuman leaves Lanka in a shambles, setting fire to half the city, Ravana calls for a meeting of his counsellors. Vibheeshana gives wholesome advice. He asks Ravana to sue for peace and return Vaidehi. Ravana treats him with contempt. Vibheeshana with four of his followers goes to Lord Ramachandra and seeks his refuge. Angada, Sugriva and others suggest that Vibheeshana should be imprisoned and not given refuge. Rama quotes scriptures and citing Sage Kanva says "...In the name of humanity, one should not strike even an enemy who has arrived at one's door and is piteously soliciting protection with joined palms. Even an enemy who has come for protection should be protected, even at the cost of one's life. If from fear or folly or even from desire, a man does not justly protect a refugee according to his capacity, the sin incurred by him is despised in the world..." Lord Ramachandra gives refuge to Vibheeshana.

The hymnologist has this episode in mind and therefore says that if a person surrenders but once to the Lord, the Lord has 92 Sri Yamunacharya's extended His protection. The Lord may well say that this was individual-specific, that this was made applicable to Vibheeshana only and how does he expect it to be extended to him? Alavandar has in mind Lord Ramachandra's statement that even if Ravana were to seek his refuge, he would make it available. That is why Alavandar asks, am I alone excluded ("mat ekavarjam kim")? In this sloka, the words used are "...if one surrenders but once to you..." We do not wish to go into a religious discussion as to whether a 'prapanna' should do 'saranagati' only once or again and again. We will leave it to the Vaishnavite theologians to discuss this. We will, however, quote one sloka from 'Daya Satakam". Says Desika, "The Lord of Vrishachala does not abandon you even in anger, like the ocean which does not lose the quality of coolness, even after being heated. O Daya, You do not like Prapatti done a second time. Please touch me with the sporting lotuses, that is, the glances of the Lord". (Sloka 98).

We have quoted several slokas of Desika on the subject of 'Prapatti', 'Saranagati', during the course of this work. We will quote two more slokas from Saranagati Dipika. Says Desika: "O Lord, long ago you yourself truly said that compassion to those who seek refuge is the highest virtue. Because You are the one who gives refuge, You are now being reminded by me. Indeed, these undertakings of Yours are meant for people like me, is it not? (Sloka 45) "O Lord, Your forgiveness which was established as true in the case of Kakasura, Siva and others and which always devours the sins of those who try to say 'protect me' should not exclude me among beings" (Sloka 46) अकृत्रिमत्वच्चरणारविन्दप्रेमप्रकर्षावधिमात्मवन्तम् ।

पितामहं नाथमुनिं विलोक्य प्रसीद मद्वृत्तमचिन्तयित्वा ।। ६५ ।।

Akritrima tvachcharanaaravinda - prema-prakarshaavadhim aatmavantam93 pitaamaham Naathamunim vilokya praseeda madvrittam achintayitvaa.

Keeping in view the pure and guileless love of supreme devotion to your lotus feet by my grand father Nathamuni, the truly enlightened one, at least for his sake, please bless me, overlooking all my lapses and shortcomings.

In the first three slokas, obeisance had been offered to Nathamuni. In the last sloka, again a reference is being made. Alavandar says that the devotion displayed by Nathamuni is pure and gentle. It is abiding, unlike in the case of Alavandar. In sloka (62) Alavandar had submitted that he is fickle minded. His devotion may therefore not be constant and abiding. Alavandar pleads that atleast for the sake of Nathamuni, he has to be blessed without looking at his shortcomings. He says, without looking at his conduct (mad vrittam achintayitva), to please accept him ('praseeda').

This sloka underscores the fact that service to the feet of the Acharya is a sure pathway to liberation.

Conclusion: The Stotra Ratna, the hymn of 65 slokas, is a bench mark in Vaishnavite literature. It greatly influenced Bhagavan Ramanuja. This stotra brings out the essential teaching that the Lord is the means, the end and the goal of human endeavour. It also brings out the significance of the Dvayamantra. The sloka brings out clearly the efficacy of 'prapatti' in attaining liberation. The supremacy of Lord Vishnu is highlighted in many a verse, including indicating how the entire universe evolves out of him and is absorbed by him. The sovereignty of the Lord is impressed on us by highlighting His compassion, His beatific form and His eternally benevolent activities. This hymn is the centre piece of the concept of the Supreme Being and the concept of Surrender to him.

"Alavandar Thiruvadigale Saranam" T.T.D. Religious Publications Series No.593 Price: Rs. 15/"Stotra Ratna" of Sri Yamunacharya is a very rare jewel among devotional poems. This exquisite poem of 65 slokas contains the essence of the Visishatadvaita philosophy. Sri Yamunacharya, also known as Alavandar, elucidates the fundamental concepts regarding God and the soul and describes the qualities of the Lord and His unparalleled glory. Above all, this splendid stotra sets forth the concept of prapatti or wholehearted surrender to Lord Sriman Narayana most appealingly and authentically.
