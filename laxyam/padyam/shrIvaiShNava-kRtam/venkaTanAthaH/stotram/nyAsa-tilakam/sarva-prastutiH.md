The salutation in the form of the utterance of “nama:” sabdham is made first to our immediate AchAryAs and then to the AchAryAs of their AchAryAs in an ascending order all the way up to our PrathamAcharyan, Sriman nArAyaNan. 

In this hierarchy of AchAryAs, adiyEn reaches out to the Divine couple, the Lord and Lakshmi, as the First preceptor pair as the upAyam \(means\) and UpEyam \(goal\). Here, Swamy Desikan emphasizes the cardinal doctrine of VisishtAdhvaitham, where the Jeevan’s link is direct and unbroken from the Prakrutham \(current\) AchAryan to the First AchAryan, Sriman Narayanan. 

The first slOkam is an Acharya Vandhanam. A reverential salutation is made to the prakrutham AchAryan and to his AchArya Parampara \(namO vaakam adheemahE\).

“Gurubhya: namO vaakam adheemahE” is the starting salutation to one’s current AchAryans. We can have our current AchAryan or as in the case of AchArya Ramanuja more than one AchAryan at the same time. Ramanuja had five AchAryans and learnt different aspects of the Darsanam from them.

Because of the possibility of more than one AchAryan, Swamy Desikan uses the plural here: “Gurubhya: namO vaakam adheemahE”. The words “namO Vaakam” means namO vachanam \(the utterance of namO sabdham\). After offering namskaraNams to the current AchAryan\(s\), the next series of salutations is directed at the AchAryans of the current AchAryan\(s\) in an ascending order \(tat grubhyascca namO vaakam adheemahE\). The word “adheemahE” means

“adhyayanam kurmahE” \(engage in respectful recitation of their taniyans\). Our AchAryAs feed us with the milk of j~nAna about the correct meanings of the three Tathvam’s and the three Rahasyams and ensure our upliftment from the samsAric sorrows. That is why we utter many times the nama: sabdham in grateful appreciation of their MahOpakAram.

**Adhi dampathi -thirukkadalmallai **

The second Padham declares: “Adyau jagatAm patee dampatee vruNeemahE ca”. 

Swamy Desikan offers his namO vachanam now to the Aadhi dampathi \(Lord and Lakshmi as the first couple/Prathama dampathees\). He points out that this Aadhi dampathi is an eternal mithunam \(couple\), who rule over all the worlds as yEka sEshis. Dampathi here stands for an eternal dual \(dhvi Vachanam\) without singular 12 





or plural forms. The divine couple rule as One. Neither Narayana nor Lakshmi alone is “the ultimate godhead”, but both of them together, as a dampathi are the embodiment of the tatthvam, Hitham and the PurushArtham. In the subsequent slOkams of nyAsa tilakam, Swamy Desikan is going to elaborate later on these doctrines \(“dhivya dampathi is tatthwa, SaraNya dampathi is hithA/upAya and Seshi dampathi, the PurushArtha”\). 

Swamy Desikan emphasizes the need for “Guru ParamparA prakAsanam” \(the glorification of the AchArya vamsam\). That celebration has to start with the salutation to one’s AchAryan \(Svaacharyam Arabhya\) and those salutations should ascend up to the PrathamAchAryan \(Bhagavath paryantham Guru Paramparaa anusanthAnam\). This first slOkam is a famous slOkam that is recited at the beginning of all Vaidhika Karmaas.

This second slOkam explains the significance and symbolism of the right hand of Sri Ranganatha displaying the abhaya Mudra, a gesture that assures freedom form fear for the chetanas, who have sought refuge at his holy feet. 

Although the other slOkas of this master piece cover significant doctrines related to Prapatthi and the post-Prapatthi life of a Prapanna, this particular slOkam dealing with the abhaya hastham of the Lord of Srirangam 

“mesmerizes” adiyEn. 

The slOkam is a very moving slOkam and so comforting and reassuring that each time we stand before Sri Ranganatha that we should remind ourselves about the deep meaning of this verse and the profound message it carries. 

**Commentary**

Swami prays for the protection of the right hand holding the abhaya Mudhraa. 

\(SrIranga bhartu: hasta: maam avyaat\). Why this special attention to the right hand and the Abhaya gesture seen there? 

Swami Desikan suggests in the way of utprEksha alankaaram \(poetic fancy\) that the Abhaya Pradhaana gesture symbolizes Lord’s “prohibition”" against repeating the act of Prapatthi since he has already assured that seeking refuge ONCE at his lotus feet will be sufficient to receive His unfailing 14 





protection \(Sakrudheva Prapannaaya tavaasmithi ca yaachathe, abhayam Sarva bhoothebhyO dhadhaamyetath vratham mama\). 

Swami suggests that the abhaya Mudra appears like the Lord’s command to the Prapanna to stop repeating the performance of Prapatthi. His abhaya Mudra appears like it is saying, “Halt, Cease doing another Prapatthi\! Enough. I will protect you for the Prapatthi that you have performed already”. 

Sri D. Ramaswamy Iyengar reminds us of what great Acharyas tell their disciples at the time of Prapatthi. They say: “Now that you have become a Prapanna, fix your gaze hence forth on the abhaya Mudra of the Lord and derive comfort and solace from the way it promises protection from hereon”. 

Here we are reminded by the spirit of the two halves of the Charama slOka. In the first half \(maamekam Saranam vraja\), the Lord invites the Prapannas to seek refuge at his sacred feet; in the second half, He states unequivocally 

“maa Sucha:”, and gives us hope and courage stating “do not grieve any more”. 

The message then is to rely on Lord’s charanaaravindham \(lotus feet\) until Prapatthi and thereafter shift our focus to the Abhaya Mudra and the message it carries. 



Moved by this profound message housed in this slOkam, Swami Desikan used it 

“in toto” as the second verse of his manipravaaLa work abhaya Pradhana Saara, which extols the SaraNaagathi SaastrA aspects of Srimad RamaayaNam. Once again, Swami Desikan included this message in his Tamil work adaikkala Patthu. 

Here, Swami was moved by the sight of the abhaya Hastham of Lord Varadaraja of Kanchi and said \(adaikala pattu, paasuram 7\): umtFkqAdki\[fEbe\[\[fB oRkaLArtftvAr 

Àmy<mi\[iey\[fpvafEpalf \`wfcel\[kfkrmfAvtfT 

"umathadigalai adaihinrehn yenru orukkaal uraitthavarai amaiyum ini yenbavar pOl anjal yena karam vaitthu” 

The Prapanna’s statement during Prapatthi is “umathu adigalai adaihinrEn \(I seek refuge at your holy feet as my means for Moksham\). The Prapanna states once \(Orukkaal uraithavarai\) that he sought refuge under the cool shade of the Lord’s lotus feet. The Lord responds with the abahya Mudra and seems to indicate enough, it is enough that you asked My protection once \(amaiyum ini yenbavar pol anjal yena karam vaitthu\).

This then is the message of the abhaya Hastham of the SaraNaagatha Rakshaka KaaruNeekan, Sriman NaarayaNan.

Our Samsaric Ocean is without beginning and end. Same is the situation with our ocean of sins that we have accumulated. How can we hope to dry them up?

Prapatthi is one of the two ways to succeed in this effort. Our PoorvAchAryAs have demonstrated the efficacy of this route. Sriman Narayana in His incarnations as Raama and KrishNa have assured us that They will offer us their unfailing protection against the misery of being caught up in the endless cycles of births and deaths. They have unequivocally stated that they will never abandon one who has sought Their refuge through the performance of SaraNAgathy at Their feet. Our AchAryAs have pointed out that our Prapatthi to the Lord has to be preceded by PurushakAra Prapatthi to MahA Lakshmi. Our AchAryAs have instructed us that the most merciful MahA Lakshmi will intercede on our behalf, persuade Her Lord to be sympathetic to our prayer for protection and assure the success of our Prapatthi. She is our sympathetic Mother, who takes pity on our sufferings in the samsaric world 18





and appeals successfully to Her Lord to bless us with the fruits of Prapatthi.

Her Lord is angry over our trespasses against His Saasthrams and is ready to use His nigraha sakthi \(power of punishment\); Our Mother intervenes, pleads with Her Lord to overlook our trespasses and to use His anugraha sakthi instead of nigraha sakthi. Our Lord can not refuse His principal consort’s appeal and we become the beneficiaries of Her Lord’s protection.

**Commentary**

AR :

KumAra VaradAchAr points out that the purport of this slOkam is: PurushakAra Prapatthi to MahA Lakshmi should precede our Prapatthi to Her Lord. The SamsAram is without beginning \(anAdhi\) and endless \(nissemna:\). To the accumulated bundles of sins from previous janmAs, we keep on adding more and enter the samsAric cycle again and again with no hope of release from this treadmill of suffering. Lord Ramachandran and BhagavAn KrishNa have assured through their charama slOkams about Prapatthi yOgam as the sure means to gain their unfailing protection:

sakrutEva prapannAya tavAsmeeti yaachatE



abhayam sarvabhUtEbhyO dadhAmi yEtat vratam mama

---Lord Ramachandra in Srimath RaamAyaNam Sarva dharmAn parityjya maamEkam SaraNam vraja |

aham tvaa sarva paapEbhyO mOkshayishyAmi maa suca: ||

---Lord KrishNa in Bhagavath Geethai

After comforting oneself with the Lord’s assurances, one should initiate SaraNaagathy at the Lord’s Sacred feet. Prior to that, we have to follow the command of MahA Lakshmi about approaching Her Lord to remove Her Lord’s anger over the jeevan’s trespasses:

19





“maamEkaam dEvadEvasya mahisheem SaraNam sryEth”. We perform the SaraNaagathy at the sacred feet of our Mother first and with Her sipArsu, approach the Lord to perform SaraNaagathy in the form of PrAyascchittham. If there is no PurushakAra Prapatthi, Bhagavath Prapatthi won’t succeed.

PurushakAra Prapatthi is for removing the nigraha sankalpam of the Lord \(jananee pithruthva yuktha dhaNDadharathva nivAraNAya, purushakAri bhavathi --Kumara VaradAchAr\).

Swamy Desikan uses three examples to remind us that PirAtti is upAyam \(means\) during SaraNaagathi to Her Lord. Her role does not conclude with being PurushakAra BhUthai. She is also upAya bhUthai. It is not correct to view Her role in “upAya portfolio is a mark or upalakshaNa”. When we approach the Lord as upAya for Moksha siddhi, His consort, MahA Lakshmi is also included. Our refuge is in the couple and not in VishNu alone. 

In PraNavam based BharanyAsam, we use the word “aum”, “A" \(a\) stands for the Lord, "%" \(u\) stands for MahA Lakshmi and “m" \(m\) represents the Jeevan that surrenders. All the three go together and cannot be separated. In the Prapatthi anushtAnam through the dhvaya mantram, PirAtti stays as ViSEshaNam and becomes direct means for MOksham \(SaakshAth MokshOpAyam\). In the Aathma samarpaNa Yaj~nam, both the Lord and His 21 





PirAtti are both the means \(uddhEsyathvam\) and Goal \(PrApyam\).

I who has no other protection, seek refuge in Lakshmi with the cool glances \(rejuvenating katAkshams\). She removes the inaccessibility of Her Lord to the Jeevans and facilitates His accessibility to them at the time of seeking Him as upAyam. She has not only Her role as a PurushakAra bhuthai but She has anvayam \(union\) with Her Lord during the upAya dasai as well. She has SaakshAth upAyathvam \(direct means\) and has anvayam with her Lord during the upAya dasai. She is inseparably present with Her Lord during the time of Prapatthi of the Jeevan \(PrapattavyE tattvE pariNamita vaisishTya vibhavAm\). 

The Prapatthi is made to both of Them together. They are inseparable “like VisEshaNa \(adjectival attributes\) and VisEshya \(noun, object designated by the attribute\)". Like the Vedic words MahEndra, agnAvishNu which are used as one unit, instead of two separate words \(“Mahaa\+Indhra and Agni\+VishNu”\), we have to perform Prapatthi to Sriman-Narayana together as a Mithunam \(Couple\). It is for this reason Dhvaya Mantram refers to both the Lord and SrI together, when it states “Sriman Narayana CharaNou SaraNam PrapadhyE”. I who has no other refuge take refuge in Sri Devi \(Sriyam aham SaraNam yaami\). 

**Commentary**

AR : 

SrI Devi has her role as PurushakAra BhUthai. She recommends our case and pleads with Him to overlook our wilful trespasses \(chithai:upAyai: vismArya/

She makes Him forget our bundles of sins thru appropriate means\). As the Mother with the name of SrI dEvi, She helps us in six different ways: 1. She is sought after as refuge \(SreeyathE\); 2. She seeks the Lord for our protection \( SrayathE\); 3. She listens to our plaintive cries \(SruNOthi\); 4. She makes the Lord listen to us \( SrAvayathi\); 5. She dispels our difficulties \(SruNAthi\) and 23 





6. She makes us fit \(SreeNAthi\) to receive Her Lord’s grace. 

In addition to pleading for us \(PurushakArathvam\), She has also the power to be the direct upAyam \(means\) for SaraNAgathi. In the preceding slOkam, Swamy Desikan referred to the first step at the beginning of the performance of one’s saraNaagathi \(PurushakAra Prapatthi\): ”akhilanNaathasya mahisheem Sriyam PrapathyE” . In this slOkam, Swamy Desikan performs SaraNaagathi to SrI Devi as SaakshAth upAyam \(direct means\). 

PirAtti has three attributes \(AakArams\) as AakAra traya sampannai: 1. Displaying PurushakAram 

2. Being SaakshAth upAyam and 



3. Being PrApyam/Phalan of Prapatthi

sadagopan.org





–according to NadAthUr AmmAL 

She is: 

1. PurushakAra BhUthai for the jeevans with sins before they approach Her Lord as refuge 

2. During the upAya dasai, She is with Him to enhance His VaathsalyAdhi guNams 

3. During the Praapya dasai, She is there with Him and enhances His Jn~Ana sakthi. 

Swamy Alavanthar points out in his third slOkam of ChathusslOki that one attains the sought after phalans of Iswaryam, Kaivalyam and Moksham through SaraNaagathi to Sri Devi; Swamy Desikan in his commentary on this slOkam elaborates with various pramANams that Sri Devi grants us all the four PurushArthams \(Dharma, artha, Kaama MOksham\). KurEsar has stated clearly 24
at the beginning of his Sri Sthavam “Svasthi Sreer diSathAth" \(The Lord with Her help performs creation, protection and destruction of the universe and its beings as well as granting the jeevans Svargam, narakam or Moksham\). 

Swami PiLLai LokAcchAr has stated in Sri Vachana BhUshaNam that the Lord has no Rakshakathvam and Seshithvam without Sri Devi \(Rakshakathva SeshithvangaL Lakshmi VyathikaraNE ILLAI\). Nanjeeyar in his Sri Sookthi BhAshyam has emphasized Her upAyathvam along with PurushakArathvam this way: 

“Sriyam-PurushakArathvEna upAyathvEna aAasreeyamANAm”. Udayavar reminded us: “EmperumAnai sonna idatthilE, PirAttiyayum solliRRAm” ** **\(whenever the Lord is mentioned, His Piratti is also included\). 

sadagopan.org

Srutha PrakAsa AchAryan in his SaraNaagathy vyAkhyAnam states: It is the PoorvAchAryA’s position that we should perform PurushakAra Prapatthi at the sannidhi of Lakshmi and follow it up with a prayer for Her to be UpAyam for the PurushArtham of Moksham with the help of the Moola Mantram \(PurushArtha PrArtanam\) and after getting Her permission utter dhavya mantram for being blessed with the phalan of Moksham. PurushakAra Prapatthi is done first and then Parama PaurushArtha PrArtanam is done. The conclusion is that SrI Devi is not an upalakshaNm, but stands as VisEshaNam and thereby becomes direct upAyam for Moksham. Dhivya dampathis are upAyam and not PerumAl alone. She is ajn~Atha nigrahai \(she does not know what is punishment\). Swamy Desikan says in this context that as aSaraNan \(one without any protection\), he seeks Her out as upAyam \(Sriyam aSaraNa: aham SaraNam yaami \).

Unlike the other Jeevans, ParamAthmA is self-manifested. He has no births. 

He is recognized as SiddhOpAyam since He stands as an eternal upAyam without us performing any upAyam. He displays limitless auspicious attributes. 

He never leaves the side of Periya PirAtti. Out of His compassion, He creates all jeevans including Brahma Devan. After creating Brahma dEvan, He instructs him on the Vedaas. Brahman follows the Vedic instructions to create the other jeevans. Our Lord stays as the sole Master of all the created jeevans. To enjoy the Lord of the Universe thoroughly, one has to practise Prapatthi or Bhakthi yOgam. Prapatthi yOgam is the direct means to moksham. Bhakthi yOgam is difficult for us to practice. It takes a long time to bear fruit. Hence, adiyEn is unfit to choose Bhakthi yOgam for Moksha Siddhi. Therefore, adiyEn performs SaraNaagathy \(Prapatthi\) at the Lord’s sacred feet \(tam dEvEsam mumukshu: aham SaraNam adhigacchAmi\). 

27 





**Commentary**

AR : 

Swamy Desikan performs SaraNaagathi here in the way shown by the Veda mantram of SvEtaswathAra Upanishad: 

yO brahmAnam vidhadhAthi poorvam 

yO vai VedhAmsccha prahiNothi tasmai 

tamm ha dEvAthma–buddhiprasAdham 

mumukshurvai SaraNamaham prapadhyE 

The meaning of the mantram is: adiyEn aspiring for Moksham \(Mumukshu\) seek refuge \(SaraNam aham prapadhyE\) in that resplendent Lord, who creates Brahma first and blesses him with the vedAs also; my intellect shines on account of this effulgent Lord. 

KumAra VaradAchar Swamy quotes the above mantram and points out that this slOkam reveals the meaning of the Sruthi Vaakyam \(ithi Sruthi siddham artham prakaTayan\). It is clear that the words and the sentiments of this mantram are tightly integrated into this slOkam by Swamy Desikan. Sri D. 

Ramaswamy IyengAr gives a nice analysis of the overlap of this Upanishad mantram with the passages of the slOkam this way: 

"The first half of this slOkam refers to: 1. the Lord’s self-evident nature \(i.e.\), ever existing on His own 2. Srimathvam, ever associated with Lakshmi in nithya yOgam or eternal union 

3. KalyANa guNaakarathvam, possession of all auspicious guNams 4. creation of Brahma in the first instance and through him the entire created cosmos as an act of grace\( karuNayaa\) and 5. revelation of the VedAs. 

The third quarter of this slOkam refers to Prapatthi as the only means for 28 





Moksham. For, the only other means, Bhakti Yoga has to depend on Prapatthi to get over several hurdles in its course. Readers will remember how the charama slOka has been interpreted only to refer to anga Prapatthi even by Ramanuja in his GeethA BhAshya. It was Desika who first incorporated the charama slOka as a self sufficient and immediate means to Moksha in his Taathparya chandrikaa, a gloss on Ramanuja’s GeethA bhAshya, and also in the charama slOka adhikAra of Srimad Rahasya Thraya Saaram. In this slOkam, Desika refers to both those aspects of Prapatthi only to demonstrate the Lord is easy of approach \(sulabham\) only to those, who rely on Prapatthi either as a direct means or an adjunct to Bhakthi yoga. Having said so much about the Lord, who is the goal and about Prapatthi as the means, Desika does Prapatthi in the last Quarter of this slOka in the words of the Upanishad”.

This slOkam provides an answer to the question relating to the five roopams of the Lord: Param, VyUham, Vibhavam, antharyAmi and archai. Which of these five roopams is the best for observing Prapatthi is the question. Swamy Desikan points out that archaa roopam is the preferred one because of its Parathvam and Soulabhyam. In this context, Swamy Desikan blesses us with a slOkam to share the flood of his Aanandha anubhavam about the archaa Moorthy Sri RanganAthan. 

KumAra VaradAcchAr’s commentary on this slOkam is insightful: “Vaikunta sthaanE--asmadhAdhibhi: aasrayathum asakyathvAth asmadhAdaaSrayaNa-upayuktam soulabhyam Aasrithya parama kaaruNikO bhagavAn SrirangAdhi dhivya dEsEshu varthathE”. It is impossible for us to perform Prapatthi at Sri Vaikuntam with our gross sareeram and therefore, the most merciful Lord has made Himself available to us readily at dhivya dEsams like Srirangam. He rests 31 on His serpent bed at Srirangam with His athi-sundara roopam and enchants us. There at Srirangam, He rests “to capture us and we are intent on surrendering to Him”. 

Ramaswami Iyengar: 

“That Sriman, who was easily accessible to the hosts of the lovely damsels of Vraja \(Gokulam\) in the BrindhAvanam region, and made them compliant to Him, that Sriman who is a great seducer, is now reposing in His AdhisEsha couch at Rangam \(Srirangam\) with a view to seduce \(draw into Himself\) the entire race of mankind”. 

**Commentary**

When the Lord took the VibhavAvathAram of KrishNa, He enchanted the assembly of Gopis. He also protected that assembly of gopAs and gOpis \(Brundha\+avanam\). Our Lord was readily accessible to all the people and animals there. He became bhaktha sulabhan there. We missed being with Him at that time in BrundhAvanam and DhwArakai. To enchant us, who were not fortunate to be with Him then, our Lord is resting now at Srirangam on His AadhisEsha bed. As at BrundhAvanam in those days of His vibhava avathAram, today, Sri RanganAthan as archA Moorthy is waiting for our Prapatthi unto Him.

Our Lord and His Devi have these two attributes in abundance and hence are recognized as SarvalOka SaraNyAs and yEka SEshis. They are enjoying their sports of the creation, nurturing and dissolution of the universes \(Srushti, sthithi and avasaana\) as they sit comfortably on the expansive couch formed by 34 sthithi and avasaana\) as they sit comfortably on the expansive couch formed by the body of Their Adhi SEshan. The word SEshan stands for one “who subserves the end of another and exists only for the other”. In this context, Adhi SEshan has to be understood as the primordial, ancient SEshan engaged in serving his Lord and His Lady. Seated on their comfortable couch, the divine couple listen to the Veda vaakyams generated by their child in its not fully developed infant language \(mazhalai\). These Vedic words \(Om tat sat\) emanating from the child resting on the lotus cradle high above the naabhi of the Lord are full of meaning. Om is the prathama-aksharam uttered during recitation of the Vedam and recited at the beginning of all Vaidhika karmas. 

“tat” is uttered \(anusandhAnam\) in all karmas, where the phalan is not sought. 

That stands for the Supreme Brahman \(ParamAthmA\) and karma nivEdhanams to that Brahman in the spirit of Bhagavth preethi is marked by the word “tat”. The word “sat” is used in the instances of KarmAs, where some phalan or other is anticipated. “sat” is a Mangala sabdham. The divine parents instruct their first born child \(Brahma dEvan\) on these three meaningful words first \(aksharAbhyAsam\). Brahma dEvan takes the cue from his parents and spreads the message of Vedams and encourages the world to perform Vaidhika karmas. 

The divine parents hear this first attempt at speech by Their child and as proud parents, the SEshi-pair are filled with joy. Swamy Desikan recalls this precious scene and reminds us that this Divine Couple is the object of our Self-surrender \(SaraNaagathi\) \(dampathee na: pathee\). This nirupAdhika SEshis are the principal target for our Prapatthi \(Mukhya vishayam for our Prapatthi\).

Oh RanganAtha\! Dayaa nidhi\! Your katAksham is filled with the radiant bundles of the flood of deep compassion for us. They banish our sufferings. They are like the inerasable white paint that covers the blemish of the dense blackish soot that resulted from the fire of our sins. May those sorrow-removing, dayaa laden glances of Yours fall on us and quench our samsAric afflictions\! 

**Commentary**

AR : 

From here on, Swamy Desikan addresses Lord RanganAtha directly and prays for the compassion-filled glances of the Lord to fall on him \(ghana karuNaa nayana maha: chaTaam mayi tarangaya\). Swamy Desikan visualizes these dayaa-laden glances as unceasing waves and requests the Lord to drench him in those comforting waves. He describes his state as pitiable needing attention and recognizes the compassion-filled glances of the Lord will remove the 37 





sufferings from the samsAric afflictions \(paritApa harAm nayana maha: chaTaam\). Swamy Desikan compares the cleansing effect of those glances to the fresh and inerasable white paint that eliminates \(neutralizes\) the blemishes of the dark soot caused by the wild fire of his sins. Your karuNaa kataksham should fall on me and result in adiyEn performing SaraNaagathy at Your sacred feet. This is the prayer of Swamy Desikan in this slOkam. The dayaa-laden glances have been saluted in the other sthOthrams of Swamy Desikan: “dayaa bharithai: apAngai:” in Sri dehaLeesa Sthuthi and “dayaa tarangAnucharai: kaTaakshai:” in Sri HayagrIva SthOthram. Swamy Desikan prays in this slOkam for unending waves of the Lord’s KaruNA kaTaaAksham to drench him and remove the samsAric pain and sorrow. This slOkam is housed also in Sankalpa SooryOdhayam \(act VI, SlOkam 68\). 

Swamy KumAra VaradAcchAr points out that the paramount guNam of the SaraNyan is His KaruNai. Swamy Desikan has created hundred plus verses on this KaruNaa \(Dayaa\) guNam of the Lord in his Dayaa Sathakam. Therefore Swamy Desikan salutes here the SarvalOka SaraNyan as the One filled with Ghana KaruNaa. This dense flood of compassion is forever flowing attribute of our LORD. The prayer is: “Oh RangapathE\! asmath PathE\! tava ghana karuNaa kaTaaksham mayi nidhEhi\!”. May those waters of KaruNaa rasam drench adiyEn and cool me quickly from the taapams and the paritaapams of SamsAram\! The message of this slOkam is that the performance of MokshArtha Prapatthi is essential for a jeevan suffering from samsAric tApams.

Oh Lord of Thiruvarangam\! The MahOpakArams done by You to me are limitless. My dhushkarmaas are beyond count. They are fierce and not easy to get rid off. In spite of their negative impact, You have blessed me with human birth in a vaidheeka kulam. In spite of this birth in this srEshta kulam, adiyEn could have been deluded by avaidhika, Veda Baahya mathams. You saved adiyEn from falling as a prey to these Naasthika \(Vedam denying\) and Kudhrushti mathams that distort the true meanings of the VedAs for their own sake. You blessed adiyEn to become the sishyan of the great grandson AppuLLAr \(the 39 koLLu pEran\) of the MahAn, MadaipaLLI AacchAn, who imbibed all SaasthrArthams from Bhagavath RaamAnujaa Himself, while he served as the head of the kitchen serving Udayavar. Oh RanganAthA\! Up to this stage preceding adiyEn’s Prapatthi, You have blessed me with so many rare soubhAgyams. The residual responsibilities towards me are very little. That remaining upakAram that You have to bless me with is to accept adiyEn’s SaraNaagathi and lift me up to Your sacred feet at Your Supreme abode at Sri Vaikuntam and bless me to perform blemishless nithya kaimkaryam for You and Your Devi there. 







**Lift me up to your sacred feet **

**Commentary**

AR : 

In the preceding slOkams 6, 7 and 8, Swamy Desikan dealt with the Soulabhya, Swamithva and KaaruNya guNams of the Lord. In this slOkam, Swamy Desikan 40 expresses his Krutajn~athai \(gratefulness\) to the Lord for all the great upakArams performed by Him and reminds the Lord of Srirangam about the remaining “small” help for his protection. 

Swamy Desikan lists the four major upakArams of the Lord so far: 1. birth as a human being to follow Bhagavath Saasthrams, 2. freedom from the clutches of Veda Baahya mathams like ChArvAkam, Buddhism et al, 

3. freedom from the pull of Kudhrushti mathams that distort the true meanings of Vedam and 

4. blessings to be the sishyan of AppuLLAr, the great grandson of Kidambi AacchAn. 



Swamy Desikan now asks Lord RanganthA a question: Having done so much for me already, would not you please lead adiyEn along the remaining distance to Your sacred Thiruvadi? It won’t be difficult at all for you to confer on adiyEn this blessing. This then is the prayer for completion of the spiritual journey through the performance of Prapatthi at the Lord’s sacred feet. My Lord\! This would not be a great burden for You \(madh vishayE tava bhara: svalpAvasishTa:\). May adiyEn be blessed to ascend Parama padham via archirAdhi maargam at the end of this life and enjoy kaimkarya saamrAjyam there\!

<details><summary>English</summary>

The glories of Prapatthi are hailed in this slOkam. Bhakthi yOgam yields fruit after a long time. In between, one might have to take a few births. Vaidhika KarmAs are angams for Bhakthi yOgam and hence one might have to perform agni kaaryams like AgnihOthram. People of all varNAs are not eligible for practicing Bhakthi yOgam. It is a difficult task and the awareness of this approach creates a mingling of thoughts about the independence of the practitioner and the importance of Bhakthi yOgam. The practice of the Prapatthi yOgam to gain Moksham on the other hand is quite different: 42 


1. It is easy to practice   
2. It does not need any agni kAryam 
3. It grants Moksham immediately after Prapatthi for one, who can not bear the pains of samsAram any more 
4. It also permits one to engage in Bhagavath/BhAgavatha Kaimkaryam until the end of one’s time on earth and then leads to Moksham 
5. All are eligible; there is no varNaasrama limitations 6. There is no gender based restrictions 
7. The practitioner of Prapatthi yOgam is no longer the mukhya vishayam. Our Lord becomes instead the mukhya vishayam. 
8. The Lord becomes upAyam and Phalan in Prapatthi 
9. The Lord stands in the place of Bhakthi yOgam and our prayer in Prapatthi for Him to play that role because of our incapability to practise the arduous Bhakthi yOgam 
10. One abandons the thought that Prapatthi is a mukhya upAyam like the Lord and recognizes that Prapatthi is an upAyam to gain the Lord’s grace and it is only the Lord who empowers us to perform Prapatthi. 
11. Prapatthi unlike Bhakthi yOgam destroys even PrArabdha KarmAs. 

MEANING 

This Prapatthi yOgam will yield immediate phala for the Aarthan / Aartha Prapannan \(One does not want to stay a moment longer on this earth and wishes to start his nithya kaimkaryam to the Lord in Parama Padham right away\). For the Dhruptha Prapannan \(contented Prapannan\) who can wait until the end of his assigned life period, it grants Moksham at the time his body falls on ground. This Prapatthi yOgam does not require any agni kAryam like Bhakthi yOgam. It can be practised by members of all the varNams. It can be practiced by men and women. Prapannan recognizes that it is not the PradhAna upAyam but BhagavAn is the mukhya vishayam \(primary means/PradhAna 43 upAyam\). Prapatthi is a vyAja \(mere pretext to invoke the Lord’s sympathy in one’s favour\) and the Lord is the ancient SiddhOpAyan, who exists as the upAyam before Prapatthi. May this noble SaraNaagathi yOgam become fruitful to adiyEn\!

**avatArikA**: 

The glories of the SuddhAntha SiddhAnthis \(Sri RanganAtha pathivrathais\) are celebrated here as persons of emulation by the PrapannAs. 

**Meaning**

Oh RanganAthaa\! May those great souls, whose souls are entrusted by AchAryAs for protection by You, who identify themselves with You in thought, word and deed \(SuddhAntha SiddhAnthis\), whose mind are always gravitating 45 towards kaimkaryam to You, who delve deep in to Your anantha kalyANa guNAnubhavam, who like muktha jeevans have abandoned the idea of Yourself being upAyam anymore, who have developed an exquisite, innate ruchi, rasaa about being Thy devoted servants \(SEshans\) to You as the Sarva SEshi --May the thought of such muktha jeevans and nithya sooris be forever sweet to adiyEn’s mind\! 




**Commentary**

AR : 

In the previous slOkam, Sva nishtai performed by an eminently qualified adhikAri was covered. In this slOkam, AchArya nishtai is the subject matter. In this mode of performance of one’s Prapatthi, AchAryan performs the Bhara SamarpaNam on behalf of the Mumukshu \(One who desires Moksham\). After Prapatthi, they 46 become VisEsha abhimAna vishaya BhUthar \(special objects of abhimAnam\) for You and develop intense ruchi for Kaimkaryam to You and Your Devi and constantly enjoy reflections on Your anantha kalyANa guNams. All the other PrapannAs have You as their upAyam; AchArya nishtAs on the other hand consider their AchAryan as their upAyam and upEyam. Swamy ParAsara Bhattar says in this context \(AchArya nishtai\): “my burden was made Yours by the AchAryAs; and I too uttered the words spelling out SaraNaagathy”. The result is that adiyEn enjoys the fruits of Prapatthi and engage in AchArya and BhAgavatha Kaimkaryams. It is a blessed state to be\! Swamy Desikan states that he too wishes to enjoy that blessed state.

**avatArikA**: 

The mind set of PrapannAs in the post-Prapatthi period is the subject matter of this slOkam. The five angAs of Prapatthi are also referred to in this slOkam. 

**Meaning**

Oh RanganAthaa\! The prapannAs are of the firm conviction that they have no one else but You to protect them \(ananya gathi:\). They are “apAsta tvat itara gataya:”. They also are convinced that they do not have the power/sakthi to 48 seek any other upAyam other than Yourself to protect themselves \(Aakinchanyam\). Therefore, they will not seek any one except You as their refuge even after the passage of many kalpams. They have unshakable faith in You as their protector \(Mahaa ViswAsam\). They have immeasurable bhakthi for You \(bhakti bhoomnA\). They will not engage in any act that will displease You \(praathikoolya varjanam\). They will actively engage in kaimkaryams that will meet with Your MukhOllAsam \(aanukoolya sankalpam\).  
They will have utter faith in You as their unfailing Protector to display their gOpthruthva VaraNam \(trAtAram tvAm abhEdyAt SaraNa varaNata:\). Through the expression of their Aakinchanyathvam, they have displayed the angam of KaarpaNyam. They have abandoned any effort at their Aathma RakshaNam after placing the burden of protection at Your sacred feet even when they are eager to enjoy the fruits of their Prapatthi 49 
\(rabhasa jusha: api, tvat nikshipta Aatma rakshAm prati sva-pravruttim tyajanti\). They are PuNyasaalis. They place their Aathma rakshaa Bharam at the sacred feet of Yours. You have been waiting for them. All the karmas that stood as VirOdhis for Prapatthi are gone now. They have reached a state of eagerness to enjoy You at Parama padham. In spite of that heightened sense of anticipation, they do not engage in any effort to hasten this process after their Prapatthi anushtAnam and wait patiently for the Phalan with full faith in You. 

**Commentary**

AR : 

This is a slOkam to celebrate the mind set of SvanishtAs who believe firmly that Aathma Yaathrai is Bhagavadh adheenam and stay from any attempts at Sva-rakshaNam. For them, “sva-pravrutti nivrutti is Prapatthi” \(i.e.\), cessation from personal efforts at Sva-rakshaNam after Prapatthi lest their Prapatthi performed earlier would become null and void. The upadEsam of MokshArtha Prapatthi is done only once.

**avatArikA**: 

This slOkam focuses on the behaviour of PrapannAs, whose vow it is not trespass on Bhagavath Saasthrams. Our Lord’s commands are for the well being of all mankind \(akhila jana hitatA gOcarA\). PrapannAs, who have this code of conduct, are saluted as **“**Subha charithAn” \(people of blemishless and auspicious lives\). These PrapannAs turn a blind eye towards other gods. Such PrapannAs displaying Mahaa Viswaasam in Sriman NarayaNaa come under His exclusive Protection. 

51 

**Meaning**

“Oh RanganAthaa\! Thou who puts up with \(pardon\) every thing, doth protect those blessed and fortunate persons who have discarded all other means \(but Prapatthi\) and stayed away from all sinful deeds; if perchance they take to these sinful deeds, they get remorseful, and get cleansed by performing PrAyascchittha Prapatthi; they observe all dharmAs suited to their varNa and Aasrama out of sheer love for Thy commands, which aim at the welfare of one and all. You treat such people of blemishless conduct as exclusively Thine. How wonderful it is to reflect on this\!” 

**Commentary**

AR : 

This slOkam focuses on additional aspects of the conduct of an ideal Prapannan in the Post-Prapatthi period. They abandon sinful deeds and also Kaamya KarmAs \(thyaktha upAya vyapAyan\); if they end up engaging in such acts, they become remorseful and ashamed \(tath ubhaya karaNE sathrapAn saanuthApAn\). The acquiring of sins and the engagement in Kaamya karmas trouble them and drive them to perform PrAyascchittha Prapatthi at Your sacred feet and get cleansed of those sins \(bhUya: api tvat prapattyA praSamita kalushAn bhavati\). They follow scrupulously all of Your commands intended for the well being of all and become distinguished for the strict observance of VarNAsrama dharmams. They are blessed because they do not look at any one other than You and do not seek any phala except MOksham \(tvat nidESa preeti prApta sva-VarNAsrama subha caritAn\). These dhanyAs are so special to You that You take exclusive care of them. You rush to the rescue of these dhanyAs, who know of no refuge except You. These dhanyAs live an exemplary, single minded devoted life performing AarAdhanam to You and You alone as Your SEsha bhUthAs. They have not even a remote connection to the anya dEvathAs and consider any such involvement as a stain in their post-Prapatthi life. It is no wonder that You are moved and take such good care of them.

**Meaning**

Oh Lord of Thiruvarangam\! You bless the PrapannAs with freedom from rebirth in this samsAra maNDalam \(SrayatAm bhava abhdhou Soka Aaspada amsa mathana:\). As a result of this anugraham of Yours, those who sought refuge in You gain Moksham at the end of their life. You do however give a mixed blessing during their life on earth during the Post-Prapatthi period: You present them some sorrows while they enjoy some sukham with their bodies. 

This is commonly seen. If You had willed, You could have wiped out those sorrows and let them enjoy unalloyed sukham. There seems to be a reason for not removing those sorrows. You have perhaps concluded that the enjoyment of these alpa sukhams will create ruchi for them in the minds of the PrapannAs, which in turn will lead to their forgetting You. If the sukhams are mixed with dukkhams, then the prapannAs would gradually lose interest in the worldly sukhams and think more about You during the post-Prapatthi stage of 53 their lives. This might be the reason why PrapannAs also experience sorrows here before their ascent to Parama Padham.

nyAsa tilakam (864 to 895)

This and the following two stotras deal with nyAsa or zaraNAgati and are supplementary and complementary to zaraNAgati dIpikA ante. nyAsa tilakam, the name given by the author to it shows the importance that he himself attached to this work. (tilakam--prominent jewel or other article beautifying a person.) It consists of 32 shlokas couched in various metres from anuShTubh with eight syllables in a quarter to sragdharA [twenty-one to a quarter].

The Deity in whose praise this Stotra has been sung is Lord ra~NganAtha of shrIrangam at whose Feet AchArya rAmAnuja performed prapatti in zaraNAgati gadyam. shlokas 866 and 867 refer to shrI-prapatti which comes first, shloka 885 makes pointed reference to the special assurances given by Lord ra~NganAtha to rAmAnuja about the certainty of protection to zaraNAgatas. For these and other reasons this stotra has been taken to be an elucidation of that gadya in addition to its being an embellishment thereof in padya [Poetry].

Several doubts that are likely to assail us about the efficacy and potency of prapatti are mentioned, and at once dispelled by cogent and irrefutable data. shloka 882 deals with the obstacles to MahAvizvAsa and how to remove them. In 877 a very intricate problem is very successfully tackled, viz hopes of a glorious life in future held out to one wallowing in misery here. shlokas 883 and 884 stress the value of the blessing of an AchArya as the only panacea for wavering minds, and how an AchArya can procure to us benefits beyond us.

Towards the end, this stotra contains more than the usual measure of personal touches and introspective exclaims. The poet addresses his fickle and vacillating mind in shloka 887 and in shloka 889 informs his speech, body and mind that ve~NkaTesha kavi is now a prapanna at the lovely feet of Lord ra~NganAtha and asks them not to play their old pranks with him any longer. The Stotra winds up with a prayer to be made the recipient of the highly coveted title of “Servant of the Lord and His shrI.”

The importance of nyAsa tilakam can also be gathered from another fact. This is the only stotra for which svAmI deshika’s son and disciple, kumAra varadAchArya, has furnished a commentary in Sanskrit.
