**avatArikA**: 

This slOkam points out that Prapatthi and Bhakthi are distinctly different upAyams for Moksham. Swamy Desikan points out here their differences. 

Prapatthi needs to be observed only once; Bhakthi yOgam has to be practiced however with undiminishing intensity all thru the saadhakan’s life. There is yet another difference between Prapatthi and Bhakthi, when it comes to the destruction of one’s karmAs. There are three kinds of sins: 

1. Sanchitham [[55]] 
2. PrArabdham with its two divisions \(abhyugatha PrArabdham and anabyugatha PrArabdham\). Sanchithams are those accumulated and unspent from previous births. PrArabhdhams are those, which have begun to yield fruit. PrArabdha Karmas have two subdivisions. The anabhyagatha PrArabhdham is experienced over many janmAs. The abhyugatha PrArabdham is experienced in this life and it ends there. 
3. Aagami: Those accumulated afresh after Prapatthi. Aagami sins can be classed as resulting from unconsciously acquired ones and those which are acquired consciously. Regarding the unconsciously acquired Aagami, BhagavAn does not punish the Prapannan; for the deliberately acquired one, BhagavAn gives light punishment or destroys them when the Prapannan performs the right kind of PrAyascchitthm \(expiatory act\). 

This benefit does not exist for one practising Bhakthi yOgam. Lapses would yield one or more births for the Bhakthi yogi before he gains moksham. 

Therefore Prapatthi is superior to Bhakthi yOgam for Moksham. 

**MEANING**

Oh RanganAthA\! SaasthrAs have elaborated on the upAyams/Saadhanams for Moksham. A careful study of these Saasthrams reveals that Bhakthi yOgam like Prapatthi yOgam is also a direct upAyam for Moksham.  
Bhakthi yOgam can be practised thru many routes such as Sadh Vidhyai, Dahara Vidhyai, VaiswAnara Vidhyai etc.  
When you choose one of these Vidhyais as upAyam for Moksham, they have to choose that guNam of Yours, which is pertinent to that Vidhyai. The specific guNam \(aspect of Brahman\) for use in the different upAsanA routes for gaining Moksham have been spelled out in the various Upanishad sections and Brahma Soothrams \(III.3\). These VidhyAs are “alternatives as well as equivalents”. The Saadhaka has to pick and choose among Your many guNams in Bhakthi yOgam. 

In Prapatthi yOgam however skips the need for such a choice among the various guNams. Your intrinsic nature \(SvbhAvam/tanmai\) alone needs to be reflected upon. [[56]] Prapatthi does not need as  prerequisite Karma Yogam.  Oh Lord\! You stand in place  of Karma and Bhakthi yOgam  and help the Prapannan.  Positioning of the Lord in  place of the difficult to  practice Bhakthi yOgam or  other upAyams is Bhara  SamarpaNam or Prapatthi.  Our Lord thus becomes  nirapEksha hEthu or upAyam.  The Prapannan does not seek  other upAyams \(displays  nirapEksham\). The Lord  stands in place \(Sarva  dharmAn parithyajya\) and He  becomes the veritable  nirapEksha upAyam for the  **NirapEksha upAyam ** one performing Prapatthi.  Prapatthi is an equivalent  path for Moksham like Bhakthi yOgam, where Vedam \(Sruthi\) mandates and enjoins to engage in upAsanA: “Bhajasva, upAseetha”. Prapatthi also has a similar command in Smruthi: “SaraNam vraja”. Based on such commands, Bhakthi and Prapatthi yOgams are equivalent routes to Moksham. Prapatthi Yogam is superior in that it is done only once and it destroys the two kinds of Paapams and assures Moksham at the end of the current life. In these aspects, Prapatthi Yogam is different than Bhakthi yOgam although the end phala is the same.

**avatArikA**: 

Here, Swamy Desikan establishes that the different words used for Prapatthi are one in meaning \(paryAya Sabdhams\) as is the case with Bhakthi yOgam as well. 

**Meaning**



Oh RanganAtha\! Among the terms used for explaining Veda KarmAs, the word 

“Pasu” is used generally to denote the four legged animals. It is suggested that 58 





“Pasu” is to be used for performance of the Yaagam. Later, Karma KaaNDam specifies that “ChAkam” \(goat\) is to be used. “Pasu” is the general term and the specific four legged animal is “saakam”. MeemAmsakAs have used the ChAka-Pasu nyAyam to establish that it is the goat that has to be used, when the reference is to the four legged animal \(Pasu\). Similarly, Upanishads use multiple words for in the context of Bhakthi yOgam: 1. Vedanam \(knowing God\), 

2. DhyAnam \(meditation\) 

3. upAsanam \(reflection\) and 

4. Darsanam \(seeing through mind\). 

VedAntha Saasthrasms have established through the ChAka Pasu NyAyam approach that all these words are ParyAya sabdhams and they do not mean different things. Same is true for Prapatthi; it is called 1. Prapatthi/Prapadhana \(resorting to God\), 2. SaraNaagathy \(Total surrender to God\), 3. nyAsa \(placing the soul\), 



4. Athma nikshEpa \(surrendering the soul and placing it at the sacred feet of the Lord\), 

5. Bhara nyAsa \(leaving the burden of protection with the Lord\) and 6. tyAga \(abandonment of worries about self\). 

Again, all these different words refer to only one meaning. One SamAnya sabdham is alluded to as different visEsha Sabdhams and yet they have identical meaning and thus become ParyAya sabdhams.

**avatArikA**: 

In this slOkam, Bhakthi yOgam and Prapatthi yOgam are compared and their unique aspects are revealed. This slOkam is in the form of a question and answer so that some of the confusions over them can be removed. 

Oh RanganAtha\! Some ask this question: It is said that the small upAyam of Prapatthi is to be done by those who do not have the capabilities to engage in the most physically demanding Bhakthi yOgam. One of the most important angam of Prapatthi is Mahaa ViswAsam, which is most difficult to realize. 

60 





Therefore, should not both Bhakthi and Prapatthi yOgams be equally difficult in their own ways? Under these circumstances, it is not fair to say that Prapatthi yOgam is recommended for those, who are incapable of practising Bhakthi yOgam. 

The answer is: Yes, it is true that both the upAyams are difficult in different ways. Bhakthi yOgam has many routes among upAsanAs such as Dahara Vidhyai, VaiswAnara Vidhyai et al. The practitioners of Bhakthi yOgam choose one of them for their saadhanai. Those who can put up with the time delay in getting the coveted phala along with birth in high kulam can practise Bhakthi yOgam. 

Others who cannot wait that long for the phala of Moksham along with birth in lower varNam or Kulam choose the Prapatthi yOgam. Such people who feel sad that they can not pursue Bhakthi yOgam practise Prapatthi yOgam. This difference has to be accepted while choosing the one that is appropriate for their sakthi, Jn~Anam, VarNam and patience. There is no reason to believe that both are difficult yOgams Prapatthi yOgam is the easier one and has universal reach in spite of the difficulties to gain Mahaa ViswAsam. There is a way to gain Mahaa ViswAsam \(vide: 19th slOkam of nyAsa tilakam\) with the help of the Lord. The dismay over the difficulties of Mahaa ViswAsam as an unattainable goal is now removed and that makes Prapatthi an easier upAyam to practise without stressing one’s body thru the practise of Bhakthi yOgam without let to gain the Phalan. Further, Prapatthi has to be done only once and it takes few minutes only. Due to all these reasons, Prapatthi yOgam is a simple and non-intimidating upAyam compared to the rigors of Bhakthi yOgam. 

There may be another nagging question. Sadh Vidhyai, Dahara Vidhyai, Vaiswaanara Vidhyai et al are lumped together under the title of Bhakthi yOgam and one need to choose among them and practise one of them. 

SaasthrAs say next that one can do either Bhakthi or Prapatthi yOgam according to the adhikAri’s mental and physical fitness. 

The question is: If both of the upAyams are equal, why single out Prapatthi, while bundling all other Upanishadic vidhyAs into a bunch and call it Bhakthi 61 





yOgam? 

The answer is: a saadhakan can choose one of the Upanishadic vidhyAs to engage in Bhakthi yOgam. There is a demarcation that Prapatthi yOgam is recommended for one, who is unfit to perform Bhakthi yOgam. That is why a line has been drawn between Prapatthi and Bhakthi yOgams to show that they are distinct entities relevant for the two categories of adhikAris. adhikAra bhEdham is the underlying reason for this differentiation \(VibhAgam\). Bhakthi yOgam is ghanam \(heavy\) and Prapatthi yOgam is light \(laghu\). One who is anarhathan \(unqualified\) for Bhakthi yOgam due to deficiency in sakthi, Jn~Anam, impatience to put up with delays in gaining Moksham, birth in low kulam can choose Prapatthi yOgam.

**avatArikA**: 



This slOkam reveals the superiority of Prapatthi yOgam as an easy route to gain Moksha Siddhi and states that all Phalans including Moksham can be realized through Prapatthi. Leaving this laghu upAyam and choosing the difficult to practise Bhakthi yOgam according to Swamy Desikan would be the height of foolishness. Kumara VaradAcchAr Swamy chooses the word of 

“Buddhi DhourBalyam” for some one who chooses the difficult Bhakthi yOgam over easy to practise Prapatthi yOgam. The efficacy of Prapatthi to yield all four PurushArthams instead of Moksham alone is emphasized here. One needs only to specify the PurushArtham desired. One commentator points out that it is the height of folly \(alpa buddhi\) for ill equipped adhikAri to choose Bhakthi yOgam over Prapatthi, when he knows that he is least qualified to master the rigors of Bhakthi yOgam. Lakshmi tantra slOkam is the PramANam for these views: “narasya buddhi dhourbalyAth upAyAntharam yeeshyathE”. It is the 63 





feeble mindedness of the deluded people that propels them to choose the other upAyam \(Bhakthi yOgam\). 

**Meaning**



Oh Rangasaayee\! When one performs yajn~ams and yaagams, people seek some karma phalas like worldly wealth, progeny etc. Similarly, they perform upAsaNaa \(Bhakthi yOgam\) and gain the phala of their choice. The Prapatthi performed by chEtanams at Your sacred feet has the power to yield all the four PurushArthams including Moksham. While this is so, it is hard to understand why people who are incapable of going through the rigors of practising Bhakthi Yogam for Moksham select this route instead of easy to practise Prapatthi. One can only understand it as the expression of their stubborn foolishness. Therefore, it is wise for one who is unfit to engage in Bhakthi yOgam should seek Prapatthi for realizing Moksham.

**avatArikA**: 

Here Swamy Desikan raises some doubts about Prapatthi and clears them up for our benefit. Swamy places himself in our position and helps us to clear our minds of the doubts that assail us about the efficacy of Prapatthi. Five doubts nag us: 

1. How can our bundles of sins accumulated over many janmAs be wiped out by a single expiatory act? 

2. How can we be lifted to the exalted abode of the Lord \(Srivaikuntam\), 65 





which is not easy to reach even by the likes of Brahma and Sivan? 

3. How can the Lord grant us the supreme most Phalan of Moksha SaamrAjyam forever in return for such a small and trivial act of Prapatthi? 

4. How is it possible that requesting for such a gift only once can lead to its realization? 

5. How can the Lord grant such a profound soubhAgyam to all and sundry irrespective of their status and attainments? 

These five doubts that assail even the scholars are known as SankhA Panchagam and Swamy Desikan clears these doubts for us and reminds us that Prapatthi is supremely powerful because of the glories of Sriman nArAyaNan as the Omnipotent Lord and Consort of Ramaa Devi \(Ramaa Pathithva Subhagam\). 







**Sriyapathi- Narayana-svami **

66 





**Meaning**



Those who perform saraNaagathi are assailed by five doubts that interfere with the important angam of Mahaa ViswAsam in their Prapatthi. The first doubt is: How can Prapatthi done only once can be effective? \(kartavyam sakrudhEva, hanta\!\). They say that all our mighty bundles of sins are destroyed by this one time observance \(tata sarvam kalusham naSyati\). How is this possible? The Lord grants the Prapannan a sthAnam in His Supreme abode, which is hard to gain even by the likes of great ones like Brahma and Sivan \(brahma Isaadi sudurlabham padam api mayaa draag prApyam\). How can I believe that myself of limited spiritual attainments hope to get such a lofty sthAnam? These are the doubts that assail one and interfere with the development of Mahaa ViswAsam in the Lord as the SaraNaagatha Rakshakan \(iti nyastAm idam viswAsa pratibandhi cintanam\). All these doubts are removed by Your very nature of being Sriman Narayana, the divine consort of Mahaa Lakshmi **\(**ramApatitva subhagam tava nArAyaNatvam viswAsa pratibhandhi cintanam nasyati\). 

**Commentary**

AR : 



Several attributes of the Lord are “corollaries derivable from His naarAyaNathvam and Swamithvam”. These provide the answers to the SankhA Panchakam and help to build Mashaa ViswAsam, the important angam of Prapatthi. Sriman D. Ramaswamy Iyengar explains these unique attributes of Sriman nArAyaNaa that is pertinent to enhance our Mahaa ViswAsam in Him as our Rakshakan: 

1. Sri Mahaa Lakshmi is always with Him. She pleads with Him for us. She has vaalabhyam \(influence\) over Him. He can not and will not refuse to accept Her persuasive pleading on our behalf. At the same time, She has Vaathsalyam for us as Her children and pleads for us \(PurushakArathvam\) as soon as we seek Her protecting grace. She prevails on Her Lord to wipe out our immense sins. 

67 





2. He is nArAyaNaa, One who is in all beings and all beings are with in Him. 

This interminable relationship between Him and us means and involves that He is anxious to get us back to Himself and we are to go to Him \(Mumukshuthvam\). He is waiting only for a vyAja or pretext to protect us. When we raise our hands in anjali bhaddha mudhrA, He clasps them and draws us unto Himself. 

3. His innate love towards us is so immense that even a small act on our part \(Prapatthi\) pleases Him. 

4. His Dayaa can not brook delay and He gives us instantaneous relief 5. He does not differentiate between the poor and the rich, the learned ones and the unlettered. His nature is “taram paarAthE 



taruhai” \(granting His boons without discrimination\). 

Thus His naarAyaNathvam and Swamithvam that are answers for the five doubts that assail us. Swamy Desikan provides His samAdhana panchakam for our SankhA Panchakam using the guNams linked to the naarAyaNa padham.

This slOkam celebrates the importance of AchArya KaTaaksham. Swamy Desikan points out that AchArya nishtai is the upAyam \(means/route\) for those who are not qualified to observe svanishtai or ukthi nishtai. Swamy Desikan elaborates on this point in his upAya VibhAgAdhikaaram of Srimath Rahasya Thraya Saaram. The importance of AchArya KaTaaksham induced by Bhagavath Sankalpam is recognized as the primary cause for successful Prapatthi. 

**Meaning**



Oh Lord of Thiruvarangam\! adiyEn is a major sinner. adiyEn is incapable of pursuing Karma, Jn~Ana or Bhakthi yOgams. Therefore, adiyEn has come forward to perform Prapatthi and utter the dhvaya mantram associated with 69 





Bhara nyAsam. In view of adiyEn’s impure mind my BharanyAsam does not get fulfilled. Oh Lord\! When adiyEn was in this terrible state, You took pity on adiyEn and out of Your compassion pointed out an AchAryan for me. The dayaa laden glances of that AchAryan fell on adiyEn. His first glance became my supporting stick and fulfilled my Prapatthi for Moksham. Oh Lord\! You are the primary cause for this auspiciousness arising from the efficacy of the AchAryan’s KaTaaksham. 

Your benevolence \(Isvarasya souhArtham\) is the prime factor for AchArya Prapatthi for adiyEn.

This slOkam emphasizes the importance of AchArya nishtai. This slOkam praises the AchArya nishtai with three examples and asks us to place our total faith in the AchArya, who has an abundance of Jn~Anam, Sakthi and Dayaa and therefore can secure us Moksham .The full anugraham of the Lord will become available to a sAdhakan because of the dayaa of the AchArya, even if the sishyA does not know anything about “ the theistic ontology”. 

**Meaning**



Oh RanganAtha\! It is customary for a blind man to seek the help of a man with good eye sight to take him to his desired destination. A lame man with limited mobility is lifted and placed in the center of the boat by a boatman to ferry the lame man across the river. The child of a servant of the King enjoys the benefits of its father’s position \(presents from the royal household\), even if it 71 





is not aware of the King. 

Similarly, an aspirant 

for Moksham, who does 

not have the Jn~Anam 

\(as in the case of the

power \(as in the case of

Prapatthi can entrust

Even if the sishyan does not know the subtelities of Prapatthi, AchAryan blesses the sishyan to enjoy the Bhagavath bhOga anubhavam. AchArya KaTaaAksham accomplishes all these things. The key passage of this slOkam is: 

“mE tvat samprAptou dayALu: desika: prabhavati” \(Oh Lord\! In attaining You, the merciful AchAryan becomes the powerful instrument\).

In this slOkam, Swamy Desikan is recalling fondly his sambhandham with AchArya Ramanuja and reflects on the conversation between AchArya Ramanuja and Sri RanganathA during the celebrated Panguni Uthtiram day of the birth of SaraNaagathy gadhyam. Swamy Desikan’s longing for direct sambhandham with AchArya RaamAnuja in spite of the gap in their avathAra times led to Swamy Desikan’s creation of Sankalpa SuryOdhayam, where he realizes his intense desire by positioning RaamAnuja as his AchAryan and himself as His \(RaamAnuja’s\) sishyan. In this slOkam, Swamy Desikan appeals to the Lord for His protection as a RaamAnuja sambhandhi. His prayer is 

“nityam praseeda bhagavan mayi ranganAtha” \(Oh Ranganatha\! Please always bless adiyEn with Your protecting grace\). In the previous slOkam, Swamy Desikan referred to the centrality of AchAryA’s grace in securing Moksham. 

Here, Swamy Desikan refers to His sambhandham with Udayavar through the 73 





connecting AchAryAs \(AppuLLAr, NadAthUr AmmAL of Kaanchi, EngaLAzhwAn of ThiruveLLaRai and KidAmbi AcchAn\). Now, Swami Desikan invokes the name of Ramanuja to pray to Lord RanganAtha for enduring protection. 

Swamy Kumara VaradAcchAr sums up the essence of this slOkam this way: “na kEvalam asmath AchArya abhimAna mAthrENa dhrupyAma:, apithu Parama-GurOr-bhagavath RaamAnujaaryasya bhagavathA dhattham varamapi SruthvA tath sambhandhApi vayam” \(We are not satisfied merely with our AchArya abhimAnam. We are elated to hear the assurances given by Lord RanganAtha to Bhagavath RaamAnuja during the Panguni Utthiram day to accept his \(RamanujA’s\) SaraNAgathy. We are proud to recall this Bhagavath RaamAnuja sambhandham. Oh Lord\! Bless adiyEn for this reason is the prayer of Swamy Desikan\). 

**Meaning**



Oh Ranganatha\! Oh My Lord\! You assured RaamAnujA about the fulfilment of his appeal for SaraNaagathy by quoting Your earlier assurances to Arjuna at KurukshEthram \(Sarva dharmAn Parithyajya--\) and VibhIshaNa at the ocean side \(SakrudhEva prapannAya---Vratham Mama**\)**. Using the incarnations as KrishNa and Raama, You uttered these words and grew their Mahaa ViswAsam in You as the SaraNaagatha Rakshakan. You grew RaamAnujA’s Mahaa ViswAsam by quoting Your SaraNaagathy Vaakyams to Arjuna and VibhishaNa and reminded RaamAnujA that those earlier assurances of Yours will not become false. adiyEn has heard about Your assurances to my ParamAchAryan and am proud of my sambhandham to RaamAnuja. Oh Bhagavann\! Please bless this servant of Yours always, who is proud of his sambhandham to Udayavar.

The Lord is willing and waiting to confer any thing and every thing on those, who seek His rakshaNam even once. He dwells within every one as antharyAmi and is always near us. He is the supreme Brahman extolled by the Upanishads. 

Such a great One is awaiting for us to use the simple act of Prapatthi as a pretext to grant us all that we seek including the supreme bliss of Moksham. 

In spite of this extremely fortunate situation, Oh Lord, my mind is chasing ceaselessly after the perishable and sorrow producing worldly desires. Alas, I am lost. 

\(Here Swamy Desikan is performing upadEsam for us as the need for naicchiyam, when we get into such situations of straying away from the chinthanais about the Lord\). 

75 





**Commentary**

AR : 

The upadEsam about the SaraNaagathy doctrines were concluded with the previous \(23rd \) SlOkam. In the remaining ten slOkams of Sri nyAsa tilakam, Swamy Desikan introduces a personal touch. For instance, in this slOkam, he expresses his despair and nirvEdham over forgetting the Lord and chasing after worldly desires. Swamy Desikan has all of us in mind, when he relates to the Lord in this manner. His AachAram, anushtAnam and VairAgyam are exemplary. Hence the sentiments expressed here is to be treated as ParOpadEsam. This slOkam is included by Swamy Desikan in Sankalpa SooryOdhayam \(10.44\). Purusha expresses his feeling of fear and anxiety even after the righteous forces of Viveka has defeated the unrighteous forces of MahAmOhan. In this context, Sri D.R. Swamy points out that we have to be on the vigil until the actual attainment of Moksha. 

One can not let down the guard against any temptations that will tempt us towards the vishaya sukhams driven by the chEshtais of the indhriyams.

**avatArikA**: 



In the previous slOkam, the mood was nirvEdham. In this slOkam, it is one of elation over gaining the boon of Moksham due to the SaraNaagathy that has been performed by the merciful AchAryAs. Swamy Desikan engages in an act of Maanasa sambhodhanam and asks his mind: “Sri Ranganathan, who can not go against the wishes of SadAchAryAs, has accepted your Prapatthi. Why do you worry anymore? You are going surely to ascend Parama Padham. Until the day ordained for the body to fall down, dEha yAthrai will continue here. You have already rejected the short lasting pleasures of Svargam and have gone after the nithya kaimkarya sukham at Sri Vaikuntam. Our Lord has responded positively to the command of Your SadAchAryan and guaranteed you a position in His supreme abode. What are you worried about now? Things have fallen in place. What else do you wish?” This slOkam says that Prapannan can and should be free from worries about dEha yAthrai. Be assured that You will get 77 





Moksham as a Prapannan automatically through the power of the SadAchAryan and hence there is no further effort needed on your part. 

**Meaning**



My dear Mind\! Why do you suffer so much about dEha yaathra? As long as we are here, that will continue. It will follow the route of the KarmAs \(karmAnuguNam\). 

The enjoyment in Svargam does not last beyond three or four days. Once the PuNyam responsible for Svarga lOka anubhavam is spent, then the continued residence in Svargam will be over. I have rejected this option for that reason. 

Lord RanganAthan welcomes and obeys the wishes of the SadAchAryans. He is therefore going to grant You the boon of Moksham since the SadAchAryans have recommended it. Oh My Mind\! Please do not worry any more. What other boon can You hope to desire? 





**Do not worry about dEhayAtra **

This slOkam reminds us of the message of VairAgya Panchakam of Swamy Desikan, where he clearly stated that he will not praise anyone and especially the rich for a living. AzhwArs have declared loudly that their Paasurams are exclusively for PerumAL and not for praising the rich men \(Swamy NammAzhwAr: ThiruvAimozhi III.9\). 

At ThirumAlirumchOlai, PeriyAzhwAr expressed a similar sentiment in his Thirumozhi: “Unakku PaNi seythirullum tavam udayEn, inippOy oruvan tanakku paNinthu kadaittalai niRka SaraNadaya azhivu KaNDAi" **-** Oh Lord of ThriumAlirum Cholai\! adiyEn has been blessed to perform daasa Kaimkaryam for You.

**Moksha DhAyaka Mukunda Rangan **

**Meaning**



The great Mukundhan, the Moksha Daayakan, has taken up the duties as promised of my Yoga KshEmam \(Yoga kshEmam vahAmyaham\). His incomparable dayaa lets Him excuse even if one commits apachArams frequently. He forgives us once we repent over them and perform the right kind of PrAyascchittham. His Dayaa does not experience any change and as a result, He becomes easily approachable. He is the most generous one \(Mukunda Rangan\). He blesses us with all kinds of soubhAgyams both here and in the hereafter. While we have Him caring for us across the broad spectrum of soubhAgyams, why would I seek the generosity of the haughty insignificant 

“Prabhus”? The minds of these haughty rich are filled with arrogance and pride. Their arrogance sticks to them like hard cement. Why would I praise these horrible ones and lose adiyEn’s svaroopam?

Swamy Desikan notices that his upadEsam to the worldly ones is wasted on them and they still run after the arrogant rich to seek rewards thru their servitude and eulogies. Swamy Desikan gives up on them and redirects his attention to his KaraNa Thrayam \(Vaak, manas and sareeram\) and appeals to them in upadEsam format: 

1. Oh Mother\! My Vaak\! Please banish your flattery of men. Oh My Body\! 

Please be contented that what you have acquired so far by rightful 82 





means is enough. Oh My Mind\! Please take into account the humiliations that you have received from standing at the doors of the rich misers. 

Kavi VenkatEsA’s burden for rakshaNam of the Aathmaa has been placed already at the sacred feet of Lord RanganAtha by himself. Our Lord is “the ultimate and He is the meaning behind all words”. He is the anthrAthma for all and He is the Supreme Being. There is no one equal or greater than Him. Oh My Vaak, Manas and Kaayam\! Remember this message and desist from every thing than eulogizing the Lord, performing Kaimkaryams for Him with mind and body. This VenkatEsa kavi has already placed his Aathma RakshA bharam at the sacred feet of Lord RanganthAn on his own. 

**Meaning**





Oh Vaak, my Mother\! Please give up now flattering the humans\! Oh my body\! 

Please be contented with what you have got. Do not run after more. Oh my mind\! Do not go through the humiliation of standing before the house of misers with folded hands seeking rewards. 

adiyEn VenkatEsa kavi has placed at the sacred feet of Lord RanganAtha, what all adiyEn can obtain in this and the other world. From here on adiyEn’s protection is His responsibility. For You, my thri karaNams, Our Lord of Srirangam is Your target. All sabdhams state that He is the meaning behind them \(Sarva sabdha Vaachyan\). He is our AathmA as well. He is our Lord and is the eternal, undimishing bliss \(AarAamutham\). 

Therefore my thri KaraNams, worship Him with unwavering focus\!

**avatArikA**: 

In the previous slOkam, Swamy Desikan instructed his thri KaraNams not to serve the insignificant, haughty rich. Now he says that he will not even look at their faces as a Prapannan. This is about not doing mukhAvalOkanam of the haughty rich, who are known for humiliating those seek favours from them. 

The Lord has instructed us: “MaamEkam SaraNam vraja”. Why would one seek adhikAris other than the omnipotent Lord? Oh RanganAtha\! adiyEn’s svaroopam is to perform Kaimkaryam for You and You alone. adiyEn feels blessed to have the bhAgyam of serving You. While that is my credo, why would adiyEn wander 85 





into the forecourts of alpa dhanikAs and stand before them seeking their favours? These misers are fierce to look at and snarl at those, who seek alms and scream at them and humiliate these beggars at their doors. They take a great delight in their haughty condescension. 

Oh RanganAthA\! Please spare me any such humiliations. I am Your unconditional servant awaiting Your AadEsams as my one and only Lord. Please bless adiyEn to be at Your service always and chase away all other propensities. 

**Meaning**



Oh Ranga\! adiyEn’s mind leaps with joy to perform kaimkaryam for You in a state of mind as Your nithya, nirupAdhika Seshan \(rangEswara\! laasyavatA manasA dAsyam anumatya tvat padE nityam aham kimkaravANi**\)**. adiyEn will not even look at the faces of those fierce rich, who take pride in humiliating those who have assembled at their doors seeking favours \(kasyacit AaDhyakasya vadanE bhikshA vilakshaam drusam puna: na tu kuryAm\). \(This slOkam is the third in the series rejecting the haughty rich for favours. Here, Swamy Desikan affirms his determination to the Lord directly. This slOkam is used by Swamy Desikan in Sankalpa SooryOdhayam: Act VI. slOkam 69\).

You are united with the AakAra thraya Sampannai; MahA Lakshmi. You are the Varadhan, who grants all the boons that one desires. You are the Sarva sahan, Sarva aparAdha sahishNu \(One who overlooks our trespasses out of Your natural Vaathsalyam\). Displaying all these anantha kalyANa GuNams, You are our true Master \(Swami\). While this is an unimpeachable fact, how can one stop to address a simple human known as the 87 





abode of all frailties as “Swamin” and other honorific titles? 

**Meaning**



Oh RanganAtha\! You are nirvyAja sahishNu \(one who forgives all aparAdhams without seeking a cause\). You have in Your ThirumEni, the Periya PirAtti as Your lakshaNam \(tava kalyANa Aathmani kamalaam dharathy\). Oh Moksha dAyaka MukundhA\! You stand as YathOktha Kaari for those, who fold their hands in anjali mudhrA in front of You\! You become totally under their control.

May Thou live long\! Oh Master\! Please consider me as one of your own\!” That is impossible for me to say and my tongue becomes ashamed even over this thought. Such statements extolling the indulgent rich would be “pacchai pasum poykaL” in AzhwAr’s words.

**avatArikA**: 



In the previous four slOkams, Swamy Desikan declared that he will not seek any one else \(alpa dhanikans\) other than the magnificent PerumAL, the MahOnnatha danikan. Here, Swamy Desikan declares that he will not seek any anya dEvathAs either, while Sri RanganAthan stands tall as the matchless, Supreme Being. Swamy points out that the act of approaching the alpa dhanikAs or the anya dEvathAs is laughable matter as well as a fruitless one, which deserves condemnation. “SaraNaagatha kaama dhugE tvayi sati, vidhi Siva pramukhAn katham adhikurmahE?” is the question of Swamy Desikan. Oh RangA\! While You are here as KaamadhEnu for SaraNaagathAs, why would any one seek BrahmA, Sivan and other demi gods, who appear as though they can grant all kinds of boons? They can only give Phalans that are limited by dEsam and Kaalam. We shall perform our SaraNaagathy to You alone, who can bless us with the eternal bliss of residing in Your Supreme abode. We are PrapannAs 89 





and therfore are “thvadhEkAnthis” \(we will not worship anyone but You\). 







**mahOnnatha danikan **

**Meaning**



Oh Lord of Srirangam\! You are filled with Your limitless dayaa pravAham \(niravadhika phravAha karuNaa pariNaahavati\). You are the boon giver of all what the SaraNaagathAs desire \(SaraNaagata kaamadhugE tvayi\). When You stand tall in this magnificent manner, how can one justify seeking gods like Brahma, Sivan and other Karma Vasyars, who have been granted small powers by You because of their fierce tapas. We as PrapannAs will not approach them for any thing \(parimita dEsa kAla phaladAn, phaladha AakrutikAn amukAn vidhi Siva pramukhAn katham adhikurmahE?\). These pramukhaas have been empowered by You \(Sriman naarAyaNan resting on Your serpent bed at Srirangam\) and appear like that they 90 





are the ones, who grant their boons limited by place and time. How can we get near them knowing their svaroopams? These pramukhAs are Your servants just like us, the PrapannAs.

**avatArikA**: 

This slOkam deals with the nithya kaimkaryam to the dhivya dampathis, which is the goal and purpose of our lives. This aspiration for nithya Kaimkaryam at Sri Vaikuntam is sought thru Prapatthi. Through such nithya Kaimkaryam, our undissolvable Seshathvam is displayed. The dhivya dampathis bless us with this boon of nithya kaimkaryam that we so ardently seek. They let us enjoy the great service to them that is endless \(NaaLUm MeeLAtha pEradimai\). The wealth of service \(sevaa sampadham\) at Their sacred feet as a result of their acceptance of adiyEn’s SaraNaagathy through a SadAchAryan that they 92 





themselves identified for adiyEn. 

The sacred PraNavam is included as the starting Padham in this slOkam. It is customary not to include PraNavam in writing. KumAra VaradAchAr observes in His commentary that the meaning of PraNavam here is “respectful acceptance” 

of sought after Sesha Vrutthi \(the chosen way of life as the unconditional servant\) through the blessing response “tataasthu” \(May that be\!\). 

KumAra VaradAchAr Swamy’s exact words are: “atha: param, Moola mantrasya padha-kramENa, Seshathva sahitham Paaratantryam prakASya naarAyaNa padhastha chaturthi abhiprEtham kaimkarya roopam purshaarthamapi visadhayathi Omithi”. Swamy Desikan reminds us of our nishtai here through the meanings of PraNavam: 



1. The first Padham, PraNavam denotes our Seshathvam In the combination of the letters to make up PraNavam \(A \+ % \+ m\) \(a \+ u \+ m\) the middle aksharam stands for ThAyAr. Hence the Seshathvam of the Jeevan is to both PerumAL and ThAyAr. 

2. The second Padham, “nama:”: this stands for the removal of our independence \(SvAtantryam\) and the acceptance of divine sovereignty over us. One’s avidhyA \(ignorance\) about us being Svatantra purushAs is removed. We recognize that we are Paratantran to the dhivya dampathis and our ahankAra, MamakArams are destroyed. 

3. naarAyaNa sabdham is the third Padham. This stands for the purushArtham of Kaimkaryam to the dhivya dampathis at all times, places and states. 

4. The fourth case: “Aaya” sabdham: This emphasizes the ChEtanan exists only for the BhOgam of the dhivya dampathis. Swamy Desikan indicates that the Lord of RanganAyaki accepted the prayer for Sesha Vrutthi as elaborated by the Moolamantram. 



93 





**Meaning**



Oh Lord of Srirangam \(ranga nrupatE\), Oh Lord of Periya PirAtti \(indirEsa\)\! 

“adiyEn shall obtain \(am sure of obtaining\) without effort, the wealth of all exclusive and limitless service to the two of You, who are possessed of eternal, countless and unbounded riches and attributes; please accept with joy adiyEn’s state of servitude inappropriate for others; please, do away with my state of age-long and immense ignorance like SvAtantryam from You”. 







**indirESan **

**Commentary**

AR : 

There are ten levels of interpretation of the Meanings of Moola mantram \(vide Srimath Rahasya Thraya Saaram\). Swamy Desikan incorporates the seventh yOjanai \(mode of interpretation\) in this slOkam according to Kuricchi Gopala TatAcchAr Swamy. The links between the slOkam passages and the sections of the seventh yOjanai are as follows: 

94 





1. “Omiti abhyupagamya ranganrupatE: ananya ucitAm SeshatAm” deals with the elaboration of the meanings of PraNavam 2. nama: sabdha vivaraNam is handled by the second line starting from 

“SvAtantryAdi mayeem mahateem avidyA sthitim apOhya”. anishta nivrutthi \(removal of the inauspiciousness of Svatantryam by the jeevan, while in reality it is a paratanran for the dhivya dampathis\). 

Attainment of Their feet is indicated here. 

3. The third and the fourth lines are elaborations of the naarAyaNa sabdham of the Moola mantram and the Chathurthi vibhakthi. Portions of the third line \(nitya asankhya viseema bhUti guNayO:\) refers to the glories of naarAyaNa sabdham \(eternal holders of immeasurable wealth and anantha kalyANa guNams\). The word indirEsa in the fourth line refers to the YekasEshithvam of the dhivya dampathis. They are Seshathva Prathisambhandhis. The salutation “ranganrupatE:” is indicative of the Lord’s soulabhyam and other ubhayuktha guNams. 

Swamy admits exultingly that there is no more hindrance to the dhivya dampathis accepting his SaraNaagathy and granting him the wealth of eternal, blemishless Kaimkaryam \(niravadhya sevaa sampadham\) now that the divine couple has responded with “May that come to be\! \(Omiti abhyupagamya\)”.

**avatArikA**: 

The previous slOkam focused on the elaboration of Moola Mantram. This slOkam expands now on the dhvaya mantram. There are lot of references to Lakshmana, the Kaimkarya Lakshmi paripoorNan \(according to Sri D. 

Ramaswamy IyengAr Swamy\); some of the words chosen by Swamy Desikan remind the Brahma Soothram IV.1.17 \(according to MadhurAnthakam VeerarAghavaacchAr Swamy\). What happens to a Jeevan after receiving dhvaya mantra upadEsam from one’s AchAryan is described here. The Prapannan attains knowledge about his svaroopam \(i.e.\), he is an unconditional 96 





Seshan of the dhivya dampathis. When the Prapatthi is completed, all the sins accumulated up to that time are destroyed due to the grace of the Lord. The sins acquired unconsciously do not stick to me. After my body falls down, You should bless me to travel via archirAdhi mArgam and bless me with all aspects of Moksha sukham. This is the prayer of Swamy Desikan as he nears the end of nyAsa tilakam. 

**Meaning**



Ranga dhurya \(Oh Lord of Sri Rangam\)\! The moment adiyEn receives dhvaya mantrOpadEsam from adiyEn’s AchAryan, adiyEn gains knowledge about my true nature \(Svaroopa Satthu\) as unconditional Seshan for You and Your Devi \(AchAryAth dvaya samadhigamE labdha sattam\). At that moment \(tadAtvE\), the accumulated sins of adiyEn also get destroyed; Poorva bharam is gone now and the sins that adiyEn will acquire unconsciously in the future \(utthara bharam\) are not going to stick to me \(tadAtve vislishTa aslishTa poorva uttara durita bharam**\)**. VislishTa Karmaas are sins from previous births and are PrArabhdhams. AaslishTa karmAs are of two kinds. Those which are acquired after Prapatthi unconsciously will not stick to one because one has performed Prapatthi. 

Those future sins acquired deliberately will yield light punishments during this birth and can also be eliminated by appropriate Punah PrAyascchittham**. **After the body falls down, You should lead me to Your Supreme abode through Your servants \(archirAdhi maarga prayANam\). Out of Your limitless KaaruNyam, You should make my shrunken \(Sankuchitham\) Jn~Anam to blossom \(vikasitham\) to its full potential. 

The uninterrupted enjoyment of Your soundharyam and kalyANa guNams should be my bhOgam \(bliss\). You should bless adiyEn to be the object of Your great vaathsalyam and grant adiyEn the soubhAgyam of nithya kaimkaryam for Your preethi. 

97 









**bless me with jn~Ana vikAsam - Srirangam HayagrIvan** 98 





**Commentary**

AR : 

adiyEn has approached a SadAchAryan and have performed now MokshArtha SaraNaagathy through the utterance of Dhvayam as KaraNa mantram. During the SaraNaagathy time, adiyEn’s sanchitha, PrArabdha sins are gone. The Buddhi Poorvaka and abuddhi poorvaka sins accumulated during the post-Prapatthi period are also destroyed at the end of this life thru the experience of light punishment or through the performance of appropriate PrAyascchittham. Now that all of these are done due to Your immense krupai, adiyEn requests You to bless me with the travel via archirAdhi mArgam to Your Supreme abode with the help of Your archirAdhi dEvathAs. You should bless adiyEn with Jn~Ana vikAsam and Aanandham once I cross the Viraja River and let me become the object of Your affection \(Preethi Paathran\) and empower adiyEn to serve You with blemishless kaimkaryams that will please You.

EANI

AND **Commentary**

AR : 

Swamy Desikan states that this Sri Sookthi arose from his mouth as a direct result of the command of Lord RanganAtha. It is His divine command \(dhivya Ajn~aa\) that arose from His own lotus face \(sva-mukhAmbhOja udhitham\). The Lord of Srirangam is resting happily on His huge bed of Aadhi Seshan like a mountain made up of chinthAmaNi gems and grants all the boons that the devotees desire. For those, who recite this Sri Sookthi of nyAsa tilakam, He blesses them with Kaimkarya PrApatthi to Him in this world as He stays in His reclining posture. In the other world, He grants Kaimkarya saamrAjyam from His seated position on the throne of AadhisEshan. 

Swamy Desikan has provided an apoorva Phalasruthi for this apoorva Sri Sookthi. NyAsam is the Tilakam \(“high watermark”\) in our lives. The siddha purushAs use various herbs and pigments to create a paste that is worn by 100 





human beings to enchant the kings and to gain their favour. Similarly, there is one way to enchant the Lord and make Him come under our influence. That way is the recitation of nyAsa tilaka SrI Sookthi composed by VenkatEsa Kavi in response to the command of Lord RanganAtha and in a way He instructed Swamy Desikan. Lord RanganAtha provided the recipe and then commanded Swamy Desikan to prepare the Tilakam for NyAsa Vidhyai. A study of this Sri Sookthi will reveal the glories and beauty of nyAsam just as a colourful, bright tilakam on the forehead of a girl would reveal her beauty. Swamy Desikan states that he learnt the procedure of making this material for Tilakam from the Lord Himself and therefore this SrI Sookthi is resplendent with the word arrangements that glitter \(sphurat varNam\). For those who recite it and reflect on the meanings of this Sri Sookthi of nyAsa tilakam and perform SaraNaagathi \(parikalayatAm praNata janAnAm\), the chinthAmaNi mountain enjoying His sayanam on His bed of AadhisEshan \(cintAmaNi giri: phaNi paryanka rasika:\) grants all the desired boons in this and the other world \(yEsha rasika: iha amutra api sva paryangE sEvAm disati\). 

Sri D. Ramaswamy IyengAr has a wonderful observation about the origin of this Sri Sookthi, where he visualizes a conversation between the Lord of Srirangam and Swamy Desikan standing in front of Him. The one sided conversation goes this way: “Oh Kavi Tarkika Kesari\! You sung about us in Bhagavath DhyAna SopAnam to celebrate My dhivya soundharyam. You are going to sing about My well being \(safety\) through Your abheethi Sthavam. You have not sung anything about nyAsa VidhyA and My response to Udayavar, when that PrAchAryan of Yours performed his SaraNAaagathy on a Panguni Utthiram sErthi day here at Srirangam. Don’t You remember that I am the God of Ramanuja’s SaraNaagathy Gadhyam?” Swamy Desikan now understood that the Lord of Srirangam is commanding him to create a sthOthram about the fine points of SaraNaagathy and completed it and placed it at the sacred feet of the delighted Lord of Srirangam. That PraNatha Jana ChinthAmaNi Giri and PhaNi paryanka Rasikan, Lord Ranganathan turns our way wherever we are and casts His dayaa laden glances on us, when we recite this Sri Sookthi of nyAsa 101 





tilakam. 

May this humble effort to collate the commentary from five AchAryAs please the Lord of Srirangam\! May His divine consort make us the object of Dayaa of Her Lord\! May Swamy Desikan, who opened our eyes to the splendour of SaraNaagathy by building upon the foundation laid by His PoorvAchAryAs live forever in AasthikA’s minds\!
