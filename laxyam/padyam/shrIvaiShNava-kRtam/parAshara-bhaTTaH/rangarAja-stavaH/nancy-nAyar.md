Foreword 
We are very pleased to provide to our readers the publication en- titled Praise-Poems to Vişnu and Śrī: The Stotras of Rāmānuja's Immediate Disciples by Nancy Ann Nayar. While the philoso- phy of Rāmānuja has been widely studied, the thought of this il- lustrious Acarya and his position within the Śrīvaiṣṇava sam- pradaya cannot be well understood without reference to the works of his immediate disciples and companions. Unfortu- nately, these compositions have been almost entirely ignored out- side of the Śrīvaiṣṇava tradition itself. For this reason, it has been a long-standing desire of mine to see the stotras of Kūresa and Parāśara Bhattar translated into English. The stotra poets quote the Upanisads time and time again; scholars of the Vedas will be interested to see the creative ways in which the philoso- phy of these timeless texts appear in poems of praise directed to the main deities of major Vaiṣṇava temples in Tamil Nadu. 
Dr. Nancy Ann Nayar worked with the members of the Anan- thacharya Indological Research Institute's staff for a period of nine months in 1986-87, during which time she translated the Sanskrit poems and began the study of the Tamil language. Her Ph.D. dissertation (McGill University, Montreal, Canada) theological analysis of the stotras -- was published in 1992 by Otto Harrassowitz in Wiesbaden, Germany, under the title Poetry As Theology: The Śrīvaiṣṇava Stotra in the Age of Ramanuja.

The work of Dr. Nayar is a major contribution to the study of Śrīvaiṣṇavism. It especially bridges the gap between Rāmānuja and his contemporaries, on the one hand, and the later Acaryas on the other. The major concepts of Śrīvaiṣṇavism

We sincerely hope that this volume will stimulate interest in the important formative years of the Śrīvaiṣṇava tradition. It is a most valuable contribution both for those scholars who have ac- cess to the original Sanskrit compositions, and for the general public interested in learning more about the theological and de- votional aspects of South Indian Vaiṣṇavism.

In the preparation of this volume, I am deeply indebted to Dr. K.K.A. Venkatachari, who is simultaneously Director of the Ananthacharya Indological Research Institute and Professor at the University of Bombay. During my stay in Bombay from October 1986 to June 1987, he assisted me in the translation of the stotras, especially concerning problems regarding Śrī- vaiṣṇava idiom and semantics. He was also helpful in the diffi- cult task of identifying phrases and images which were rendered into Sanskrit from their Tamil antecedents, the hymns of the Āļvārs. Our visits to the major Śrīvaiṣṇava shrines praised in the stotras the Srirangam Temple in Tirucci, Alakar Kōyil outside Madurai, and Varadaraja Swami Temple in Kañcīpuram (all in what is now the state of Tamil Nadu) -- added substantially to my appreciation for, and sensitivity to, the many attractive de- scriptions of Vişņu's iconic incarnations and His terrestrial dwelling places contained in the stanzas.

Thanks are also due to Dr. V.V. Gangal and Pandit K.K.C. Laksminarasimhan for their assistance in the preparation of the initial draft of the translation of the stotras of Kūresa and Bhaṭṭar. Furthermore, Pandit Laksminarasimhan instructed me in the Tamil language during my stay in Bombay. Professor Richard Hayes of McGill University helped me in the translation of one particularly problematic stanza. 
I am grateful to the Shastri Indo-Canadian Institute for a fel- lowship which financed my trips to and stays in Bombay and Tamil Nadu during 1986-87. 
I would like to express my appreciation to Sister Noella Bolduc, m.c.c.c. and all of the members of the MECUM Con- templative Christian Community for their prayers and friendship over the past eight years of research and writing, including Johanne Auger, Grace Fournier, Linda Friedland, Suzanne Jonas,

Each of my daughters Sheila, Kamala, and Sunita has contributed in her own way to my work, and I am grateful to all three for their help in the preparation of this volume. Sheila ad- vised me regarding the format of the individual stanzas, and all of her recommendations were accepted. Kamala was particularly helpful during the study which preceded the undertaking of this project; she also discussed with me some of the theological is- sues raised by the poems. Sunita, too, was supportive, and en- couraged me in my study of the Śrīvaiṣṇava tradition. 
Above all, I want to express my gratitude to my husband, Baldev Raj. He meticulously and uncomplainingly edited the fi- nal draft of the manuscript. His perseverance as a research scholar and his ethic of hard work have been an inspiration to me. Ever encouraging throughout the long time of research and writing, he provided continuing support which is what enabled me to complete this project.

Introduction 
The well-known Visiṣṭādvaita philosopher-theologian Rāmānuja (c.1107-1137) is regarded by the members of his Śrīvaiṣṇava community as their chief intellectual leader and teacher (Acārya). Among the extant compositions of Rāmānuja's immediate disciples and Śrīvaiṣṇava contemporaries are ten praise-poems or stotras. Given the close relationship of their authors with Rāmānuja, one of the most important Hindu thinkers of all times, it is indeed surprising that until now only a few of these 716 stanzas have been translated into English. This present volume, then, consists of a translation of the complete stotra collection of the Acārya-philosopher's immediate disciple Kūresa (Tamil, Kūrattāļvān) -- referred to in the earliest hagiographical texts as Rāmānuja's favourite disciple -- and Kūresa's son, Parāśara Bhaṭṭar, who was one of Rāmānuja's immediate successors in an Acarya or guru line which extends up to the present day. Importantly, the stotra verses themselves substantiate Kūresa's close relationship with Rāmānuja, as well as Bhaṭṭar's position of leadership within the community of Śrīvaiṣṇavas centred in the Tamil-speaking area of South India --worshippers of the Supreme Lord Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa Who is eternally accompanied by His chief consort Śri-Laksmi. 
The word stotra (synonymous with the equally familiar terms stava and stuti) is derived from the Sanskrit verbal root stu meaning "to praise, to laud, to extol, to celebrate". Among the oldest of Hindu literary genres, its origins go back to the Rg Veda. Important in pan-Indian Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jain- ism, the stotra has played an especially important role in the devel- opment of the Śrīvaiṣṇava tradition. Kūresa's and Bhaṭṭar's sto- tras are particularly fascinating documents because, considered collectively, they are the first extant compositions that reveal the 
http://acharya.org

Praise-Poems to Vişņu and Śri 
distinctive Śrīvaiṣṇava world-view; indeed, they contain a unified theological vision based on an intricate and selective blending of the three streams of scripture sacred to Tamilian Vaiṣṇavas: (1) the Sanskrit Veda and its auxiliaries, the Śāstras, the Purāņas, and the Epics as interpreted by Rāmānuja, (2) the Tamil Veda, comprised of 4000 Tamil verses collectively known as Divya Prabandham, composed by twelve Vaiṣṇava devotees who lived from the 6th to the 10th century C.E. (ten of whom are referred to as Ālvārs, or "those immersed in God"), and (3) the Pāñcarātra Āgamas, San- skrit texts containing chapters on cosmology, meditation, iconog- raphy, and temple construction and ritual. 
Significantly, praise-poems or stotras are found in all three streams of Śrīvaiṣṇava scripture; therefore, they served as an ideal medium for the initial synthesis of these three strands during the crucial formative years of the tradition. Elements from all three streams of scripture, which form the theological foundation under- lying the stotras of Kūresa and Bhattar, appear therein as an INTEGRATED AND UNIFIED THEOLOGICAL VISION, as has been clearly demonstrated at some length in my in-depth analysis of the stotra collection entitled Poetry as Theology: The Sri- vaiṣṇava Stotra in the Age of Ramanuja (1992). The intensely emotional nature of the Alvar poets' devotion -- their unique con- tribution to Hindu religiosity (Hardy 1983) -- was assimilated into the Śrīvaiṣṇava community's Sanskrit literature through these early stotras composed during the very lifetime of Rāmānuja. The way in which categories and terminology from the Vedanta are joined with an emotional religiosity founded on the Alvārs is, in- deed, fascinating. 
The function of the ancient and important literary genre of the stotra is, however, multidimensional. Liturgically, the stotra ap- pears to have played an increasingly important role in Southern Vaiṣṇava temples, a development that must be connected with the emotional tenor of temple religion in the Tamil lands (Nayar 1992:22-23). Kūresa and Bhaṭṭar composed hymns dedicated to Vişņu's most beloved iconic incarnations, such as Lord Ranga (and His consort Śrī) of the Srirangam Temple in Tiruccirapalli, 
http://acharya.org 
Introduction

Lord Varadarāja at Kāñcīpuram, and Lord Sundara (Tamil, Alakar) of Alakar Kōyil outside the famous city of Madurai. In each case, these hymns are recited even today in their appropriate temples as an integral part of Vaiṣṇava temple ritual. Kūresa's en- tire hymnal, collectively referred to as Pañca Stava, is chanted monthly in the temple of his hometown of Kūram, a village not far from Kañcipuram. 
Śrīvaiṣṇavas regard stotra recitation as an effective means of obtaining boons, such as the cure of diseases, the birth of a son, the restoration of mental health, or even the attainment of knowl- edge. Bhaṭṭar's commentary on the "thousand names of Viṣṇu", which he identifies as a stotra, contains a lengthy explication of the efficacy of the chanting of the names of God, an efficacy which stotras as a genre are generally believed to possess. According to Bhaṭṭar, however, the stotra fulfills its function most distinctly when it is recited purely out of devotion, and for no ulterior pur- 
pose. 
The chanting of stotras as a form of personal devotion is an im- portant feature of Śrīvaiṣṇava spirituality. In this tradition of emotional devotion, the religious sentiments fostered by the chanting of praise-poems are certainly important. Yet the objec- tive efficacy of stotra recitation is equally significant. According to Visiṣṭādvaita epistemology, there are three means to valid knowledge (pramāṇa): direct perception (pratyakṣa), inference (anumāna), and verbal testimony (śabda). Recollection or remem- brance (smrti) is a. sub-category of perception. Among the exam- ples of recollection listed in the important Visiṣṭādvaita handbook called Yatindramata Dipikā is the spontaneous remembrance of previously-perceived sacred places, such as Śrīrangam, and the recollection of the lovely, divine, auspicious iconic form of Śri Venkatesa (divya-mangala-vigraha-smrti) while thinking deeply (1.19). Thus the recollection of particular iconic incarnations is, according to Śrīvaiṣṇava understanding, a form of the direct per- ception (pratyakṣa) of God. Correspondingly, among Śri- vaiṣṇavas an important function of the recitation of stotras, with their graphic descriptions both of God and His terrestrial dwelling

Praise-Poems to Vişņu and Śrī 
places, is the stimulation of the remembrance of particular iconic incarnations of Lord Visņu, leading to valid knowledge of God. 
The Stotras 
The stotras of Kūresa and Bhaṭṭar contain a wide variety of types of verses. Apart from the many stanzas of interest to students of Vaiṣṇava theology, there are verses that reveal something of the social milieu in which they were composed, and others that sub- stantiate hagiographical stories concerning their authors and Rāmānuja. Likewise, many stanzas give us a glimpse into the per- sonal religious experience and the deep devotion of their poet-au- thors. Because genres of biography and personal reminiscences were unknown to the Hindu literary world of the 11th-12th cen - turies, this, in itself, makes the stotras valuable documents. 
A basic understanding of the Śrīvaiṣṇava conception of God is necessary for the comprehension both of the structure and content of these poems of praise -- all celebrations of God's gracious con- descension and accessibility. One of the most distinctive features of Śrīvaiṣṇava theology is expressed in the doctrine of the five forms or modes (pañca-prakāra) of Viṣņu, no one of which is more fully God than the other: (1) Para is the Śrīvaiṣṇava techni- cal term for Vişņu Who, in His transcendent form, dwells in the Supreme Heaven of Vaikuntha; (2) Vyūhāvatāra denotes Vişņu's four-fold creative cosmic emanation; (3) Vibhavāvatāra is the term by which Śrīvaiṣṇavas refer to Vişņu's occasional incarnations limited to specific times and places, the most popular of Whom are Rāma and Kṛṣṇa; (4) Antaryāmin is Vişņu as Indweller of the entire cosmos, and especially as present in the human heart; and (5) Arcāvatāra, the central focus of Śrīvaiṣṇava devotion, is the technical term for Vişņu's incarnation as a worshippable icon. One especially significant feature of South Indian Vaisnavism is that each iconic incarnation has a unique identity which is at all times maintained.

Introduction 
Śrīvaikuntha Stava (ŚVS) 
5 
Regarded by Śrīvaiṣṇavas as Kūresa's earliest composition, Poem in Praise of Śrīvaikuntha, as its title suggests, is a eulogy of Vişņu's Highest Heaven called Vaikuntha. As such, it contains numerous stanzas in praise of God's supernal, transcendent form (para). Heavily influenced by the Upanisads and continuous both with the philosophical and devotional writings of Rāmānuja, its basic structure is the following: 
Kūresa lauds his Acārya Rāmānuja and Nammāļvār (vs. 1-3), offers introductory verses in praise of Viṣṇu and Vaikuntha, and bemoans his inability to adequately laud such lofty subjects (vs. 4- 10). 
Following the epistemology established by Ramanuja, Kūreśa considers the valid means to knowledge with reference to Vai- kuntha in vs. 11-18. Then, in the section extending from v. 19 to v. 38, Küreśa establishes Viṣṇu's essential lordship, citing a num- ber of Upanisadic statements, and refutes a variety of schools of thought regarding the nature of Viṣṇu's creatorship and His rela- tion to the world. 
In vs. 39-48, Kūresa extols Vişņu's Supreme Heaven known as Vaikuntha, and in vs. 49-64, following his Acarya Rāmānuja's philosophy of God, he praises the auspicious qualities of the Lord, and the specifics of His creatorship. He gives us a definition of liberation in v. 65. 
In the next fifteen verses, heavily influenced by Yamuna's Sto- tra Ratna and Ramanuja's Vaikuntha Gadya, the poet praises the beautiful form of the Lord, including His weapons, attendants and consorts. The remainder of the poem consists of passages of ex- traordinary self-abasement and reflections on the author's unwor- thiness. This lengthy section is followed by three concluding verses consisting of prayers invoking the Lord's protection.

Atimanuşa Stava (AMS) 
Praise-Poems to Vişņu and Śrī 
Poem in Praise of the Superhuman [Activities of God] consists of 61 stanzas extolling Visnu's occasional incarnations. Love of paradox, hinted at in Kūresa's other poems, is a central feature of this important and "typically Śrīvaiṣṇava" work, replete with hu- mour and irony. Kūresa's own enjoyment of the tension between the incomprehensibility and imperceptibility of Viṣṇu's supernal form and the vulnerability and radical accessibility visible in His many occasional incarnations forms the unifying feature of the poem. The poet's aim is less the exploration of the theological or philosophical implications of this tension than the relish of the po- larity inherent in God's essential nature: the very God Who is "completely invisible and unable to be apprehended by speech or mind" (v. 8) condescends to complete vulnerability as Kṛṣṇa, who was "bound with a rope" (vs. 36, 40), stole fresh butter in Vraja (v. 35), and became "a laughing stock for the cowherdesses” (v. 38). 
After a stanza introducing the topic of the stotra, Kūresa contin- ues his poem with several stanzas in praise of the Lord's iconic in- carnation in the Śrirangam Temple (vs. 2-4). The significance of this should not be overlooked. The stotras of Kūresa and Bhaṭṭar contain many stanzas which express a passionate longing for God's presence and for surrender to Him, stanzas uniformly di- rected to one or another of Viṣṇu's iconic incarnations. By way of contrast, stanzas in praise of God's occasional incarnations are considerably more restrained. Following the several passion-filled verses directed to the Lord at Srirangam -- God's most accessible form as arcāvatāra -- Kūresa's praise moves in typical Śrīvaiṣṇava style from the most accessible form to the least. Kūresa lauds Visņu's occasional incarnation (as Vamana in v. 5), His four-fold creative cosmic emanation in v. 6, and His transcendent form as Lord of Vaikuntha in vs. 7-8. 
In the theologically important stanzas 9-10, Kūresa explores the necessity for and wonder at God's accessibility in His various in-. carnations. Verses 11-16 include an unrelated variety of stories 
http://acharya.org 
Introduction

highlighting the accessibility of the Supreme Lord, leading to the large main section of the hymn. The poet delights in the paradox of Viṣṇu's incarnations as Rāma and Kṛṣṇa -- stanzas composed in a teasing mood (vs. 17-58). We see the devotee Kūresa at his best in these verses expressive of intimacy with God. The last three stanzas of the hymn's main section extol a variety of Viṣṇu's "superhuman" activities. Kūresa then concludes his poem with a three-stanza reflection on his helplessness and unworthiness be- fore God, taking courage only because of the Lord's unbounded compassion. 
Sundarabahu Stava (SBS) 
Of Kūresa's five stotras, Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord] has been most directly influenced by the Tamil poems of the Alvārs. Composed in Vanagiri (known in Tamil literature as Tirumaliruñcōlai) during a period of its author's separation from his Acārya Rāmānuja due to troubled times in Srirangam (vs. 129- 31), the poem contains translations into Sanskrit of numerous Tamil epithets of God and place. The very names Sundara and Sundarabahu are translations of the Tamil epithets Alakar and Cundarat toluṭaiyan, employed by several Āļvārs. 
Much of the general imagery and certain aspects of the structure of this praise-poem are based on the Ālvārs, as well. Numerous phrases, and in one instance an entire stanza (v. 92), are render- ings from the Tamil Ālvār poems. One reason for such heavy Āļvār influence is undoubtedly the fact that five Divya Praban- dham poets (Puttat Āļvār, Periyāļvār, Āṇṭāl, Tirumaṁkai Āļvār, and Nammāļvār) composed verses celebrating the beauty of this particular iconic incarnation of Viṣņu and His environs. 
After the initial verse of Sundarabahu Stava, in which the poet honours his Acarya Rāmānuja and establishes the poem's subject and purpose, Kūresa moves directly into the praise of the auspi- ciousness and loveliness of Lord Sundarabahu and His terrestrial dwelling place (vs. 2-13). Praise of the Lord through the extolling 
http://acharya.org

Praise-Poems to Viṣṇu and Śri 
of His Vanagiri abode continues on and off throughout the re- mainder of the stotra. Stanzas 24-32 laud the auspicious qualities of God, while His beauty is the special subject of vs. 33-38. A part-by-part description of the body of Sundara, starting with His head, begins in v. 39 and continues through v. 68. Here we see the frequent use of poetic metaphors common to both Sanskrit and Tamil love poetry. 
The consorts and attendants of the Lord in Vaikuntha are the subject of vs. 69-80, with special reference to the transcendent form of God (para), extending through v. 83. Beginning in v. 84, in a style similar to that of the Alvar hymns, Sundara is praised for having made Himself accessible in His various occasional incarna- tions. 
Sundara of Vanagiri is linked to the three main Śrīvaiṣṇava holy places of Venkata Mountain (Tirupati), Hastiśaila (Varadarāja Swami Temple in Kāñcīpuram), and Śrīrangam in vs. 117-19. The remaining stanzas consist of Küresa's reflections on his own unworthiness, the Lord's compassion, and a series of historically significant personal petitions to Lord Sundara. 
Varadaraja Stava (VRS) 
The 102 stanzas of Praise-Poem to the Boon-Bestower King are directed to the main icon in the Varadaraja Swami Temple, lo- cated in the famous temple town of Kañci. According to Śrīvaiṣṇava hagiography, the stotra was composed by Kūresa at the behest of his Acārya Rāmānuja as a means of requesting the restoration of Kūresa's vision, lost when he was blinded by a Śaiva king who was persecuting Vaisnavas. As the story has it, when Kūresa reached verse 23 he requested the Lord to provide divine (aprakṛta) vision by which he might see God's glory for- ever, and he was granted the ability to see Lord Varadaraja and Rāmānuja. (Kūresa himself refers to Lord Varadaraja as having restored the sight of "more than a hundred people" in SBS, v. 126.) 
http://acharya.org 
Introduction 
9 
The main epithets of both place and deity in this stotra are based on older Tamil names, even though the shrine itself was praised for certain only by a single Alvar, Puttat, in two verses addressed to "the One Who dwells in Attiyur" (see n. 1). According to local legend, the site of Varadaraja Swami Temple in Kañci is associ - ated both with the elephants that Hindus believe to be the guardians of the four directions -- which are said to have wor- shipped Visņu on the very spot where the temple was later con- structed -- and with the lord of elephants Gajendra, much loved by the Āļvārs. Kūresa frequently refers to the sacred site as Hastigiri/ Karigiri (Elephant Hill or Hill of the Elephant(s). Replete with imagery common to both Sanskrit and classical Tamil love poetry, Varadaraja Stava contains many stanzas important to the under- standing of Śrīvaiṣṇavism's theology of incarnation. 
Vs. 1-14 celebrate the visible presence on Elephant Hill of the Supreme Lord about Whom the Vedas speak. Beginning in v. 15, Kūresa moves on to the praise of Vişņu's four-fold creative cos- mic emanation (vyūhāvatāra) (vs. 15-16), and the Lord's innumer- able auspicious qualities (vs. 17-20). The main section of the poem consists of a forty-two verse celebration of Lord Varadarã- ja's loveliness, including a part-by-part head-to-foot description, based on imagery from the Alvārs and classical Sanskrit court poetry similar to that contained in Sundarabahu Stava, vs. 39-68. 
A number of verses follow in which the poet expresses a sense of wonder at the Lord's need for, and dependence upon, His devotees. In his own typical fashion, Kūresa poignantly reflects upon his own unworthiness and sinfulness (vs. 72-88). In the final verses, he combines praise of the Lord's unbounded compassion with three stanzas concerning an unnamed petition (vs. 89-91), an expression of surrender to the Lord founded on His great mercy (vs. 91-92, 94-95), and the request to be forever His servant (vs. 96, 98). Kūresa's final resort in his appeal for God's mercy is his relationship with his teacher Rāmānuja, a member of the illustrious line of Śrīvaiṣṇava Acāryas, at whose feet he has taken refuge (v. 102).

Praise-Poems to Vişņu and Śri 
Śri Stava (ŚS) 
Kūresa's Praise-Poem to [the Goddess] Śri consists of only eleven stanzas. Chronologically, this poem stands midway be- tween the short compositions in her praise by Kūresa's predeces- sors (Yamuna's Catuḥ Śloki and Rāmānuja's short laudation of Śrī in his Śaraṇāgati Gadya) and his son Bhattar's longer and much more elaborate hymn to the Goddess called Śrī Guņa Rat- nakosa. Yamuna's and Rāmānuja's influence can be felt in almost every verse of Kūresa's praise-poem. 
Supplemented by the stanzas referring to Śrī scattered through- out Kūresa's other stotras and by Bhattar's poem addressed to the Goddess mentioned above, Śrī Stava provides us with a good un- derstanding of the Śrīvaiṣṇava view of Śri at the time of the early Ācāryas. 
Śrirangaraja Stava: The First Hundred Stanzas (SRRS I) 
Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam I, the first of Bhattar's stotras treated here, is directed to the main icon of the great Srirangam Temple located near the modern city of Tiru- cirappalli. During the time of the Alvārs, Srirangam was already an important centre of Vaiṣṇava worship, and Nathamuni, first in the lineage of Śrīvaiṣṇava Acaryas, is said to have resided there. 
Bhattar's stotra is unique among the poems of the early Acāryas in that it clearly depicts the temple layout, built according to the ar- chitectural requirements of the Pañcarātra Āgamas. Bhattar praises the temple's landscape before entering the temple proper and then, verse-by-verse, engages in a laudatory description of each shrine that he passes as he makes his way to the Inner Sanc- tum. Śrīrangarāja Stava is recited before the main icon in the Śrirangam Temple on festive occasions such as Brahmotsava. 
The recitation of taniyans ("solitary" verses) in praise of the Āļvārs and Acāryas, strung together to form a guru-parampara or listing of the lineage of preceptors, is a required part of daily

Śrīvaiṣṇava spiritual practice. Customarily, one begins with one's own Acārya, one's Acārya's Acārya and so forth through the most revered teachers, such as Rāmānuja, Yāmuna, Nathamuni, and Nammāļvār, through Visvaksena and Śrī, clear up to Lord Viṣṇu Himself. While the official guru-parampara does not ap- pear to have been formalized until after Bhattar's time, he gives us a virtual listing in vs. 1-12 of the poem: his father Kūresa (v. 1), followed by his Ācārya Empār, Rāmānuja, Yamuna, Nāthamuni, Nammālvār, the Goddess Śri, and the Lord Himself. This section is followed by eight verses in which the poet bemoans his inability to adequately praise the Lord. With v. 21, Bhaṭṭar begins a twelve-verse eulogy of the environs of Lord Ranga's terrestrial abode, including several lovely descriptions of the island-town of Śrirangam and the Kāverī River which surrounds it. 
As Bhattar begins his entry into the temple proper (v. 32), he honours the leaders stationed in each of the four directions who guard the temple from its outermost wall, and praises the temple as a whole in vs. 33-36. Beginning with v. 37, Bhaṭṭar salutes the gatekeepers in order to gain their permission to enter the temple (a custom followed by devotees even today), and then celebrates various parts of the complex, including the thousand-pillared hall and the lotus pool. In v. 41, as he approaches the shrine of the Alvārs, the poet asks these "ten persons" to take pity on him. Af- ter several more verses in praise of temple and town, he reaches the figure of Narasimha, and from there proceeds on to the shrine of the Acaryas (v. 48). 
As Bhattar nears the Inner Sanctum, he praises the many atten- dants of the Lord that he sees along the way (vs. 50-57). The In- ner Sanctum and the Lord's and Śrī's ladies-in-waiting are de- scribed and extolled in vs. 58-62. The remainder of the stotra is comprised of verses in praise of Viṣṇu's and Śrī's iconic incarna- tions Who dwell within the Inner Sanctum. The beauty of the ut- the smaller, portable icon of the standing Lord used in festive temple processions -- is extolled in vs. 63-74, while the remaining verses praise the mula-bera -- the well-known immov-

Śrīrangarāja Stava: The Latter Hundred Stanzas (ŚRRS II) 
61 
Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrīrangam II is the most philosophical of the early Śrīvaiṣṇava stotras. After a gen- eral praise of Śruti and Smrti (vs. 1-4), Bhaṭṭar begins a series of occasionally humorous refutations of various philosophical schools of the Hindu, Buddhist, and Jaina traditions (vs. 5-16). Having reviewed the valid means to knowledge according to Visiṣṭādvaita philosophy (vs. 17-26), Bhattar begins his praise of Lord Visņu's auspicious qualities, including verses which care- fully define each of the Lord's famous "six qualities". 
Beginning with the inaccessible and imperceptible transcendent God and moving through His increasingly accessible forms (in contrast to the structure of Kūresa's AMS), Bhattar praises the transcendent Lord para in vs. 33-37 and Vişņu's four-fold cre- ative cosmic emanation (vs. 39-40). After several verses on the creation of the universe (vs. 41-44), he moves to the praise of Vişnu's occasional incarnations and His accessibility as expressed in a variety of His earthly activities (vs. 45-73). 
Important in the theology of arcavatāra, v. 74 forms a link be- tween the verses celebrating Vişņu's occasional incarnations and His incarnations as a temple icon (with special reference to Lord Śriranga). Beginning with v. 83, Bhattar reviews the variety of means to reach the Lord. The power of the Lord to effect the union of the "surrendered" devotee with Himself is celebrated in vs. 87-89, where Bhattar calls the Lord both "the means and the goal". The poet concludes with several verses of supplication and self-abasement which, at the same time, celebrate the Lord's pa- tience and compassion.

Śri Guna Ratnakosa (ŚGRK) 
In Jewel-Treasury of Śrï's Auspicious Qualities, a companion- piece to Śrīrangarāja Stava, Bhaṭṭar directs most of his stanzas to Śrī's iconic incarnation in the Śrirangam Temple. From a purely literary point of view, ŚGRK is perhaps the most attractive of the early Śrīvaiṣṇava stotras. Theologically, too, it is the most impor- tant of the early compositions on the Goddess Śri, for it contains (in more elaborate form than in the works of Yamuna, Rāmānuja, or Kūresa) the several elements which converge in the doctrine of Śrī as the essential mediator (puruṣakāra) between the Lord and 
souls. 
Bhaṭṭar takes refuge with Śrī, and praises her for her role in the creation, preservation, and dissolution of the worlds in the first two verses of the poem. Śri is then lauded for enriching the love- liness of her husband (v. 3) and for being the very basis of His supremacy (the later tradition calls this the doctrine of śrī-patitva). In vs. 5-8, according to the custom in Sanskrit stotra poetry, Bhaṭṭar laments his inability to laud Śrī appropriately, and pleads for her inspiration so that he might complete his praise-poem to her. Much of Śri Guņa Ratnakośa expresses the centrality of Śrī to the Śrīvaiṣṇava world-view; indeed, scripture itself is said to have as one of its main purposes the acclamation of the Goddess (for example, vs. 10, 12-14). Śrī's powerful glance -- the good- ness that it brings, and the deprivation that arises from its absence -- is a theme of many stanzas (for example, vs. 15-18). The very creation of Vişņu's Supreme Heaven and all the worlds are said to be solely for Śri's pleasure (vs. 19-22). Bhaṭṭar then extols Śri as Mistress of the Supreme Heaven of Vaikuntha, and praises her relationship with Viṣṇu and their inherent inseparability (vs. 23- 31). 
In v. 32, Bhaṭṭar begins the praise of the auspicious qualities of the Supreme Couple, employing a variety of epithets in the voca- tive case, specifically mentioning Śri's iconic incarnation in Śrirangam. He appears thoroughly to enjoy comparing and con-

Praise-Poems to Visņu and Śrī 
trasting the auspicious qualities of the masculine Lord Ranga and the feminine Śri in vs. 33-37. 
Icon-makers are required to memorize v. 38, a description of Śrī in a sitting posture, because it gives the idea of how an icon of Laksmi must look (as she appears in Vaikuntha) when wor- shipped independently. Several of the stanzas which follow are the first in the tradition to highlight the erotic relationship between Vişņu and Śrī, its enjoyment by the devotees, and its relation to Śri's role as mediator between the Lord and souls (vs. 40-47). These verses draw heavily on the images of Sanskrit love poetry. 
The relish that the devotee has for the presence of Viṣṇu along with Śrī, as well as their eternal inseparability which extends to Vişņu's descents to earth in incarnational form, is expressed in v. 48. The poet then praises several of these occasional incarnations (vs. 49-55). Bhaṭṭar concludes his poem with a celebration of the most beloved of all the Supreme Couple's forms, their incarnation in a worshippable temple icon (vs. 56-61). 
Aṣṭā Śloki (AS) 
Eight Ślokas is included in most published Śrīvaiṣṇava stotra collections. While stylistically the work resembles a stotra insofar as it is written in Sanskrit poetic verse and its final stanza is di- rected to the Lord, content-wise it is the forerunner of the impor- tant Śrīvaiṣṇava literary genre called the rahasya-grantha composed mostly in Maṇipravāļa, a synthetic form of Sanskritized Tamil, in explication of the three main Śrīvaiṣṇava mantras. 
11 
texts 
While the three mantras are given to every Śrīvaiṣṇava during the initiation ceremony of pañca-saṁskāra, and their recitation is performed daily by members of the community, their elaborate meanings are taught only to those who express a desire to delve more deeply into the spiritual life. Because the meaning of Bhaṭṭar's Aṣṭā Śloki can best be ascertained in the light of the later rahasya-grantha commentaries, it has been suggested that

this cryptic poem is a summary of a pre-existing oral tradition (Mumme 1987:12). 
Vs. 1-4 consist of an explication of the tiru-mantra: "Aum namo nārāyaṇāya" or "AUM! Homage to Nārāyaṇa!". Vs. 5-6 explain the meaning of the dvaya-mantra: “śrīman nārāyaṇa caraṇau saraṇaṁ prapadye, śrīmate nārāyaṇāya namaḥ" or "I take refuge in/with the feet of Nārāyaṇa Who is [eternally united] with Śrī. Homage to Nārāyaṇa Who is [eternally united] with Śri". Vs. 7-8 explain the carama-śloka, the words uttered by Kṛṣṇa (to Arjuna) in Bhagavad Gītā 18:66: "sarvadharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ saraṇaṁ vraja, ahaṁ tvā sarvapāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ”, or "Having relinquished all dharmas, resort to me alone as refuge; I will release you from all sins. Do not grieve". 
Śrīranganatha Stotra (ŚRNS) 
The brief work called Praise-Poem to the Lord [of the Uni- verse] at Śrīrangam appears to have been composed by Bhaṭṭar when he was away from his beloved home of Śrirangam. Several of its verses express the poet-Acarya's longing to see Lord Ranga once again (vs. 3-5). Interestingly, v. 8 confirms the hagiographical story of Rāmānuja's visit to North India. 
Text, Translation and Notes 
This translation of the stotras of Kūresa and Bhaṭṭar is based on the edition of their works contained in Stotramālā, edited by the Acāryas of Kāñci and published most recently in 1969. This edition is the most accessible to Śrīvaiṣṇavas today. Until as recently as the last century, original copies of the Acaryas' manuscripts were destroyed by fire or put into a river after a copy was made by a son or grandson. This procedure was not regarded as a destruction of the manuscript; rather, revered manuscripts were consigned to water or fire (both regarded by Hindus as pure 
http://acharya.org 
16 
Praise-Poems to Visņu and Śri 
elements) in order to prevent them from being mishandled or treated disrespectfully. In spite of this, however, a critical edition of the stotras has been deemed unnecessary for several reasons. 
The Śrīvaiṣṇava community, close-knit and geographically well-defined, has an unbroken line of preceptors dating from its first Acārya Nathamuni (c. 10th century C.E.). Most of its litera- ture (other than the philosophical commentaries of Rāmānuja) until recently remained unknown to, and unread by, those outside the community. The problem of widely diverging redactions with dif- ferences reflecting social class or geographical region -- as exists in the case of popular pan-Indian texts such as the Epics and Purāņas -- is non-existent in the early Śrīvaiṣṇava sectarian litera- ture. This is undoubtedly due to the fact that the texts were re- stricted to a small community with a relatively cohesive world- view (inspite of the later divisions within the community). Fur- thermore, the first printed editions of many Śrīvaiṣṇava texts (including the stotras) were made by traditional scholars beginning in the 19th century. At that time, most available manuscripts were consulted; in fact, the printed editions themselves often contain variant readings. The text of Stotramālā was in each case com- pared with the other extant published editions (see bibliography), but because only two discrepancies were of any theological signif- icance, I have chosen not to refer to the variant readings in the notes except in these two instances. With respect to all other stan- zas, I believe that the comparison of variant readings would create an unnecessary complication in these already complicated texts. 
The Translation 
Certain difficult decisions must be made in the preparation of any translation. The non-technical and fluid language of the stotra poems can be particularly problematic. I have mostly been con- cerned with the lucidity of the overall meaning of each stanza, rather than with the literal emulation of Sunskrit grammar. In places, words or phrases, especially compounds, have been rather 
http://acharya.org 
Introduction 
17 
loosely translated in order to avoid awkward constructions, which may be found to be frustrating to readers in English. While avail- able commentaries were sometimes consulted in order to establish the correct prose order of the verses, in some instances stanzas have been reconstructed in order to allow for a somewhat more natural flow to the English language. Hopefully, this has made for a translation that will appeal to an audience beyond Sanskritists and academics specializing in Hinduism who can, in any case, consult the original text. 
It has been my intention to translate the verses, especially those which are renderings of Alvar phraseology, imagery and emotion, according to Śrīvaiṣṇava idiom. The particular format for the translated verses, which was recommended by Sheila Nayar, was adopted not because I believe that the translations themselves would qualify as "poetry" (many would certainly not), but because the breaking up of the verses into small units makes for a clarity and readabilty not found in many stotra translations up to now. 
The Notes 
Notes to individual stanzas are to be found at the end of each stotra; the endnote numbers correspond to the stanza numbers. I have made every effort to identify antecedents of the verses, in- cluding phrases and epithets from the Sanskrit Veda, the composi- tions of Ramanuja, the hymns of the Aļvārs, and the Pāñcarātra Agamas. The stotras contain many Upanisadic phrases and epi- thets; particularly well-known phrases or epithets (especially if contained in numerous Upanisads) have not been identified in the notes. For the identification or explanation of Sanskrit words and the names and epithets of deities, persons, and places, the reader 
may refer to the Glossary.

and an auspicious asylum

the divine abode of Acyuta

dependent upon Whom 
are the heavenly abodes 
Who is lotus-eyed, 
without a second, knowable by Vedanta, 
and beginningless!

May I see that Indescribable One Who 
wears a golden garment 
casts sidelong glances, boon-bestowing and cool 
has hands reaching down to His knees 
is black like a cloud

the Invisible One

on the summit of the Vedas (Upaniṣads) 
and on the heads of the Lord's exalted servants

falls within the range of speech 
of even people like me 
because of [the Lord's] motherly affection 
toward those who have taken refuge with Him!

Though fully aware of my own [ignorance] 
I shamelessly utter words of affection 
to the feet of Viṣṇu! 
No one calls the water [of a sacred river] impure if lapped by a dog, 
nor need the dog feel ashamed when overcome by thirst! 
9 
The magnitude of the qualities of the demon-destroyer God transcends speech and thought. 
Just a tiny particle from those (qualities] would pacify my torment, 
[for] even a drop of water from the ocean is sufficient [to satisfy] 
a thirsty insect! 
10 
Men of ancient times 
whose ecstatic speech was tender with love have praised You with mellifluous words O Enemy of Madhu! 
My lowly speech 
[seems to make] a mockery of their [sweet] sayings.

On the other hand, 
Your forgiveness will find an object in my harsh language!

Your revered commandment 
known as the Three Vedas 
is accepted as the valid means to knowledge 
of the supra-sensual, 
while other means 
[such as perception and inference] are faulty and [therefore] fallacious. 
But the eternal [Triad] 
is praised as flawless! 
12 
You are a hidden treasure for ALL people, obtainable by the meritorious 
but difficult to reach for others! 
The virtuous performers of meritorious deeds accepted the Triad in this matter, 
but others 
by practicing things contrary to the Vedas have fallen down [into viewpoints] 
which fail to recognize Vedic authority.

of wicked people

What is the difference between 
those who seek out a mirage [in the desert

but are killed by crocodiles? 
Alas! [There is no difference!] 
Both those who deny the authority of the Vedas and the followers of wrong philosophies 
derived from it 
go to limitless terrible darkness, 
[for] You do not 
cast Your glance 
on [either of] them. 
15 
In the very same way that an object 
may be clearly seen [only] in the sunlight, 
so those with minds made flawless 
by devotion to You 
discern the meaning of Śruti 
[using] acceptable aids such as logic and Smṛti sent forth by You to elucidate the Vedas.

Those devoid of devotion to Your lotus-feet

We determine that You alone are the Supreme Lord a truth disclosed by hundreds of Vedic statements 
which have as their chief aim 
the exposition of reality, 
by the power of Smṛtis 
which conform [to the Vedas], 
by true Purāņas 
given to the exposition of the truth, 
and by the wisdom of the knowers of the Lord.

Elsewhere some people accept 
the popular understanding of [the epithet] "Isa" (lord) 
and declare that [Śiva] is Lord. 
They accept the Three Vedas 
only in order to endow mere public opinion

But with You, O Imperishable One, 
the Triad is direct!

We pronounce You -- such as You are -- Supreme Lord 
You Who are denoted by the syllable "A" which is the root of the sacred syllable AUM, 
the very essence of the Vedas. 
20 
You are the Lord of souls. 
There is no Lord other than You. You are the Overlord of the universe and its Final Goal. 
O Nārāyaṇa! O Imperishable One! You alone are the transcendent God! Even Brahma and the other [gods] have obtained their very existence by Your glance. 
21 
You are the Eternal One, 
without equal or superior, Exalted Glory, 
the Ancient Man 
living in the eternal and undecaying heaven, 
the Generator of life, 
and the Ground of this world. 
O Supporter of the earth! 
The Vedas celebrate You alone! 
22 
You are that thousand-headed man Whom they call the Lord 
http://acharya.org 
Poem in Praise of Śrivaikuntha 
of past, present and future, and the One having no ruler [over Him]. 
Your abode is on the ocean, Your forms are limitless, and Your Queen is Laksmi 
Mother of the three worlds. 
23 
In conformity with all the Srutis, 
Puruşa Sūkta 
which is the purifier of the whole world 
and faultless like You 
described You 
Who are steadfast, unshakeable, 
and the bearer of the 
title of Nārāyaṇa 
as Supreme Person and Lord. 
24 
That lordly bliss which [Sruti] has described as hundred-fold in sequential order [is comparable] to Your own [bliss] only if finally multiplied 
beyond [the range of] speech and mind. 
You, the Lotus-eyed One and the Person in the Sun, are here among the people a 
the Inner Soul! 
25 
That which is regarded as the root cause [of all things] -- 
and is known 
in the [Upanisadic] statements on creation 
as "Brahman" or 
"Sat"

26 
Śrīvaikuntha Stava 
by the word Atman, or as Tat -- Mahopanisad proclaims to be 
Nārāyaṇa. 
[Other Upanisads] beginning with Subāla have also followed this [same tradition]. 
26 
What is understood in the Śrutis as 
the Supreme Light 
the Highest Truth 
the Supreme Soul Brahman 
and the Highest Entity 
one Upanisad calls "Nārāyaṇa" 
and another "the supreme status of Vişņu”. 
27 
Thus thousands of Upanisadic statements proclaim Your supreme essential lordship. 
Moreover, while traversing the worlds 
swallowing them 
and spitting them out again, You didn't even take notice 
of the difference between 
a [tiny] insect and [the great lord] Brahmā! 
28 
The wise ones determine Your essential lordship by the glory of Your form 
by Your Supreme Abode 
by some of Your wonderful, appropriate deeds 
and by other undisputed marks 
[indicative of Your supremacy].

It is [well-known] to all people that she whose sidelong glance perpetually determines the sovereignty 
of lords [like Brahma and Śiva] is [named] Śri. 
People of eloquent speech 
derive the etymology [of the name Śri 
from the fact that] 
she has taken refuge with You, 
and call you the śrī of Śrī!

Despite the existence of Śruti, 
on account of their adamant and baseless logic, some skeptics become deaf toward You 
because of māyā's power.

That māyā created by You out of the three gunas - what amusement does it not provide for You, O All-Pervading One? 
31 
O Storehouse of eternal, blemishless, spotless, changeless, auspicious, true qualities!

that You are constantly being born variously in [the form of] inanimate objects and worms, butterflies, elephants and other [creatures]!

This entire universe is manifested 
because of Your glance 
and were You not to cast Your glance 
it would not appear at all. 
It desires Your glance 
in order to remain [in existence]. 
Thus in Śruti You alone 
are referred to as the "world". 
O Lord! 
33 
Śruti has decreed Your sovereignty such that the name like the form 
-- 
of all things moving and non-moving 
is dependent upon You alone. 
Alas! 
For sinners 
this is a cause of delusion 
regarding You! 
34 
Various [people] who are 
even slight and momentary 
recipients even of a fraction of Your glance 
have acquired a dominion 
[otherwise] unobtainable by humans. 
Whichever [gods] have spoken of Your Supreme essential lordliness [are themselves called lords] in the Śrutis 
on account of their association with Your glory. 
http://acharya.org 
Poem in Praise of Śrivaikuntha 
35 
Some deluded ones think that 
the variety of eternal things 
is by its essential nature 
independent of You 
and so they speak of Your sovereignty as limited. 
But the Three Vedas declare 
Your dominion uncircumscribed! 
All things exist 
36 
because of Your will alone. 
Some things 
forever dear to You 
are eternal. 
[Among these] eternals Your auspicious qualities 
are indeed a [good] example for us 
[because] it is certain that 
their inherent nature is one of 
eternal dependence on You alone. 
37 
You are not only 
the Cause of this universe 
comprised of sentient beings (cit) 
and insentient objects (acit), 
O Imperishable One, 
but also its Effect! 
[Thus] the Upanisads forcefully proclaim 
Your immutability 
[as the quality] which reveals 
the limitlessness of Your essential lordliness.

Those who understand [the meaning of] Śruti know that your divine glory is incomprehensible without indulging in unfounded arguments [which include such questions as]:

taking what [as the material]? 
and to what end 
does the Lord create all this?" 
The Cosmic Egg

for Your sport!

Created by Your own will for Your action of sport, these [eggs] represent 
a minuscule fraction of an iota of Your glory. 
Your Supreme Eternal Realm 
is ever changeless

as the resplendent [state of] union with the Lord, which is directly perceptible [by liberated souls] and is the most highly revered of all places, [the wise ones] proclaim as 
Your Abode called Vaikuntha. 
43 
Phrases such as "with form" 
"with multitudes of true qualities" 
"with noble and sweet thoughts" 
"with greatness" and "with the highest wealth" 
when used to describe [the Eternal Realm as being] 
"like this" [or] "like that" 
show disrespect for the glory [of Vaikuntha]. 
44 
On account of the greatness of that which is eternal and unacquainted with changes like growth, decay and destruction, the fruit of ritual actions 
- impermanent and resulting in sorrow -- is mentioned in the Śrutis as insignificant.

That [place] which can be reached by the pure, 
by those who have transcended changes 
like birth and old age, 
by those who possess 
the wealth of abundant devotion, and by those who are not attached 
to worldly existence, and cannot even be imagined 
by other less-fortunate ones, [the wise ones] proclaim as Your Abode called Vaikuntha! 
46 
The supreme greatness 
of Your limitless Eternal Realm is established as independent of anyone other than You. 
Multitudes of qualities 
beginning with knowledge have crossed beyond all limits! 
Your beloved Lakṣmi 
and Your important attendants 
such as the king of the birds (Garuḍa) [dwell there]. 
47 
Your countless, limitless, true auspicious qualities 
are such that even if one were to possess 
a minuscule fraction of a bit 
of a single quality from among them, the resultant glory would transcend speech and mind. 
http://acharya.org 
Poem in Praise of Śrīvaikuntha 
Yet You are One Whose glory is independent [of these qualities]! 
48 
[People who are considered great are judged so] 
on account of their qualities. 
Some gain respect 
because of worldly power. 
O All-pervading One, 
with You it is precisely the contrary! 
Your power and qualities attain auspiciousness on account of their association with You! 
49 
The Three Vedas declare You to be 
without qualities 
because You are untouched by 
the material constituents 
of purity, passion, and ignorance. 
O Hari! 
They proclaim You 
the Supreme Lord of lords 
because You are an Eternal Ocean 
of all true qualities! 
50 
They say that knowledge itself 
is Your essential nature 
and also that knowledge is Your attribute 
in the same way that a gem made of lustres has lustre itself as its quality.

Therefore, [having knowledge as a quality], You perceive the entire universe directly, and its protection is accomplished solely by means of Your glance. 
51 
By declaring in sequential order 
"Those which are one hundred [times bliss]..." the Three Vedas attempted to delimit Your bliss which is augmented by 
streams of Your qualities 
beginning with youthfulness. 
Ultimately they proclaimed [Your bliss] to be beyond the range of speech and mind! 
52 
Thus the ingenious [Triad] declared that the great majesty of all Your limitless glories 
along with all Your auspicious qualities beginning with youthfulness 
is beyond the range of speech. 
53 
Oh! What a wonder! 
By Your wonderful action 
at the time of the dissolution [of the worlds], controlling according to its appropriate merits the entire undifferentiated [universe] 
which was ignorant 
and without knowledge of past experience, You instantaneously effected its reappearance by Your vow to glance [in its direction] at once, [causing it to become] differentiated 
from a [tiny] insect 
clear up to [the great lord] Brahmā. 
http://acharya.org

54 
Such is Your limitless lordly power that with that selfsame glance 
You set in motion the wonderful universe which ever moves toward appearance 
growth, decay, and dissolution [and is differentiated by] 
moving beings and non-moving things and also lords and beggars! 
55 
Since You are able to create the universe 
destroy it, change it, make it non-existent 
and determine change as to its form and nature, why do you take into account the law of karma [when the wise ones] declare 
Your lordly autonomy indisputable? 
56 
They speak of Your splendour as darkening the brightness of the thousand-rayed [sun] 
which collects together (its rays] 
at the time of dissolution [of the universe]. 
Your perpetually playful and ravishing brilliance is ever well-disposed 
toward those well-disposed to You 
and is terrifying to [all] others! 
57 
[All] creatures are dependent upon Your glance for their very existence, 
so You are already the possessor of everything! 
I [can't] imagine another as munificient as You!

caused by sins arising from latent impressions [resulting] from birth after birth 
in this beginningless transitory existence, solely out of compassion 
You have prescribed in the Sastras 
[the means for ] the expiation of those sins. 
59 
The spiritual well-being 
which You fashion for Your creatures 
by the eternal Śāstras 
by Smṛtis 
by the deeds of Your divine incarnations and by Your auspicious glance 
is a wealth of bounding billows 
belonging to the Most Excellent Ocean 
that is Your compassion!

What is this sin of inconceivable potency incessantly and constantly present in creatures 
who have not fashioned for themselves 
a fortunate destiny

the ocean of Your compassion

61 
Here [in this transitory world] 
a creature commits in half a moment sin [the effect of which is] inexhaustible even after the experience [of suffering] lasting for millions of eons. 
Ah! How wonderful it is 
that You always forgive such a sinner 
in all [sorts of] births 
solely because of a mere intention to stop [sinning]. 
62 
How could so great a forgiveness fail 
toward those who have a protective armour 
in the form of hands folded 
in supplication to You? 
And how can Your forgiveness 
be regarded as an auspicious quality 
[when it proceeds] on its own 
without distinction 
toward all creatures zealously eager 
for Your motherly affection? 
63 
When You [heard] the trumpeting 
of the best among elephants [Gajendra], You Who created the universe by a mere thought 
caused it to flourish, 
and then desired to destroy it, 
http://acharya.org 
38 
wanted to come [to him] 
and stroke his foot! 
Śrīvaikuntha Stava 
What do you mean by surrendering 
to such [feelings of] motherly affection? 
64 
Oh how wonderful! 
If any creature in this transitory existence might worship the Lord ever so slightly 
with an undivided mind, 
You accept him on par with Garuḍa 
even without knowing that 
"He is [like] this, 
He is endowed with such-and-such qualities, He is thus-and-so"! 
65 
You bestow upon those who have resorted to You 
form and qualities such as glory 
that are equal to Your own. 
Some therefore say that liberation is 
identity with You. 
[But] in the highest considered opinion 
of the learned 
liberation is only 
servitude to You! 
Be that as it may!

Oh, what [a wonder that 
You take on ] the nature and qualities

With Your conduct dependent on [Your devotee and becoming] similar in qualities with him, You embrace him!

O God! For a hundred autumns 
may we see You like this -- 
resembling a mountain of black collyrium having a prominent and attractive nose 
long eyes, long-stretching ears 
victorious arms [reaching down] to the knees

traversed the three worlds, which is is a head ornament

my head for a long time?

Ah! When will You fulfill my desires 
by placing on my head 
the fine and tender young leaf of Your hand 
which resembles a veined lotus

Ah! The natural beauty of Your body alone is ever enough!

NOTES 
This stanza has become the official guru-parampară (lineage of Acāryas) verse in praise of Rāmānuja. As such, it is re- cited by all Śrīvaiṣṇavas, whether Tenkalais (Southern School) or Vatakalais (Northern School). 
References to the Lord's and Śri's "sidelong glance" (ikṣaṇa or katākṣa) abound in Śrīvaiṣṇava praise-poems. Regarded in both Sanskritic and Tamilian culture as the "look of love", God's sidelong glance -- a glance from the corner of His eye -- connotes the passionate nature of His relationship with His devotees (as their Beloved), as well as the power of His glance. A straightforward glance or direct gaze would overwhelm the devotee.

This verse mentions several mahā-puruṣa-lakṣaṇas, or signs of a great man: long arms reaching to the knees, long ears, a broad chest, and so forth. 
Vişņu is frequently referred to as "the bearer of Lakṣmi" (Lakṣmidhara), synonymous with His better-known name Śridhara. Theologically, this name is particularly significant for Śrīvaiṣṇavas: "Just as the gem bears its lustre, and the flower its fragrance... Viṣṇu bears Laksmi by an inherent [eternal] relationship" (see Bhaṭṭar, BhGD, No. 617). "clan" (gotra), "class" (varṇa). 
"the water [of a sacred river]" (tirtham). The word "river" is implied in the verse due to the fact that other forms of water (such as water in a pot) would, indeed, become impure if licked by a dog. 
"Of the demon-destroyer god" (devasya daitya-mathanasya) refers to Vişņu, Who is well-known as Madhujit and 
Madhusudhana. For an extended etymological explanation of these epithets referring to Vişnu's role as the destroyer of demons, see Bhattar, BhGD, No. 210. 
Visiṣṭādvaita philosophy recognizes three means to valid knowledge: perception, inference, and verbal (primarily scriptural) testimony. Because Vişņu's Supreme Heaven transcends perception by the senses, the Vedas alone (referred to here as trayi or Triad) can give us knowledge of 
it. 
PSV notes the following concerning "the meaning of 
words": Nyaya teaches that a sentence carries meaning over and above the meanings of its individual words. The signif- icance in the context of this verse is that some people accept Śruti in principle, and discern the meaning of its individual words, but interpret its overall meaning wrongly; that is, they accept Śruti but not its overall meaning that Visņu is the Supreme God. 
"Limitless terrible darkness" (aparaṁ ghoram tamas) is a poetic expression for hell (naraka), "a place of torment for the wicked where souls go before being reborn" (M-W, 520).

In this verse and v. 16, Kūresa clearly follows his Ācārya Rāmānuja's teaching on the relationship between devotion and knowledge. See Rāmānuja, VS, para. 144. 
This verse is a continuation of v. 15. 
51 
In this stanza, Kūresa enunciates the view of his Acārya Rāmānuja called satkhyātivāda, or the theory of reality- apprehension. Rāmānuja reduces all the other five theories of perception (including akhyāti or non-apprehension, atmakhyāti, or self-perception, anirvacaniya-khāyti, or indefinable perception, anyathakhayti, or misperception, and asatkhyāti or non-being's perception) to two: an object which is manifest to consciousness through perception either corresponds completely to the thing as it is in reality (yathartha) or it does not. Rāmānuja's ŚrīBh deals with a number of exceptions which apparently contradict this realistic theory of perception, one being the yellow ap- pearance of white things to the jaundiced eye: "But in the (perception of the) yellow conch and other such things (by the jaundiced eye), the ocular rays combined with the bilious substance existing in the eye, are brought into association with the conch and other such things. The whiteness be- longing to the conch is not apprehended, because it is over- powered by the yellow colour belonging to the bile. Hence, as in the case of the conch-shell covered with gold, there is a perception that the conch is yellow. The bilious substance, and the yellow colour belonging to it, are very subtle and are not therefore apprehended by the bystanders. But, by him who is (thus) afflicted with biliousness, they are, though subtle, apprehended well, because they have proceeded from his own eyes...." (ŚrīBh I.1.1.1, p.167). This and all other excerpts from ŚriBh are based on the translation by M. Rangacharya and M.B. Varadaraja Iyengar, unless otherwise indicated. 
In this verse, Küreśa, following Rāmānuja, links "the ap- prehension or knowledge of the thing as it is" (yathārtha- bodha) with devotion to the lotus-feet of the Lord (anghri- sarasi-ruha-bhakti). Devotion, which is likened to a bile- killing ointment, is the remedy for faulty apprehension.

Vs. 17-20 have as their object the praise of Viṣṇu's supreme lordship over all of creation. "Lord" (Isa) is popularly regarded as an epithet of Śiva. According to Kūresa's verse, people who accept this under- standing then go to the Vedas, and finding the name Isa there, claim that the Vedas conclude that Śiva is the Sup- reme Lord. The Vedas are thereby used to legitimize what is mere popular opinion. But in the case of Vişņu, the Triad is direct (sammukīnā, lit. "face-to-face").

"Smaller than an atom" (anoraṇu-tarah) and "greater than the great" (mahataḥ mahiyan) is taken from KUp 1.2.20: "this person, kept in the cave [of the heart], is even smaller than an atom (aṇoraṇīyān), and the great among the great" (mahatomahiyān). 
24 
This same Upanisadic passage was adapted by Tirumali- cai Alvar in Tiruccantaviruttam, v. 109: "There is none to make You small, but You became smaller, none to make You big, but You become bigger...O God of gods! The sages praise You thus, and I praise you also" (translation by K.K.A. Venkatachari). 
"Expressable by the syllable 'A' which is the root of the sacred syllable AUM". Kūresa's interpretation is based on Rāmānuja, who “argues the supremacy of Nārāyaṇa on the basis of His being denoted by the letter 'A', which is the root of the sacred syllable Aum" (Carman 1981:165). The issue in vs. 20-24 is Visņu's supreme lordship over all other gods. 
"Thousand-headed man" (puruṣaḥ...sahasra-mūrdhā) is based on PuSu (sahasra-sirṣa). See Bhattar, BhGD, No. 226. 
"Lord of past, present and future" (bhūta-bhavya-bhavad- išam) is based on KUp II.1.5: "Lord of past and future" (iśānam bhūta-bhavyasya). See also Bhattar, BhGD, No. 291. 
"Queen" (mahişi) is a term used for the Chief Queen, that is, the first or consecrated wife of a king. 
Kūresa follows Ramanuja's interpretation in this stanza. "Bliss (ananda) multiplied beyond [the range of] speech and mind" is based on TaittUp 1.9.1. Ramanuja argues that this 
http://acharya.org 
Poem in Praise of Śrīvaikuṇṭha 
25 
26 
27 
53 
Upanisadic passage "proceeds to give a definite measure- ment of the excellence of the Bliss of the Brahman in that order in which each succeeding bliss is a hundred fold of the bliss (immediately preceding it); and then speech and mind return from Him (without attaining Him) on account of that (Bliss) being incapable of (such) definite measurement”. According to Rāmānuja, “ānandamaya (or That which con- sists of Bliss) is different from the individual self, who is capable of existing in both the states of bondage and final release" (ŚriBh I.1.7.17). 
"Inner Soul" (antarātma) is a reference to God as antar- yāmin, "Indweller" or the "Soul of the soul"; "Person in the Sun" (puruṣaḥ pauṣṇaḥ, lit. solar person). Both refer- ences are from TaittUp 1.8.5: "He Who is in [the heart of] a human being (puruşe) and He Who is in the Sun (āditye) are one and the same". 
The pattern for the use of proof texts in this verse is based on Rāmānuja, who quotes a number of Upanisadic passages referring to Brahman, and then states: "By means of these and other similar passages, it is made out that Nārāyaṇa Himself, the Lord of all the lords, is the supreme cause. The words 'Sat' (existence), 'Brahman', 'Atman', which are all found mentioned in similar contexts, are particularized by the word 'Nārāyaṇa' occurring in a context similar (to the other above-stated contexts), and they reveal Him alone" (ŚrīBh II.1.6.15). 
SuUp is an important proof text for Rāmānuja. The pas- sages which he quotes from the text often are those which name Nārāyaṇa. (See, for example, ŚriBh I.1.1.1 and II.1.3.9, and BhGBh XII.2). 
"The Supreme Light" (jyotiḥ param), "the Highest Truth" (parama-tattvam), "the Supreme Soul" (parātmā) and "Brah- man" are all called "Nārāyaṇa" in MaNārUp. 
Vişnoḥ padam paramam may denote either the Supreme Brahman Himself or His Supreme Abode of Vaikuntha ac- cording to Rāmānuja. 
In this verse, Kūresa states that the supreme lordship of Viṣṇu, proclaimed in the Upanisads, is evident in His incar- nations as well.

Śrīvaikuntha Stava 
The words "traversing the worlds" refer to the three steps taken by Vişnu's incarnation as Vamana the dwarf. 
The act of Visnu's swallowing the worlds and spitting them out again is referred to by the Alvārs a total of 135 times. It occurs in the poems of all the Alvārs except Tonṭaratipoti's, and is one of the most frequently referred to episodes in DP (Ate 1978:380-81). 
PSV glosses "other undisputed marks" of Viṣṇu with such phrases as: the quality of being the husband of Lakṣmi (lakṣmi-patitva), the quality of reclining on [Ādi]śeṣa (seṣa- sayitva), and the quality of having Garuda as vehicle (vainateya-vāhanatva). 
This verse is connected with the immediately preceding ones in that śrī-patitva, or the quality of being the husband of Śri, is important for establishing the supremacy of the Lord. While Śrī obtains her high status as a result of her having taken refuge with Visņu, the position of this stanza in the group declaring the Lord's supremacy (vs. 17-29) implies the reverse as well. According to Śrīvaisnava theology, Śrī is one of the marks of the Lord's supremacy. For a history of the concept of śri-patitva, see Nayar 1992:229-32. 
Kūresa says that the Goddess is named Śri "because she has taken refuge with [Vişnu]". According to this interpre- tation, the name Śri is derived from the Atmanepada or passive form of the verbal root śri meaning "to lean on, rest on...cling to, be supported or fixed or depend on...to go to, approach, resort or have recourse to (for help or refuge).... (M-W, 1098). The name Śrī may also be derived from the verbal root śrī meaning "to diffuse light, beauty, grace, loveliness, welfare, good fortune...auspiciousness...wealth, treasure, etc." (M-W, 1098). 
"People of eloquent speech" are Valmiki, Tirumarkai Alvar, and Yamuna. See "śrī of Śri" in the Glossary. 
For other examples of word-play on the name Śri, see SS, v. 7, SBS, v. 9 and 69, SRRS I, v. 66, and SGRK, vs. 12 and 29. 
For a complete discussion of the five etymological deriva- tions of the epithet Śrī as found in Pañcaratra, see Vedanta Desika, ŚrīRTS, pp.427-36.

"skeptics" (kautskutāḥ), lit. "those who ask why? how?". PSV glosses the word with kutaḥ kutaḥ iti vadantāḥ. This verse and the following one (v. 32) are concerned with the philosophical statement implying the identity of the world and Brahman. V. 31 sets out the understanding of several philosophical schools, and v. 32 refutes that interpretation by stating why certain of the Upanisads appear to speak of Brahman as jagat or "world". Rāmānuja states that "It is the Brahman Himself, having all the intelligent and non-intelligent things for His body, Who is denoted by the word jagat" in ŚrīBh II.1.6.25. 
The imagery found throughout these praise-poems which describes the world as being manifested on account of the glance of the Lord appears to be a poetic rendering of Rām- anuja's understanding of the complete dependency of the world on God. 
Name and form in Advaita Vedanta are restricted to the ul- timately unreal realm of empirical existence, and are caused by (that is, are dependent on) māyā. According to Ram- ānuja, however, name and form are dependent on the Lord and, in fact, "are not limited to objects in the phenomenal world but are part of the distinctive nature of all entities, in- cluding the Supreme Entity, God Himself" (Carman 1981: 158). 
Note Kūresa's sarcastic humor: the Advaitic belief that nāma-rūpa is dependent on māyā alone is ITSELF a delu- sion. Kūresa says that the Advaitins themselves are deluded concerning the truth that nama-rupa is dependent on the Lord! 
Kūresa explains the secondary meaning (aupacārika) of the words "lordliness" (aiśvaryam) and "supreme lordship" (parama-iśitṛtvam) in this verse. Those who are in some way associated with the Lord share in His quality of lordli- 
ness. 
According to Kūresa and Ramanuja, souls are eternal entities and are dependent on the Lord, whereas the Nyāyikas say that only the five elements (pañca-mahā- bhūta) are eternal, and God creates all else.

Śrīvaikuntha Stava 
According to Rāmānuja's philosophy, an entity can be both eternal AND dependent on the Lord. Kūresa attempts to reconcile this apparent contradiction by an analogy: the Lord's auspicious qualities are both eternal and dependent. "The [three-fold] Cause of the universe" is a reference to the Lord as the material, instrumental, and co-operant cause of the universe, according to the philosophy of Rāmānuja. This verse introduces the topic of Vaikuntha. Verses 41-45, meant to be read together, describe the Supreme Heaven. "the resplendent [state of] union with the Lord" (sayujyam ujjvalam). 
Śrīvaiṣṇavas recognize several degrees of liberation. Only sayujya is the fullest possible union with the Lord. Kūresa has attempted to describe Vaikuntha in several of the previous verses, but here he retreats from being able to ade- quately describe it. 
The ritual actions referred to in this verse are those per- formed for desired fruits such as wealth or heaven. Śrī- vaiṣṇavas regard these kamya rituals as inferior because of the temporary nature of their fruits. 
Five categories of souls are mentioned here: (1) "the pure", or the eternally-free souls (nityas); (2) "those who have transcended changes like birth and old age", or the liberated souls (muktas); (3) "those who possess the wealth of great devotion", or the Lord's devotees on earth (bhaktas); (4) "those who are not attached to worldly existence", or those desirous of liberation (mumukṣus); and (5) "other less fortunate persons", which refers to all others. 
"Those which are one hundred (times bliss]..." (te ye satam) is a quotation from TaittUp 2.8: te ye satam...te ye satam. See also SBS, v. 32. 
"law of karma" (svabhāva-niyamam, lit. "the law of na- ture"). 
"[Means for the] expiation of that sin" (duşkṛtasya nişkṛt- im) refers to the ritual of repentance and confession (prayaścitta) prescribed by the Sastras and the Pañcarātra Agamas. 
This verse is less a statement on the qualities of the Lord ac- cording to the understanding of the philosophers than an

expression of intimacy which, in the compositions of Kür- eśa, often takes the form of teasing and bantering. The topic of this verse is God's incarnations. Compare with Rāmānuja, BhGBh 4:11, and see especially the explication of this passage in Young 1989. 
"For a hundred autumns", a Vedic phrase indicating a very long time, is frequently found in these praise-poems. The Indian autumn, the pleasantest of seasons, noted for its clean, clear air, is identified with clear-sightedness. 
The description of the Lord in this verse contains several "signs of a great person" (maha-puruṣa-lakṣaṇa). "with unblinking eyes" (animeşam, lit. "unblinkingly/un- winkingly"). The idea expressed by this word is that the loveliness of the Lord is so attractive that not a moment should be lost in the visual enjoyment of His beauty. 
Similar listings of the Lord's ornaments are found in the writings of both Yamuna and Rāmānuja. Compare with SR, v. 36, BhGBh 4.34, and VaiGad, para. 5. 
Verses 78-80 are to be read together. For word-play on the name "Śri", see n. 29. 
The ordering of the three consorts Śrī, Bhūmi (Kṣamā), and Nilā -- as it appears in vs. 80-82 -- shows that at least by the time of Kūresa, Kṛṣṇa's cowherdess wife Nappinnai had been integrated into Sanskrit literature as Nīlā. See, for example, Poykai Ālvar, MTA, v. 42 in which the same ordering occurs "Śri and Bhū and the cowherdess girl" (tirumakalum maṇmakaļum āymakaļum). "The abode (or seat) of auspicious qualities untouched by all defects" (mangala-guṇa-aspadam asta-heyam) is clearly Kūresa's adaptation of one of Rāmānuja's famous and frequently used phrases. Compare with BhGBh 4.34: "O sole seat of auspicious qualities untouched by all defects" (nikhila-heya-pratyanika-kalyāṇa-ekātane). Similar phrases occur throughout Kūresa's stotras. 
It is a commonly held Hindu belief that if at the time of birth the Lord's glance falls on a person, (s)he will have the desire for liberation. 
It is not clear in the Sanskrit text whether the last line of this stanza is an exclamation or a question.

Śrīvaikuntha Stava 
Vs. 91-95 describe the unbearableness of worldly miseries. Kūresa's description of life in the womb is based on the Purāņas. Contrary to Freudian thought, which views the womb as a place of contentment to which one might wish to return, the Purāņas describe it as a place of great suffering. See, for example, VP VI.5.11-16: "The tender embryo, surrounded by great filth, floating in water, distorted in its back, neck, and limbs, endures severe pain in the course of its development....unable to extend or contract its limbs...." "By/with horses in the form of sense organs" (indriya- hayaiḥ) is imagery based on KUp 3.3-6, esp. 4: "the senses, they say, are horses" (indriyāni hayānāhuḥ).

You are placed in between Brahmā and Śiva and have a similar position

When You first began to behave like a human You then undertook an exploit

Even though I do not have great confidence in You nor even faith in the meaning of [my own] words 
spoken [in the previous verse], 
and even though I have uttered these words 
once only, 
because of Your compassion alone 
O Sole Ocean of Mercy 
please accept them as truthful 
and as if spoken [by me] repeatedly. 
61 
Even though I am very sinful, 
I have taken the name 
"a seeker of refuge” (śaraṇāgata). 
Therefore, it is not proper for You 
O Lord 
to ignore me. 
When Your knowledge, creative power, 
and compassion 
exist [in boundless measure] 
my sin does not deserve to prevail here [in this world]!

NOTES 
"Occasional incarnation" (vibhavāvatāra) is the Śrīvaiṣṇava technical term for Vişņu's incarnations restricted to particu- lar times and places, such as Rāma and Kṛṣṇa. 
"gods" (amara), lit., "immortals". 
The phrase "fountain of honey" (madhunaḥ utsaḥ) is based on VSū: vişnoḥ pade parame madhva-uthsaḥ. 
Although the central objects of Kūresa's praise-poem are the occasional incarnations of Visņu, even so he begins the work with four verses (vs. 2-5) extolling the Lord's iconic incarnation in the Srirangam Temple. 
In this stanza Kūresa plays on the word rāga, which means both "redness" and "passionate love" (anurāga). 
The very close relationship between Nammālvār and the Lord depicted in the verse is based on a relationship that is described in Nammāļvār's own poems. See, for example, TVM 7.9.1, 7.9.7-8, and 10.7.1-4. 
Poetic references to the shining rays of the Lord's crown are common in the DP. See, for example, PĀTM 4.1.1. This stanza praises the Lord's four-fold creative cosmic emanation (vyūhāvatāra). 
This verse is a very succinct summary of Rāmānuja, ŚrīBh 
III. 2.5.11-25. 
Compare with Rāmānuja, ŚrīBh I.2.1.33. 
Kūresa makes the point in this stanza that Śruti alone cannot lead one to God; rather, He must reveal Himself in His in- carnations. A similar view is expressed in VRS, vs. 6-10. This verse, and the verses referred to above, imply that God Himself is not only the goal (upeya) but the means or way (upaya) to reach the goal of Himself. 
Vişņu sought the boon of a child from lord Siva. See Hari Vamsa, Vişņu Parva. 
See also SBS, vs. 95-97 and VRS, v. 68. 
Kūresa engages in word-play in this stanza. Sarabha is the name of a particular form of Siva and salabha means "moth". According to the rules of Sanskrit grammar, the sounds "r" and "1" are interchangeable (ralaiyoḥ abhedaḥ).

The concept of māyā found in this verse as the wonderful and baffling creative power of the Lord is similar to Rāmānuja's. See, for example, ŚrīBh I.1.1.1 where Rām- ānuja refutes the idea that māyā is synonymous with the in- describable or the unreal: "and hence the word māyā de- notes the creation of wonderful things.... The Highest Person is called the Mayin, simply because He is the owner of that [māyā], but not because He is characterised by ignorance...." For the Alvar influence on Ramanuja's understanding of māyā, see Poykai Alvar, MTA, v. 7 and Nammālvār, TVM, 1.3.10. 
"Whose identity You assumed" (yasyātmatām..adhāḥ tvam) appears to refer to God as the Inner Controller (antaryamin) or "Soul of the soul" of all beings. 
"Placed in between Brahma and Śiva" refers to the usual or- dering of the three gods when they are presented as creator, preserver, and destroyer: Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva. 
The elaborate geneologies of VP contain numerous refer- ences to Visņu's births in the line of solar deities (I.15.130- 131), in the Ikṣvāku family as Rāma (IV.4.41), and in the Yadu family as Kṛṣṇa (IV.11). 
"To a bird", that is, to Jaṭāyu. 
In this verse, Kūresa employs virodha-alarikāra. This poetic device has as its purpose the pointing out of contradictory acts, followed by a questioning as to how things could have happened thus. Kūresa uses it effectively to express his en- joyment of divine paradox. 
The answer to Kūresa's question as to why Rama killed Vali in the way He did, "not face to face like an enemy...but hiding like a hunter in chase of a wild beast" is given in the Rāmāyaṇa itself: (1) The general rule against killing cannot be applied here because monkeys are mere animals, and Rāma was a king, for whom hunting is an appropriate activ- ity; (2) Rama killed the enemy of a good friend; and (3) Rāma had given his word to Sugrīva that he would kill his enemy and thus allow him to gain complete control of the kingdom. If if he had gone to the battlefield, Vāli would certainly have surrendered to him, and he therefore would not have been able to kill him. Had he permitted this to

happen, his words would have been rendered untruthful. (From an interview with Prof. K.K.A. Venkatachari, Bombay 1987). The fact that these answers are given in the text itself points to the fact that in this verse Kūresa is merely "teasing" the Lord, and enjoying an intimate rela- tionship with Him, rather than expecting an answer to a se- rious question. 
"Unborn One/Birthless One" (aja). The epithet appears three times in the VSN. For a variety of Śrīvaiṣṇava ety- mologies, see Bhaṭṭar, BhGD Nos. 96, 206 and 524. Note that all three etymologies emphasize the transcendence and supremacy of the Lord, and hence the epithet adds appropri- ate irony to Kūresa's paradoxical verse. 
Kūresa teases the Lord here with the well-known fact that only things which are already contained in a substance can come out from it at its churning; for example, butter comes from milk. It is not the nature of the ocean to produce a horse, celestial nymphs, poison, etc. 
There is a dispute over the position of this verse in the stotra. In some editions, this verse appears as v. 17, and some editors believe that it is more appropriate to that con- 
text. 
Two basic groups of the Lord's qualities are referred to in this stanza: (1) qualities which are necessary for the Lord to be reached by His devotees, and (2) qualities necessary for 
the Lord to fulfill the desires of the devotees. 
The idea expressed by Kūresa in this stanza is that both Lakṣmaṇa's fainting in battle and Rama's being tied down were permitted in order that their humanity might be re- vealed. 
According to the Rāmāyaṇa story, even the grass and trees existing at the time and place of the Lord's incarnations are said to attain enlightenment through their association with Him. When Rāma left Ayodhya, the entire place was liber- ated. The same idea is expressed in Kulacekara Āļvār, Pmā!TM 10.10, in which it is mentioned that "on that day" (anru), that is, when Rāma left for Vaikuntha, both moving and non-moving things (caracarankalar) went to Vaikuntha along with Him.

Hanuman is regarded as a ciranjivi or one of seven persons blessed with immortality. The others are: Asuddhāma, Bali, Vyāsa, Vibhīṣaṇa, Kṛpācārya, and Parasurāma (MTL, III, 1426). 
Even today this verse is recited at the beginning of every Śrīvaiṣṇava reading of the Rāmāyaṇa. The members of the community believe that Hanuman attends every recitation of the Epic, where he listens devoutly, keeping his hand over his head and with tears in his eyes. For this reason, a front- row seat is always reserved for him. 
Kūresa follows PATM 1.8.7 here by mentioning in a single verse three unconnected VP episodes -- Kṛṣṇa's drinking poison milk from the breast of Pūtanā, His killing of the demon in the form of a wagon (śakaṭāsura), and His uprooting of the arjuna tree when tied to a mortar by his mother Yasoda. See also v. 37. 
"While the immortals forever look upon Paramapada" (pasyatsu sūrīşu sadā...paramapadam). Note how in this verse Kūresa combines Ālvār themes with phraseology of Upanisadic and Puranic verses important to Rāmānuja. Rāmānuja quotes SuUp 6 in VS, para. 122: "The immortals forever look upon that Supreme Abode of Viṣṇu" (tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā paṣyanti sūrayāḥ). And he cites VP in para. 133: "The Yogis, who in perfect concentra- tion constantly meditate upon Brahman, possess that Supreme Place which the immortals regard". Kṛṣṇa's being bound with a rope is one of Kūresa's (and Nammālvār's and Maturakavi's) favorite stories. (See, for example, KNCT). The significance of the Damodara episode for Śrivaiṣṇavas is the accessibility and vulnerabil- ity of God that it reveals. The marks left by the rope tied by Yasoda indicate that God becomes the slave of His devo- 
tees. 
Note how Kūresa combines this Puranic story with epi- thets from the Upanisads. 
The idea of Kṛṣṇa becoming a "laughingstock" is found also in PĀTM 2.7.1: "You are drinking milk (palai) from the pot and those around you are laughing". See also Tirumankai Alvār, PTM 2.2.1.

The later Śrīvaiṣṇava commentators regard the "noble peo- ple" (arya-janaḥ) referred to in this verse as the Alvārs, es- pecially Nammālvār. PSV reflects this tradition in its gloss of the word arya-janaḥ with "Śuka, Parāśara, and so forth, and Lord of the Bhaṭṭas (Periyālvār), Parānkusa (Namm- āļvār), Parakāla (Tirumankai Alvar), and others". Accord- ing to an ancient tradition, Śrīvaiṣṇavas believe that Namm- ālvār lost consciousness at the thought of the Supreme Lord being tied with a rope, as expressed in TVM 5.10.1. See also 1.3.1: "When he stole the butter that was left on the churning stick, he was tied by a rope. 'How can that be, how can that be?"" Śrīvaiṣṇava legend holds that Namm- āļvār kept repeating the last line, "How can that be?", be- cause he was in a religious ecstacy.

This verse includes several "signs of a great man” (mahā- puruṣa-lakṣaṇa ). 
"Pollution" (malinatva) may also be translated "wickedness, 
blackness, impurity". 
In Sanskrit literature, wild animals becoming calm in the presence of a divine figure is a common motif. Here the transformation takes place not just because of the presence of Kṛṣṇa, but because of the beautiful sound of His flute. A similar imagery is found in PATM 3.6.8-10. 
The Lord's body is ENHANCED by the cowherder's attire, because it accentuates His total accessibility. The longing for the Yamuna River, Mathura, Bṛndāvana and the places associated with Kṛṣṇa is often expressed by Antal. See, for example, NT 12.1-10 and 14.1-10. For the footprints of Kṛṣṇa as a symbol of His absence, see 
52 
VP 5.13.29-40. 
"The god of love" (ananga, lit., "bodiless") is "the name of Kama, the god of love, so-called because he was made bodiless by a flash from the eye of Siva for having at- tempted to disturb his life of austerity by filling him with 
love for Parvati" (M-W, 24). 
"my family deity Bṛndavana" (kula-daivatam me 
bṛndavanam). Ramanuja refers to Lord Narayana as his 
"family deity" (kula-daivatam) in VaiGad, para. 3.

Kṛṣṇa Himself is said to prefer tending cows to the glories of Vaikuntha in Nammālvār, TVM 10.3.10. 
See PATM 4.8.1-3 which contains three consecutive stanzas on these three unrelated incidents. 
"the three-fold fault" (tri-vidhāpacara). The three categories of offences or sins (apacāra) are delineated by Rāmānuja in his ŚGad, para. 16. They are: (1) serious offences or sins committed against Me, that is against the Lord (ananta-mad- apacāra); (2) serious offences or sins committed toward My (i.e., the Lord's) [devotees] (ananta-madiyāpacara ); and (3) serious, unbearable or unforgiveable sins or offences (ananta-sahyapacāra). 
The "words spoken [in the previous verse]" to which Kūresa refers are the famous formula of ritual surrender "I take refuge with/ in /at Your feet" (tvadiya caranau śaraṇaṁ prapadye).

I have obtained wisdom from the chief of ascetics Rāmānuja and have taken refuge with the auspicious feet of Hari. 
With a desire to contemplate those feet, I now fearlessly set out to praise the beautiful broad-armed Lord.

We worship the beautiful long-armed [Lord] 
Who dwells on a mountain 
covered with a thicket of trees 
that celebrated pilgrimage place on the Nupura River 
which [wise ones] know [to be] the bestower of desired boons.

Who has beautiful iron-bar-like arms

the sound of Whose unfettered conch

and dissolution of all the worlds? 
29 
As a result of [a single act of] prostration, Sundara, lover of the slopes of Forest Mountain, 
instantly forgives people 
who are weighted down and covered by such limitless, constantly committed sins accumulated here in this beginningless samsara the fruit of a single one of which 
would not be lessened 
even by an experience [of suffering] lasting tens of thousands of eons!

[desirous of] settling the kind and amount of bliss

"Those which are one hundred fold..." 
[but ultimately] proclaimed: 
"This One is not within 
the range of speech and mind".

the Lord at Vanadri Sundarabhuja's mouth 
shines forth! 
47 
The cheeks of Sundara Hari of Vanagiri 
which has trees abounding 
in big black bumble bees intoxicated from [sipping] 
the mango-blossom nectar spread on all sides were ravished at being smelt by Yasoda 
when she lifted His chin 
with her fingertips! 
[Those cheeks] 
which even today clearly reveal 
His unceasing joy 
arising from that [experience] 
illumine [Vanagiri]! 
48 
With beautiful long ears that seem to be imitating 
two boon-bestowing creepers 
[decorated with] the tall golden flowers 
http://acharya.org 
Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord] 
of His dangling earrings, 
Susundarabhuja, the Ornament of Vanasaila, is a fetter for our minds! 
99 
49 
The beautiful-armed young Susundára 
Whose neck is enriched by earrings 
which reach down to the ends of His curly hair and touch His well-formed shoulders 
so pleasing [to the eye] where they meet His neck blossoms forth [in Vanagiri]! 
50 
On a mountain slope surrounded by groves of trees we worship the beautiful broad-armed Lord 
Bearer of Mount [Govardhana] 
Whose broad collar-bone 
is hidden by His well-developed chest, and Whose neck resembles a glistening conch. 
Sundara's arms 
51 
energized with rapture 
during the churning [of the ocean] 
with [Mount] Mandara 
gladdened [in giving delight] 
to Indira 
and adorned by an anointing 
with sandal and aloes 
shine forth [here in Vanagiri]! 
http://acharya.org100 
Sundarabahu Stava 
52 
Distinguished by a decoration that is 
a scar [made] by His bow-string 
and ever ready to bestow [upon His devotees] 
ardently desired boons, 
Susundarabhuja's arms 
imitate with their bounty 
the branches of the boon-bestowing tree. 
53 
The Ruler [of the Universe] at Vanagiri's arms 
which have all the dark-hued richness 
of an ocean, the sky, and a grove of tamāla trees are partakers of the enjoyment 
of [the serpent] Sesa's coils 
and like them are generous, strong, and round. 
54 
The arms of Sundarabahu Hari 
the Lord at Vanagiri 
which vied with one another in the sport 
of uplifting Govardhana [Mountain], 
worked together in the churning of the ocean, 
and desired multiplicity 
in the exhilaration [experienced 
during] the embrace of His consorts, 
[now] decorate [Vanagiri]! 
Of the two- 
55 
the untainted conch and the discus 
that have climbed onto 
the auspicious Lord at Vanadri's lotus palms - the first rests on His lotus-[palm] 
like an excellent royal swan, 
[while] the second has approached 
http://acharya.org 
Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord] 
[the Lord's other lotus-palm] 
like the sun that loves lotuses. 
101 
56 
Enriched by a garland of forest flowers, the Lord at Vanādri Susundara's 
broad, flawless chest -- 
the abode of Laksmi 
adorned by the kaustubha gem 
which is [itself] the abode of the śrivatsa mark -- shines forth! 
The navel of Hari, 
57 
upon Whom Lakṣmi has climbed Who dwells on the mountain [covered] with a thicket of trees 
delighted in by divine damsels with resplendent breasts resembling elephant heads decorates [Vanagiri]! 
Moreover, [that navel] -- 
the birthplace of the lotus from which Brahma is born resembles a deep pit 
[created by} a whirlpool stream overflowing with the essence of the ambrosia of loveliness.

[All] the worlds reside within the stomach 
of the beautiful Sundarabahu 
the Lord of the forested mountain 
which has trees abounding in auspiciousness! 
http://acharya.org 
102 
[But] come see! Ah! 
[His waist] has remained thin! 
Sundarabahu Stava 
59 
The Lord of Forest Mountain 
Sundara's good thighs 
which pulverized the worms 
in the form of wicked Madhu and Kaiṭabha, and are beautifully-rounded 
like a pair of tapering elephant trunks illumine [Vanagiri]! 
60 
With an auspicious form resembling 
the raised humps of two young bulls the knees of the All-pervasive One 
named Sundarabhuja 
Who churned the ocean with Mount Mandara and is Lord [of the Universe] at Vanagiri 
with its valleys glittering 
.with groves of sandal trees 
shine brightly! 
61 
Where are my two eyes wandering, 
having ignored the two legs 
of Susundara the Lord on Forest Mountain similar to the well-rounded, lovely, good stems 
of two lotuses placed face downwards 
in the form of His feet? 
62 
Sundara's lotus-feet surpass the lotus-footrest 
in tenderness. 
http://acharya.org 
Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord] 
Otherwise, how indeed, could [that footrest] called "the thousand petaled [lotus]" bear them? 
103 
63 
Sundarabhuja's lotus-feet 
with their continuous flow of the essence 
of beauty, tenderness, and sweet perfume defeated the lotus-[seat's] desire to emulate [them]. 
Indeed the vanquished [lotus-seat] 
carries them on its head! 
64 
These are indeed the auspicious lotus-like feet of the One Who bears the name Sundara from the washing of which arises a tiny portion 
of the streams of the Ganga. 
Dhruva carries one stream on his head and Śiva bears another 
appropriately named "Alakanandika" 
about which [the Puranic composers] have sung. 
65 
May I salute Sundarabhuja's lotus-foot 
a fragrant flower blossomed from 
the boon-bestowing creeper that is the Veda 
a royal swan [residing] 
in the lotus-hearts of the yogi-kings 
and the best of fruits, 
the ripe mango that is the dharma.

When the mind of Susundara 
Who had taken the form of a dwarf [Vāmana] 
wanted [to take] three strides, 
His two [feet] were so impatient 
that they crossed the three worlds 
in two steps [only]! 
67 
Having surpassed in loveliness the splendour of the moon, 
the line of Sundara's nails 
a row of ripples from the nectar-ocean of beauty's essence called His toes now adorns [Vanagiri]. 
68 
The moon that had become thin, 
insignificant and soiled 
at being "honoured" by [its place on] Śiva's head, 
attained fullness, untaintedness, 
brilliance and multiciplicity 
[by] taking shelter at [Sundara's] feet 
under the pretext of [assuming 
the form of His] nails. 
We honour that Sundara Whose resting-place is on the mountain [covered] with a thicket of trees. 
69 
It is accepted by all people that [the Lord's consort] 
whose act of glancing 
is the moment-by-moment cause 
of the dominion of lords [such as Brahmā] 
is [named] Śri because 
she has resorted to Sundara. 
http://acharya.org 
Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord] 
So people of noble speech declare You [to be] 
the śri of Śri. 
70 
With divine, inscrutable, abundantly marvellous 
excellent auspicious qualities 
beginning with youthfulness and beauty and with amorous gestures that are dear 
pregnant with wonderful emotion, graceful and ever incomparable, Vanadri's Lord delights Śrī 
eternally inseparable [from Him] and suitable [for Him] 
by virtue of her nature, form, and riches, 
and [His other consorts] such as Nīlā and Bhūmi. 
71 
With sweet guidance in 
the looks and expressions of love 
and with heartfelt affection for 
the intense observation of each other's gestures, 
the Lord at Vanaśaila 
Who experiences incessant and ever-fresh 
divine sentiments 
will delight His own beloved. 
72 
Respecting his own coil (bhogam) 
[as meant] for the enjoyment (bhogam) of Sundara 
the Resident of Vanagiri, 
the lord of serpents 
delights in his own names [Bhoga and] Śeşa 
because his form is that of 
subservience (seṣata) [to the Lord].

The lord of the birds 
who is composed of the Three Vedas [assumes] forms such as 
vehicle, seat, canopy, and chowrie 
[in order to serve Viṣṇu]. 
This same Sundarabhuja 
Who delights in [Garuda's] eternal servitude has become the One Who goes to Vanadri! 
74 
The good commander of [Viṣṇu's] armies [becomes so] by eating the left-overs of Susundara 
the Lord at Vanādri, 
and as sole controller of all the worlds waits for [Visnu's] glance [of approval] before performing all his tasks. 
75 
Paraphernalia such as parasol and chowrie, the [eternal] sages and attendants, 
and true and eternal qualities 
beginning with knowledge and power 
[have approached] the beautiful broad-armed [Lord] and blaze perpetually [in Vanādri]. 
76 
Those who share the position of courtier, and also the best of door-keepers, 
the leaders of the [Lord's] attendants, 
and my earlier preceptors 
have [all] resorted to Sundara 
Who has gone to the mountain forest.

Sundara Who abides eternally 
in His own ever perfect region of enjoyment 
[served by His] attendants and paraphernalia rejoices on the slopes of Vanagiri visible to the eyes of all. 
107 
78 
The Bearer of Laksmi is just as devoted 
to the slopes of Lion Mountain 
as to the pleasure gardens of Vaikuntha 
abounding in lush and fragrant flower-filled pools and bowers of beautiful vines! 
79 
Remaining eternally [in Vaikuntha] along with Lakṣmi, Bhū, and Nīlā 
inside the great jewelled mandapa in the palace of bliss 
[reclining] on the lord of serpents and fit to be served solely by 
His own countless, eternal, and divine attendants, Sundarabahu 
is devoted to Vanādri! 
80 
Remaining perpetually 
in the eternal, limitless abode of Vaikuntha 
which is called the Highest Sky, 
is composed of the purest sattva, 
and is the opposite of matter 
made up of the three gunas, 
that very Hari 
Who transcends the best yogis' speech and mind is [simultaneously here] in Vanādri!

This Primordial Egg 
containing within itself the fourteen worlds 
with their seven coverings multiplied by ten as well as hundreds of other such [eggs] have become [mere] playthings for Sundara in his action of sport here [in Vanagiri]! 
82 
This world differentiated variously 
beginning with divine beings, humans, and animals 
the Cosmic Egg with its seven coverings, 
Prakṛti and Puruşa, and liberated souls 
becomes a plaything for the action of the All-pervading Lord at Vanadri's sport! 
83 
Continually engaged in yoga 
and blessed with the highest devotion 
to Sundara's feet, 
the possessors of knowledge 
obtain Final Liberation in the Supreme Abode 
and enjoy [there] the position of 
eternal servitude [to the Lord]. 
84 
So wonderful indeed is 
God Sundarabhuja's character or motherly affection toward those who seek shelter [with Him], 
that He, the Lord at Vanadri, 
Who practices impartiality 
toward those who take refuge with Him has adorned the world with His incarnations without giving up His inherent divine nature!

O Lord on Lion Mountain! The subtle [Upanisadic] statements described Your supra-sensual form as transcending speech and mind. 
This being so, 
had You not descended here 
[making Yourself visible to all], 
109 
the injunctions regarding knowledge and devotion would have become meaningless by now! 
86 
You incarnated in the middle of the [Cosmic Egg] 
assuming the divine forms of 
gods, humans, and others 
in order to embrace those devotees 
whose minds have You as their sole enjoyment and for whom [You] are the only salvation, and in order to destroy their enemies. 
O Lord at Vanagiri! 
Because of this, 
petitionary prayer for whatever one wants has become easy for gods and humans! 
87 
O Lord on the great, resplendent Forest Mountain! If people have been blinded to Your glory by Your primary appearance 
as Vişņu in between Brahma and Śiva, then how [much more so] would they be after learning of Your becoming a fish! 
http://acharya.org110 
Sundarabahu Stava 
Hey God! 
O Sundarabhuja! 
88 
Acting contrary to Your [true] greatness, if You so easily accept 
[equality to Brahma and Śiva] 
in the middle of the [Cosmic] Egg, then fostering inferiority to these gods would be even better than 
[encouraging mere] equality to them! 
89 
O Lord at Vanādri! 
After having descended here 
concealing Your lordly glory, which pleased You more 
Śiva's victory [over You]? 
or being tied down by the weapon of Indrajit? 
90 
O Lord on Lion Mountain! 
O Bearer of Lakṣmi! 
O Ever Undiminished One! 
Even though You want to conceal it, 
the magnificence of the lotus-eyed One is easily perceived! 
How can Your might not [be seen], 
when You assumed the divine form of a fish flopping about in the flood of ocean water [at the time] of the deluge 
in which a whirlpool was made to revolve shaken by the flipping of Your tail raised on high? 
http://acharya.org 
Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord] 
91 
Long ago at the time of the deluge, 
You took the wonderful form of a fish 
and grew up in the water 
of a pit in the ground 
a pond 
and the River Gangā 
with Manu's boat tied to your crest, 
O Sundara! 
92 
Becoming a shelter for the gods who were wandering about with despondent faces, 
seeking asylum because their own abodes were filled with flood water 
during the dissolution of the worlds, out of His own compassion this fish-bodied Sundarabhuja 
Who dwells in Vanagiri 
with a majestic gait 
supported the mountain range on His own back 
in His action of making turbid 
the water impelled by the surging sea! 
93 
Long ago You, the Unborn One, 
Who assumed the wonderful form of a tortoise 
bothered neither by the rotation 
of the best of mountains 
[placed on] Your own back 
nor by the movements of the Milk Ocean 
severely shaken at being churned by the Serpent, 
rejoiced [and hence] Your eyes [retained] 
the lustre of a fully-bloomed lotus! 
O Hari! O Beloved of Lion Mountain!

Sundarabāhu Stava 
O Sundara! 
O Resident of Lion Mountain! 
Because of the desire of You Who are Varaha for the uplifting of the world 
sunk [in the deluge of the cosmic dissolution], this earth long ago became visible 
as a spot on the moon called "tusk". 
O Sundarabhuja! 
95 
When the Man-Lion 
with a resplendent wonderful form 
was in the pillar, 
the air throbbed not 
the moon and the sun set not 
the quarters became obscured 
the entire earth with its mountain ranges shook 
the sky melted 
and the water of the ocean boiled! 
96 
When the Man-Lion tore open 
the chest of the enemy of the gods 
the nether world was scattered 
and the abode of the gods was dissolved 
the earth was thoroughly shaken 
the quarters were obscured 
and the ocean surged 
swaying to and fro with a [swishing] sound, O Sundarabhuja! 
97 
That [very same] Man-Lion 
Who saw His own form 
reflected in the mass of blood 
http://acharya.org 
Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord] 
113 
flowing from a region of the demon's chest tom with the tips of His sword-like claws and became enraged on account of His suspicion 
[that the reflection was that] of a rival lion is visible here [in Vanagiri] as Sundara. 
98 
How can [the earth] 
deserve being begged for by You 
O Lord at Vanagiri, O Varada, O Vāmana when it belongs to You alone 
because You create, sustain, and destroy it, and also because You swallow it, 
eject it [from Your stomach], and raise it up? 
99 
O Lord at Vanagiri lovely with jasmines! Do You remember [how] 
a long time ago, becoming Bhargava, You cut down the forest of arms 
belonging to Arjuna 
who was puffed up with pride at his power? 
100 
O Lord at Vanagiri! 
You descended here 
and became a Raghava, O Sundara, for the purpose of instructing believers in how to practice 
completely and without any omissions 
the dharma enjoined by the revered Three Vedas which are known as Your commandment. 
http://acharya.org 
114 
Sundarabahu Stava 
101 
The Lord at Vanagiri is regarded by the gods 
as the Supreme Ruler 
because He broke the Destroyer of Tripura's 
Tripura-destroying bow 
and because of the sight of Him 
stringing His own bow 
as Paraśurāma. 
102 
Here [in this transitory world] 
people want what they can't have 
and what they can have they don't truly enjoy. 
O Rāma, all things are already Yours, so You look upon the [whole] world as equal to a blade of grass, O Sundara! 
103 
A relisher [of the beauty of nature], 
You experienced living in Dandaka Forest 
on the mountains 
in the wooded thickets 
and near crystalline streams. 
[Desirous] of enjoying [that loveliness] once again 
O Rāma 
You became Sundara 
and now resort to the excellent Forest Mountain! 
O Sundara! 
104 
On a rock at the site of Vanagiri's slopes decorated with groves of trees and gardens 
[inhabited by] celestial musicians 
and pure, semi-divine beings 
http://acharya.org 
Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord] 
clinging to the large rocks 
and singing loudly of Your exploits, You enjoy respite from the fatigue caused by Your pursuit of the fleeing deer! 
105 
What a story we've heard! 
Standing on the shore of the southern ocean 
You tore apart with a single arrow 
the demons who had gone far away 
to the northern part of the ocean 
and then conquered the lord of waters [Varuṇa]. 
Therefore, O Lord at Vanādri 
O Resplendent One, O Sundara 
Your amusements 
beginning with the building of a bridge 
are just a noisy spectacle! 
106 
O Ornament of the Raghu dynasty! 
Long ago You were intent upon 
hunting the deceptive deer, 
namely the demon [Marica]. 
Do You today resort to Vanādri 
full of thickets of trees 
in which bees are buzzing in order to remove the exhaustion brought on by that [event]? 
Hey Sundara! 
107 
In that one birth when You became Kṛṣṇa Rukmuni as well as Nīlā 
suitable [for You] because of her lineage 
http://acharya.org 
115 
116 
Sundarabahu Stava 
were boons for You 
Who graciously favoured in a single instant 
two mothers, two fathers 
and also two families! 
108 
O Sundara, do tell [me]! 
When You were still a nursing infant 
and drank from the breast of Pūtanā, did you digest in Your stomach 
the indigestible poison in the form of milk along with her life itself? 
109 
If You took on the condition of a human 
becoming easily accessible 
to those who seek refuge [with You] -- so be it, O Sundara! 
[But] what made You [allow Youself] to be tied with a rope to a mortar, 
and to what end did You then start crying? 
110 
O beautiful broad-armed [Lord]! 
Becoming Nanda's delight, 
with hair curls having the illusory appearance 
of big black bees, 
You stole [not only] the best fresh butter 
from the houses [in Bṛndāvana] 
[but] the hearts of the cowherdesses too! 
111 
O Sundara Who has resorted to Vanasaila! My head desires the state 
http://acharya.org 
Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord] 
of Kaliya's hood 
or the top of the good kadamba [tree] because Your pair of lotus-feet 
was placed upon them! 
112 
Even though, O Sundara, 
You hid your glory in Vraja, 
why did you overrun Indra? 
Why did you hold aloft [Govardhana] Mountain 
for seven nights? 
And why did You 
get angry 
with inquisitive friends? 
113 
O Son of Nanda! 
O Susundara! 
O One named Sundara! 
On hearing the sound of Your flute 
as You frolicked with the cowherdesses 
in Bṛdāvana, 
the trees and rocks 
melted just like wax! 
O Sundara! 
114 
O Broad-armed One! 
O Lord at Vanagiri! 
When You sported in Bṛndāvana with multitudes of cowherdesses 
singing and singing again 
http://acharya.org 
117 
118 
Sundarabahu Stava 
in the festivity of the rāsa dance, the hearts of those women experienced varied shades of the moods of love. 
What indescribable condition [of joy] did your own heart experience then? 
115 
Your amorous gestures 
and the blinking of Your eyes 
are delightful, wonderful, and agreeable. 
Your chastisement of worms like Kamsa is extolled as [an equally] trifling [act], O Sundara. 
O Sundarabhuja! 
116 
Your amusements such as the burning of Varanasi 
the destruction of Pauṇḍraka and Bhauma 
the snatching away of the parijata tree 
the paralysing of Siva 
and other [feats] 
such as the slaughter of the armies 
in the Bharata [War] 
are nectar to the ears. 
O Sundara! 
117 
O Lord at Vanādri! 
With Your pair of lotus-feet served by the gods, 
You perpetually stand on the peak 
of the excellent Mountain called Venkata 
for the sake of those who seek shelter [with You]!

You compassionately grant [Your devotees] whatever they desire, 
and You take pity on 
the entire universe, 
O Sundara! 
119 
O Sundara! O Lord at Vanādri! 
You eternally recline 
on the Serpent Couch 
in the middle of the Milk Ocean. 
[Yet] out of motherly affection You have made Your glory present to Your devotees on earth, and here on the banks of the [river] 
that arises from the Sahya Mountains, You recline on the Serpent Couch in Your own Abode of Srirangam becoming a feast for the eyes of all! 
120 
Becoming Kalki, O Lord, 
You will kill all the wicked people polluted by Kali [Yuga's] impurity! 
This is Your chance,

the protection of people

Never is it otherwise! 
So, O Sundara, 
I take refuge with 
You! 
122 
Poets celebrate You 
as an ocean of the nectar of compassion, as dependent on those who have resorted to You, and as the [Final] Refuge [of Your devotees]! 
Becoming visible to the eyes of these [devotees), You adorn Vanādri. 
O [Lord] named Sundara! Ah! How wonderful it is! 
123 
Nothing is impossible for You! 
Even though You know all about us You are compassionate and forgiving! 
An insignificant person 
unable to leave my sins 
and without any other recourse, I am, therefore, dependent on You. 
Forgive me, 
for I have so little strength,

All by Yourself You brought back to life the monkeys killed in the battle of Lanka, the Brahmin's son, dead owing to the fault of Śiva, the dead son of Sandipani, 
the Brahmin's young sons who went to Vaikuntha, and the child in the womb belonging to Arjuna. 
Would one such as You 
O Lord at Vanagiri fail to grant the desire 
of my guru and me? 
125 
You caused the creatures belonging to Ayodhya together with the animals, insects and grass to go to Your own eternal worlds 
which have a majesty 
attainable only in the state of Final Liberation! 
Now what [good] deeds [had they performed]? Rich in what kind of knowledge were they, O Lord at Vanagiri? 
126 
As the Boon-Bestower on Elephant Hill You gave sight to the man blind from birth 
named Haritavaraṇabhṛtya 
and, oh Sundara, truly in that same way, 
You have openly [given sight] 
to more than a hundred such [people]!

O Lord at Vanagiri! 
O Ocean of Compassion! 
Please assent to my sincere [request]! 
May I [once again] be in one corner of the Abode of Srirangam 
absolutely subject to 
Ramanuja the Noble just like before! 
130 
O Creator of Brahma! O Lord at Vanādri! 
O Lord! O Sundara! 
Looking to Your position 
as the bestower of boons, 
by all means hear [my request].

O Lord of the dharma!

O One Who has motherly affection 
for good people! 
Drive away all the worthless ones and forgiving in the twinkling of an eye all the offences committed by good people make the glory of the Srirangam Abode ever enjoyable [for Your devotees]! 
132 
[Although] I have committed sins 
have no other recourse, 
am foolish, without a refuge other than You, 
am evil-hearted and evil-minded, 
I shall solicit You openly and repeatedly 
again and again and again 
[until] I become a vessel of 
Your boundless compassion, O Sundarabhuja! O Lord at Vanagiri!

"Rāmānuja" (śrīrāma-avanuja, lit. "the younger brother of Śrirāma", that is, Lakṣmaṇa). Note that this is also the meaning of the name Rāmānuja.

Sundarabahu, Sundarabhuja and their synonyms are renderings into Sanskrit from the Sanskritized Tamil epithet (cuntarat tōluṭaiyan) contained in Aṇṭāļ, NTM 9.1, used in praise of the same icon that is the subject of Küresa's stotra. It is customary in Sanskrit literature for authors to intro- duce their literary compositions by mentioning: (1) visaya, or the subject of the work; (2) prayojana, or its purpose; 
(3) sambandha, or the relationship of author to subject; and (4) adhikari, or the qualification of the author for writing the composition. Kūresa mentions all four in this stanza. The subject of his poem is the greatness of Lord Sundarabahu, and the purpose of the poem is its author's desire to see the Lord's feet. The author is related to his subject by his great desire to see his subject Sundara, and the poet's qualifica- tion to compose the poem is based both on his having taken refuge with the feet of Hari, and on his having obtained wisdom from his Acārya Rāmānuja. 
Vanagiri and its synonyms Vanadri and Varasaila often function as proper names (referring to the holy site in its en- tirety). For that reason, the terms have been translated into English in some stanzas only. 
"the moon's crawling round it like a child” (śaśadhara- rinkhaṇa). Two of the descriptions employed by Kūresa in this verse are based on Nammalvar's verses in praise of the same iconic incarnation: "... the sound of the conch (kural cankattu) shakes (the worlds] in the temple of Alakar (alakar-tam kōyil)." And again: "the moon crawls (mati taval) on the peak of the hill of Tirumaliruñcōlai (kuţumi maliruñcōlai in TVM 2.10.2). 
The presence of divine damsels on this mountain is men- tioned in several Alvar hymns. For example, "divine damsels" (tevya makalirkal) come to the Nupura River (cilamparkka vantu) for bathing" (PĀTM 4.2.1).

In order to prevent confusion, I have generally preferred the more familiar names of the two gods Śiva and Brahma to the variety of names and epithets contained in the poems. 
In this verse and in v. 68, Kūresa links Śiva -- with whom the archaic Tamil god Murukan is associated -- to the notion of "taint" or "pollution". According to Saiva mythology, Śiva has the crescent moon as his crest ornament. In Sanskrit court poetry, metaphors are often employed which play on the relation of the dark spots on the moon to the clean white disk. Kūreśa suggests that the moon's dark spots (that is, its defects) have been caused by its contact with Śiva because the moon is his crest ornament. Kūresa explicitly contrasts this defectiveness or pollutedness of the moon (which is said to come from its association with Śiva since it resides in his matted hair) with the untaintedness that results from the contact with Visņu. For a study of the concept of the "untaintedness" of the Lord in the early Śrīvaiṣṇava tradition, see Nayar 1992:82-86. 
This verse is intelligible only in the context of PĀTM 4.2.5: "Tirumāliruñcōlai (that is, Vanagiri] -- where a black elephant in order to stop his mate, who was leaving him after a quarrel, shouted out in the name of the sea-blue coloured Lord Alakar [Sanskrit, Sundara] and had his mate turn back on hearing the Lord's name -- is the hill where dwells Lord Kṛṣṇa who once accepted the service of an ele- phant [whom he rescued from a crocodile] on the banks of a pond and who killed the elephant sent by Kamsa to destroy him" (translation by Prof. K.K.A. Venkatachari). 
Śrīvaiṣṇava devotees believe that even animals and inani- mate objects may be devoted to God. especially when they live in the environs of the Lord's dwelling places. In fact, they regard it preferable to be born as an animal or inanimate object in a sacred place than as a god in heaven (svarga). Kulacekara Alvar articulates this idea in PmalTM: "I who am enlightened shall not seek the transient human frame again. I shall seek to be a bird (kurukay) in the temple at Tirumalai. I do not pray for Indra's pomp surrounded by the immortal beauty of the nymphs and heaven (svarga) but

shall seek to be a fish in the streams of the Tirumalai Hills...". (Cited in Varadachari 1970:70). "that Indescribable Entity" (kim api vastu, lit. "some thing", "some one thing"). The indefinite is used in this stanza to express the limitless greatness and indescribability of the Lord. 
21 
"Long-stretching ears" (karṇa-pāśa) is one of the signs of a great man (mahā-puruṣa-lakṣaṇa). 
"The One upon Whom Sri has climbed or mounted" (prārūḍha-śriyam). Several synonymous epithets appear in this stotra: ārūḍha-śriḥ and adhyarudha-śriyam in vs. 17 & 24, samucchrita-śriyah in v. 41, and ārūḍha-lakṣmyāḥ in v. 57. All are Sanskrit variants of the Tamil name applied to Lord Sundarabahu contained in Antal, NTM 9.6 "[the Lord] upon whom Tiru (Śri) climbs" (ēru tiruvuṭaiyāṇ). 
"The Immortal One" (amṛtam) may likewise be translated "Nectar." While "Immortal" would seem the more appro- priate within the context of Upanisadic epithets, Nammālvār calls the Lord "nectar" in his eulogy of Sundarabahu: "[He is] honey and milk and sugarcane and nectar" (tenum palum kannalum amutum) in TVM 8.8.4. 
The first line of the stanza is a quotation from MaNārUp 11.3, reworded for purposes of metre. 
Kūresa's interpretation of the "Great One" (bhūman) is founded on Ramanuja's ŚrīBh I.3.2.7. 
In this verse, Kūresa follows Ramanuja's interpretation of daharamākāśam, the "subtle ether within the cavity of the heart", as denoting the Supreme Brahman rather than the individual soul. See ŚriBh I.3.5.13-22. 
The conception of the phenomenal world expressed in this verse is based on Ramanuja's doctrine of seṣa-seṣi-bhāva. For a full discussion of Ramanuja's view, see Carman 1981: 147-57. 
Rāmānuja teaches that all words, even those referring to insentient matter (acit), point to Visnu. ŚriBh I.1.6.13 states that "...those intelligent individual souls, who have particular masses of matter for their bodies, form modes of the Highest Self. Therefore they (that is, those words refer- ring to matter) finally include in their import the Highest

Self Himself. Thus the Highest Self Himself is denoted by all words". 
According to the Pañcarātra Āgamas, the Lord, as Para Vasudeva, is sāntodita, that is, "inert"; the three subsequent creative cosmic emanations (vyūha), corresponding to the creation, maintenance and dissolution of the universe, are characterized by constant activity (nityodita) (LakṣmiTantra 2.49-51). By way of contrast, the Śrīvaiṣṇavas have their own interpretation of these two descriptions of the Lord: in the santodita state (as in this verse), God enjoys His own qualities only, while in the active nityodita state He enjoys His creation as well. 
For "[the Lord] upon Whom Śrī has climbed", see v. 16. In this verse, Kūresa may be thinking of Nammālvär, who could only enjoy one quality of the Lord at a time; lost in this single quality, he would forget all others. 
The idea that God shows the greatness of His mercy by ig- noring the limitless sins of His devotees is further devel- oped by Kūresa's great-grandson Vedācārya Bhaṭṭar in his poem Ksamāṣodasi (Stotramālā 1969:75-76). "shelter" (samśrita); “status of birth” (jāti); “nature" (svabhava). Compare this verse with Rāmānuja, BhGBh 9.29: "...With regard to taking shelter (samśrita) [with Me], no one deserves my hatred because (s)he is inferior in birth (jāti), form (akāra), nature (svabhāva), knowledge (jnāña)”. "those which are a hundred fold..." (ye te satam); "This One is not within the range of speech and mind" (na evaiṣaḥ varmanas-gocarah). The first phrase is a direct quotation from TaittUp 2.8; the second phrase is a restatement of TaittUp 2.9. This Upanisadic passage is often quoted in the Acāryas' praise-poems. 
The image here of the combining of colours is based on the Tamilian practice of mixing three fruits (banana, mango, and jackfruit) on festive occasions. Poets say that the enjoyment that arises from a mixture of these three fruits, with honey added, resembles God's enjoyment of the universe. In the same way, the mixture of molten gold, emeralds, and col- lyrium, increases the enjoyment and beauty of each individ- ual item. Traditionally, the black of the collyrium is said to

represent Kṛṣṇa; emerald is symbolic of the reflection of the iconic Lord's beauty, and gold represents sheen and wealth. Although the beauty of these three can be enjoyed sepa- rately, the overall beauty is believed to be enhanced by their mixture (From an interview with Prof. K.K.A. Venkat- achari, November 1986). 
41 
See PATM 3.2.3. in which the Lord's body is compared to [a mixture of] gold and emeralds. 
"Embellished by groves of growing young trees" (vardhīṣṇu-bāla-drūma-şanda-manditam) is based on Nam- māļvār, TVM 2.10.1 in which the place of Sundarabahu is described as "a dense garden surrounded by tender young trees" (valarilampolicul). 
In the eulogy of important human beings such as kings, po- ets traditionally begin with the head, while for the part-by- part description of God, poets (out of humility) often begin with the feet. Notice that Kūresa, following several of the Āļvārs, reverses the accepted order. 
42 
For examples of this genre from DP, see Nammāļvār, TVM 7.7 and Tiruppāṇ Alvar, Aāp. 
The reference to the Lord's hair thus, "[it] surpasses the de- scription of beautiful fibres fashioned from the essence of pitch-black blinding darkness", is based on Nammāļvār, TVM 7.7.9 in which the author asks if he sees pitch-black darkness (irulai)... made into a mass of black threads (nīla nannül). He then replies that what he sees is really the lovely hair of the Lord. 
For "[the Lord] upon Whom Śri has climbed", see v. 16. 
The Lord's forehead reminds the poet of a half-moon both because of its shape and because of its glow. For identical imagery, see VRS, v. 32. See also Nammālvär, TVM 7.7.7 in which the Lord's forehead is compared to "a waxing moon in mid-fortnight". 
The alankara employed by Kūresa in this verse is that ex- pressive of sandeha, or doubt. It is especially effective in in- voking wonder and confusion when confronted with the beauty of the Lord. 
Similar comparisons of the Lord's eyebrows to bows are contained in Antal, NTM 14.6 and Nammal vär, TVM 7.7.4.

Sundara's cheeks being smelt (aghraṇa) by Yasoda is a ref- erence to the custom of holding the face of a child close to one's nose.

The area of the body from the collar bone to the chest is regarded as being very attractive. Its breadth and strength are features much admired in Indian wrestlers. 
"a scar [made] by His bow-string" (jyakina). The Lord's four arms are described as having the "a scar [made] by His bow-string" (jyakiṇa) in Yamuna, SR, v. 33. 
Kūresa's description of the conch as "resting on His lotus- palm...like an excellent royal swan" is based on Aṇṭāļ, NTM 7.7 which images the conch as "mounted on the palm of Vā- 
sudeva's hand like a swan". 
Fr. "the [Lord] upon Whom Lakṣmi has climbed or 
mounted", see v. 16. 
The similes comparing the navel to a whirlpool and breasts to elephant heads are not original to Kūresa, but are common in both Sanskrit and Tamil poetry. 
The 
paradox of the Lord Who swallowed all the worlds but yet has a thin waist fascinates Kūresa. Compare with VRS, v. 49. 
The comparison of the human thigh to an elephant's trunk is a standard one in Sanskrit poetry. 
The sacred site of Lord Sundarabahu is described as being "in a grove of sandal trees" (cantanappolilin) in Tirumańkai Āļvār, PTM 9.8.9. 
The idea of defeat is conveyed by vs. 62-63. A defeated man is spoken of as being forced to carry the feet of his conqueror on his head. In that same way the lotus footrest, defeated in tenderness by the lotus-feet of the Lord, is forced to carry those feet on its "head". 
While it is popularly believed that Śiva receives the heavenly Ganga on his head, according to Vaiṣṇavas he receives only the stream called Alakananda, which is the Ganga of India, and not the celestial Gangā (Wilson 1980:331). Compare with Yamuna, SR, v. 40, which also contains a play on the name Seṣa.

Kūresa's description of Visvaksena in this stanza is based on Yamuna, SR, v. 41. 
The attendants [of the Lord] in Vaikuntha are said to have taken refuge with Sundarabahu because they are present in His temple. The Pañcarātra Agamic tradition requires that doorkeepers guard every temple entrance in order to prevent the entry of the wrong persons into the temple's Inner Sanc- tum. (Hari Rao 1967:101, 110, and 123). 
Much of the vocabulary of this verse is identical to Rāmānuja, VaiGad, para. 4. 
"salvation" (ātma-sanjīvana, lit. "revivification of the soul”). Kūresa employs here the term found two times in the last three paragraphs of Ramanuja's VaiGad. 
This verse, a rendering of Tirumankai Āļvār, PTM 11.4.1, contains the same number of syllables per line (23) (Aṇṇankarācāriyar 1965). 
Kūresa's phrase "a spot on the moon called tusk" is a reference to one of the marks on the moon which is said to resemble a boar's tusk. 
The cutting of the king's thousand arms by Parasurama (Bhargava) is described in Tirumankai Alvar, PTM 5.6.7. 107 Kūresa's mention of Nila as "suitable [for You] because of 
her family” (nīlā kulena sadṛsi), confirms her identity with Nappinnai/Pinnai of the indigenous Tamil tradition. 
While Rukmiņi is mentioned in Nammālvār, TVM only once, and twice only in PATM, Nappinnai is mentioned by these authors more than 150 times (Annankarācāriyar 1965). 
Kṛṣṇa's being born to one woman, and raised by another is referred to by Antal in TP, v. 25. 
112 Here Kūresa refers to an episode in which Krsna became angry because he wanted to hide His supremacy, but His friends still questioned Him about it. Anṇankarācāriyar notes that there are parallel ideas in the BhP, although seemingly not elsewhere (1965). 
120 Śrīvaiṣṇavas interpret the intensity and poignancy of 
Küresa's request for God to descend on earth as Kalki "right here before our eyes" in the context of the trouble in Srirangam implied in vs. 129-31. 
http://acharya.org 
Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord] 
122 "You adorn" (paricaskarişe, past perfect, 2nd singular), 
translated according to the gloss in PSV, alankaroși (present, 2nd singular). 
131 
126 The traditional interpretation of vs. 126-27 is that Kūresa is 
praying for the restoration of his own sight. According to Srivaiṣṇava hagiographical literature, Kūresa was blinded by an evil Saiva king (known only as Krmikantha or "the worm-necked one"), who persecuted the Vaiṣṇava commu- nity during the era of Rāmānuja. 
128 "made Your devotee" (carana-satkṛtavan, lit. "one who was 
reduced to Your feet"). 
129 This verse and the two which follow it substantiate the tra- 
ditional Śrīvaisnava view that this stotra was composed 
when Kūresa was in exile in Vanagiri during a time of trouble in Śrirangam. 
130 Kūresa's words "enhancing day-after-day the glory of Śrī- rangam" (śriranga-sriyam anvaham praguṇayan) are recited at the conclusion of all Śrīvaiṣṇava public recitations of the hymns of the Āļvārs. 
132 "Offences committed by good people" may refer to the be- 
trayal of Kūresa by his own disciple Nālūrān, who is said to have pointed out Kūresa and his teacher Ramanuja to some Śaivas who came searching for them on behalf of the king (see n.126). This story is contained in several late hagio- graphies, and was related to me by K.K.A. Venkatachari.

Whom the creeper

manifold shoots sprouted forth. 
5 
I resort to that Hill of the Elephant which makes visible [to us] 
He of whom the Triad speaks 
by way of its instruction 
as imperceptible 
by refuting other descriptions [of Him] with the words "not this, not this" (neti neti).

While to unfortunate ones 
the Three Vedas may not [appear to] demonstrate that [Viṣṇu] is Lord, 
who would not conclude 
in the Abode of the Elephant 
that Devaraja is Lord indeed? 
How wonderful!

or without.

By means of maxims, syllogisms 
and the refined sayings of eminent sages, the Three Vedas might with difficulty enable sinless people

[enables] everyone [to enjoy Him].

That which is forcefully proclaimed by the words: 
"There is an Entity extremely wonderful, 
great, of boundless nature and incomparable..." is [itself] truly seen 
right in front [of us] 
in the Abode of the Elephant.

Even in the opinion of those who regarded the Triad

[such as perception and inference], the Three Vedas have now become a means to valid knowledge with regard to the Highest Reality [solely] because of Hasti Hill.

Here in this world 
an entity endowed with good qualities is considered auspicious because of those qualities. 
In You, O Lord of Hasti Hill, [it is precisely] the opposite!

long eyes 
teeth showing through Your smile 
a lustrous lower lip 
arched brows 
and ears reaching down 
to Your shining shoulders 
remain in me forever, 
O Lord of the Elephant! 
143 
41 
When the Lotus-Lady linked her arm with Yours 
inspired by the sentiment of love 
what indescribable state did Your neck 
as beautiful as a conch

and highly esteemed [by her] experience then, 
O Lord at Karigiri?

Varadaraja Stava 
O Varada! 
Your four boon-bestowing arms 
[strong] like iron bars 
gleam like the dark [branches of] a tamāla tree. 
Or are they [broad] like expansive oceans 
stretched out wide 
or do they openly shine like the four directions? 
43 
Ah Varada, 
[Tell me!] 
Did Your arms meet with their greatest joy 
in the embrace of Indira? 
in clasping the cowherdesses 
during the ardently desired rasa dance? 
or in being tied down by Yasoda for the offence of stealing fresh butter? 
O Varada! 
44 
Your arms shine with reddish finger-tips 
like the branches of a sala tree 
which has finger-tips in 
the form of tender sprouts 
http://acharya.org 
Praise-Poem to the Boon-Bestower King 
like the billows of an ocean topped with [pink] corals 
and like superior serpents 
their faces aglow with their hood-gems. 
45 
You churned the ocean 
with Your own [hands]. 
Moreover, 
You held aloft for seven nights the mountain [Govardhana] 
and twisted the necks 
of the seven bulls. 
Even then, O Varada, 
Your hands did not grow tired. 
O Varada! 
46 
Was the red tint of Your hands 
caused by Your crawling 
in the courtyards and houses of Vraja? 
from gripping the stick 
for controlling the cows 
in the cowherders' cowpens? 
or from holding onto the goad and reins while driving the [chariot] horses? 
O Varada! 
47 
Is it for decoration or [simply] out of joy that You perpetually carry the overlords 
http://acharya.org 
145 
Varadaraja Stava 
146 
that are Your weapons 
who are omniscient, 
have all the appropriate powers, 
have made a vow to serve You forever 
and have You as their sole enjoyment? 
48 
Was Your chest the creator [Brahma's] model for fashioning the sky, O Varada? 
[that chest] on which 
the Lotus Lady's face and the kaustubha gem are manifest as the moon and the sun, 
and whose garland behaves like 
a constellation of stars, 
O Best among the boon-granters! 
49 
Good people declare that Your stomach is the [resting] place of the Cosmic Eggs. 
If that be so, O Varada, 
then how is its thinness 
[to be explained]? 
The enrichment of those here in this world 
[whose greatness] is self-created 
would lead to an increase in [size and] glory. 
But that's not so 
for others [like Yourself]! 
50 
O Lotus-naveled One! O Varada! Your navel must be a whirlpool 
created by the rush of rasa 
flowing from Your ambrosial beauty. 
http://acharya.org 
Praise-Poem to the Boon-Bestower King 
The lotus [arising from Your navel] shines as the abode of the lovely Laksmi 
who is fond of Your entire wonderful form. 
51 
That very rope which gave You the name "Damodara" 
left a callus [on Your body]. 
O Varada! 
Under the guise of three lines 
[that mark] has become 
the foremost ornament of Your waist. 
52 
147 
O Lord of Hasti[śaila]! 
The earth bears fruit 
according to the kind of seed that is sown in it 
and we see that [same principle 
at work] in You also. 
O Lotus-faced One! 
The lotus being [continually] created in Your belly 
in which resides the [Cosmic] Egg 
brings forth multitudes of unbroken eggs! 
53 
O Lord of the sacrifice! 
Although I am an ignorant man, 
somewhere I have encountered the question 
"Who among the many [gods] 
is the Supreme Overlord of the universe?" 
We [now] proclaim the final conclusion: "Brahma and the other [gods] 
about whom a clamorous debate 
http://acharya.org 
148 
among the people has arisen are born, O Varada, 
from the lotus arising from 
Varadaraja Stava 
the bulb in the form of Your stomach." 
54 
O Kṛṣṇa! O Varada! 
O [Lord] fit to be won over 
by Your own dear people! 
That rope with which You were tightly bound 
by the hands of Yasoda for stealing fresh butter and which is the destroyer 
of Your devotees' bondage 
You even today wear 
out of love for Your mother 
as an ornament of the body called a waistband. 
55 
A river called "Beauty" spread out on Your chest and was halted midway by Your pit-like navel from which a whirlpool arises 
due to the uneven movement [of the water] in such a small space. 
[From there that river] spread out [once again] and after reaching Your broad hips 
becomes diversified into the streams [that flow] through the regions of Your feet, O Lord of Hasti Hill! 
O Varada! 
56 
[Ordinary standards of comparison such as gracefully tapering] hands excellent emerald pillars

plantain-tree trunks 
and the trunks of the choicest elephants even though in the bloom of youth do not compare entirely favourably with Your broad thighs, 
nor do they impart their majesty. 
O Varada! 
57 
A river of luminosity was born in Your body and its two streams vanish 
at [the tips of] Your two feet. 
Your knees resemble whirlpools 
born from it 
bubbling up from below, 
or perhaps they are two bullock humps named "Youth" and "Wealth". 
58 
In order to kiss affectionately the peak of Elephant Hill, 
Your legs are behaving like the stems of the two lotuses facing downward called Your feet. 
The delight elicited 
by the touch of the mountain 
has made Your leg hairs 
bristle like thorns 
[on the stems] of Your ankles. 
How can the person who sees You 
O Varada 
bear to leave [Your presence]?

O Varada! 
59 
Among these [bestowers of] exceeding delight which do Your lotus-feet prefer? 
the bright lotus named "Dahara" 
[situated] in the body of Your devotees, 
Your lotus-seat which, although seated perpetually, 
remains unfaded, 
the pinnacle of the Vedas (Upanisads), 
the head of Saṭhāri, 
or the peak of Elephant Hill? 
O Varada! 
60 
The toes of Your feet have all the splendour of a series of [sea] billows 
bordering the [glistening] water's edge. 
Does the moon cause Your toes to shine 
from its reflection on the rows of Your toenails? 
or under the pretext of reflecting itself 
on Your nails, 
does the moon [really] reach Your toenails thus making them glitter? 
61 
O Lotus-faced One! 
O Lover of the sacrifice! 
The moon 
defective, imperfect, vile, and crooked on account of being the friend of Siva and serving him 
approached Your lotus-feet 
under the guise of Your toenails, O Varada, 
http://acharya.org

and became purified, perfect in conduct, eternal, and the possessor of ten auspicious qualities. 
62 
Long ago the river of the gods (Gargā) 
sprung from Your lotus-foot 
separated into four [streams]. 
Taking three paths, 
the single [stream] borne by Dhruva 
purified the three worlds. 
One from among those three [streams] 
going through the sky 
purifies Śiva. 
She divided again into seven [streams]; 
one purified this earth 
and enabled Sagara's sons to reach heaven, O Varada! 
63 
Attendants, retinue, ornaments and weapons, the multitudes of auspicious qualities 
beginning with knowledge end creative power, the Supreme Abode, the [Cosmic] Eggs, 
Your own body and so also Your soul -- 
You made all this 
for the sake of those who take refuge [with You], O Boon-bestower! 
64 
There is nothing [to be] gained by You that is not already Yours, O Varada!

Your creative actions 
involving the generation, preservation and annihilation of all the worlds flash forth from Your mind. 
Nevertheless, You descend here [to live] among the multitudes of inferior gods and human beings, in order to embrace people 
who seek refuge [with You] 
and to destroy those who trouble them. 
O Varada! 
65 
Even the slightest trace of desire 
may destroy the discrimination of the mind. 
When that same desire is great -- 
what then? 
O Varada! 
Raising up Partha and the like 
to be Your own person 
You have descended into this unworthy world 
and embrace him! 
O Varada! 
66 
Unable to suffer delay in embracing 
[Your devotees] 
and not even allowing them enough time 
to be purified, 
You, most excellent among the patient ones, were so eager to take them immediately 
to Your own Abode [of Vaikuntha] that You descended here. 
http://acharya.org

But what is this? 
You woo even those 
who haven't taken shelter with You, yielding Your body to them! 
O Varada! 
67 
Being beyond [apprehension by] the senses, if You were not to descend into this world then Your worship, praise and so forth 
decreed by Śruti 
would be abandoned.

O Protector! 
O Varada! 
Hiranya perpetually committed 
a thousand offences against You, but You [remained] unaffected [by him] for a long, long time. 
[Yet] on account of [Hiranya's] 
troubling of a small boy, 
You underwent change 
[and responded] immediately taking the form of a Man-Lion.

Oh! But what is this? 
Long ago, being tied with a rope, 
You wept!

I am being consumed by the three-fold forest fire! I am confused and, not knowing my limits, am able neither to stand firmly [here in saṁsāra]

I do not even have desire for [refuge in] Your feet!

I do not even seek my own welfare!

insatiability [of the senses],

I am inwardly consumed by 
unavailing and meaningless brooding 
over how my sons and others will be when I am dead. 
But, O Lord of Hastigiri, 
there is not even an iota of consideration

Because of the strength of my evil inclinations

my mind is not able to abandon [the world] even while analyzing happiness

I have resorted to the feet of Ramanuja, 
the foremost light of the sage Yamuna's lineage. 
[Yamuna] is from the line of Natha[muni], 
who belongs to the lineage of the sage Parankusa 
the servant of [Śri] Your Queen. 
Therefore, O Varada, 
I am looked upon by You 
as Your very own! 
NOTES 
The Supreme Brahman is described as “unequalled" and "unsurpassed" in ŚvetUp 6.8. 
Kūresa refers to "Elephant Hill" or "Hill/Abode/Rock of the Elephant(s) by a variety of nearly synonymous epithets (hasti-giri, hasti-saila, hasti-kṣitidhara, hasti-dhama, kari- giri, kari-saila). These references (and those contained in Rāmānuja's teacher Kāñcīpurṇa's Devarājāṣṭakam) are the earliest in Sanskrit literature. 
Raman presents us with convincing etymology of these Sanskrit place names. According to Raman, the area sur- rounding the Varadaraja Swami Temple was first known as Attiyur (or Tiruvattiyur), and this name occurs in Putat Ālvār's ITA, vs. 95-96. Inscriptional evidence from the temple records shows that as early as C.E. 1129 the hymns of that Alvar were, indeed, connected with the temple. 
Vaiṣṇavas endow atti wood (Sanskrit, udambara) with a special significance; many Agamic texts on iconography prescribe it as the most suitable material from which to construct an icon. According to Raman, Vaiṣṇavas regard these trees as manifestations of Viṣņu Himself, which he es- tablishes by referring to VSN which contains the name "Udambara" (Raman 1975:4-5). (It must be noted, how- ever, that this particular etymology of that name of Viṣṇu 
http://acharya.org 
Praise-Poem to the Boon-Bestower King 
165 
must have been lost by the time of the early Acaryas, for Bhattar makes no mention of the connection in his BhGD, No. 827). 
Raman suggests that the original name for Hastigiri, that is Attiyur, was derived from the name of this wood, for the sthala purāṇa of Varadaraja Swami Temple mentions that the area was once filled with atti trees and that the original image of the deity (named Attivaradar) was made of atti wood. 
Commenting on the name Hastigiri, Raman notes: "Thus, the etymology of place-name has had a chequered evolution. The simple Tamil name of Attiyur, glorified by the Ālvār, had to undergo a painful course of Sanskritisation to be- come Hastipura and then Hastigiri, and then the latter was again Tamilized as Attigiri! Curiously, the latter word is a hybrid, neither purely Sanskrit nor Tamil. Atti is Tamil (and may refer to the atti tree or an elephant) but giri, mean- ing "hill", is Sanskrit; when the word Hastigiri attained popularity in Vaishnavite literature, the legendary story of the elephant [that is, the tale of Gajendra] was probably tagged on to it because hasti in Sanskrit means elephant. This legend has attained currency so much that the signifi- cance of the original Tamil word, Attiyur, was lost" (Raman 1975:5-6). 
The inclusion of the term "hill" (giri) in the Sanskrit name is derived from the traditional belief that the main sanctuary of the temple is built over a small hillock. The main shrine of the temple, which houses Lord Varadaraja, is above ground level, standing on the top of a square walled-in platform, a raised enclosure 30 square metres in size, and 10 metres in height. Whether it is a natural hillock or an artifi- cially raised mound -- perhaps a Jaina or Buddhist stupa? - is not known, and archaelogical investigation of the area has been prohibited by the Government of India. 
-- 
In the 14th century, Vedanta Deśika composed a stotra in praise of Varadaraja which was heavily influenced by Kūr- esa's VRS. See his Varadaraja Pañcāśat in Stotramālā or the English translation of the same by Filliozat 1992. Filliozat's translation of the synonymous epithets Hastigiri,

Varadaraja Stava 
etc. (Hill of elephants), is based on the sthala-purāņa story which connects the shrine to a sacrifice performed there by the elephants of the four directions. In my translation (Hill of the Elephant), I have preferred to emphasize the elephant Gajendra's long-standing connection with the shrine. "Visible...invisible" (parokṣa...aparoksa). In their more general meaning, these terms may be taken to refer to all of the senses, and may be translated as "perceptible... imper- ceptible". 
According to popular Śrīvaiṣṇava thought, "the unfortunate ones" would be those people on whom the glance of God did not fall at the time of birth. On the other hand, fortunate people are those on whom the glance of God did fall at the time of birth, creating in them the desire for moksa and Vaikuntha. The choice is entirely up to God. "four-fold creative cosmic emanation" (vyuha). This stanza contains the earliest extant Śrīvaiṣṇava reference (in technical terminology) to all five forms of Vişņu. The two categories of qualities mentioned here -- "the most excellent qualities" (vara-gunaḥ) and "the highest qualities" (uttama-gunāḥ) -- are applied loosely, and do not function in the Śrīvaiṣṇava tradition as technical terms. 
The idea expressed in this stanza is similar to that of PĀTM 4.9.2, which traditional interpretation regards as revealing the Lord's independence: "Even if the Lotus-Lady, who mediates their cases, tells the faults of his devotees, the Lord may say 'My servants would not do that; and if they did, they did it for good" " (translation by Ate). 
See also Poykai Alvār, MTA, v. 1: "Even if a person commits mistakes [as big as] a mountain, God will take into account only the good things". 
The imagery in this verse is based on TVM 6.6.6, in which the Lord's crown is compared to a golden mountain. There are two kinds of pundras (marks or signs): the urdhva ("tending or rising upwards"), that is the "vertical" mark worn by Vaisnavas, and the tiryak ("horizontal") mark worn by Saivas. According to Śrīvaisnava understanding, the vertical mark encourages thinking on elevated topics such as mokṣa, while the horizontal mark of the Saivas en-

courages thinking of the things of this world (Aṇṇankar- ācāriyar 1970). 
167 
The two groups of Śrīvaiṣṇavas today (Tenkalai and Vaṭakalai) wear marks of slightly different shapes. Note that this verse does not describe the precise shape of the mark. Indeed, discussion of the Tenkalai and Vaṭakalai forms of the mark does not appear in literature until well af- ter the 13th century (From an interview with Prof. K.K.A. Venkatachari, October, 1986). 
Kūresa evokes a sense of wonder in this verse by the em- ployment of the saṁdeha-alankāra, which involves the doubt as to whether the thing described is "this thing", "that thing" or "yet another thing". 
The description of the parts of the Lord's body in this sec- tion of the stotra may be compared to Yamuna, SR, vs. 32- 36, and especially v. 34. 
The poet's wonder as to whether or not the earring is a decoration for the Lord's shoulders is an oblique reference to the the length of the His ears, amahā-purusa-lakṣaṇa (sign of a great man). 
The Lord's shoulders are likewise compared to a kalpaka tree (Tamil, karpaka) in Nammāļvār, TVM 6.6.6. The Lord is described likewise as resembling "a dark cloud filled with lightning" in PĀTM.8.1. 
According to traditional Indian thought, one side of the sun is thought to be dark, and the other bright. 
Literally, this verse reads "With regard to Your eyes and ears for the grasping of sound and form, the regulation is not like that [for ordinary] creatures. [Your eyes and ears] have the capability of seeing/perceiving all; therefore, Your two eyes have resorted to Your two ears". 
The image of the eyes resorting to (that is, reaching up to) the ears is an indirect praise of very long eyes, the sign of a great man (maha-puruṣa-lakṣaṇa). 
The phrase "melts the hearts [of the devotees]" (ārdra-bhā- vam) literally means "makes wet or moist". Aṇṇankar- ācāriyar (1970) glosses it with the Tamil word iram, meaning "...love, affection, attachment... grace, mercy, favour" (MTL, I, 380).

The teeth of the Lord are frequently compared to "pearls" and His lip to a piece of coral by the Alvārs. See PATM 2.2.2. and Nammāļvār, TVM 7.7.3. 
According PSV, the imagery of this verse is related to the episode of Visnu's churning of the ocean. When Śri 
(Padma, the Lotus-Lady) came out of the ocean which was being churned, she clung to Visnu's neck with one arm, and linked her other arm in his. 
This is the only explicit reference in the stotras of Kūresa and Bhattar to the Tamil story of Kṛṣṇa's twisting of the necks of the seven bulls in order to win Nappinnai's hand in marriage. While the Sanskrit equivalent of the name Nappinnai is never mentioned in the stotras, she is identified on the Sanskritic side of the tradition with Nīlā. 
Kṛṣṇa's driving of the [chariot] horses is a reference to his role as Arjuna's charioteer in BhG. 
A thin waist is a mahā-puruṣa-lakṣaṇa. Here it is especially significant because Visnu's stomach remains thin in spite of His having eaten the Cosmic Eggs, that is, swallowed the universe. 
"the fine, bright lotus" (daharaṁ paṇḍitam pundarikaṁ) See ChUp2.1.1 yatpundarikam...daharam. 
"Your own body and so also Your soul" (atmadehastatha ātmā) is glossed by Aṇṇankarācāriyar (1970) with the words svāsātāran vikrahamumtivyātmasvarūpum. 
Compare with Rāmānuja's concept of incarnation in BhGBh IV.8 & 11. The Lord's incarnations (whether occasional or iconic) are always directly linked to the enjoyment and satis- 
faction of His devotees. 
God is said to have taken Partha (Arjuna) as His "own per- son" because Kṛṣṇa was interested in Draupadi. The Śri- vaiṣṇava Acāryas teach that the Pandavas were no better than Duryodana. Only Kṛṣṇa's interest in Draupadi caused him to side with the Pāṇḍavas. 
"The three-fold forest fire" is glossed in PSV with the words: (1) adhyatmika or diseases; (2) adhibhūtika or troubles caused by other creatures; and (3) adhidevika or climate.

The three kinds of afflictions have their origin in Saṁkhya philosophy where they are described as "internal, as bodily or mental distress; external, as injuries from men, animals, etc.; and superhuman, or inflictions by gods or demons" (Wilson, 1980: I, 200). 
"evil deeds" (duşkarma, literally, “bad karma"). "The enjoyment of one's own self" (svātmānubhuti) is a reference to kaivalya ("perfect isolation, abstraction, de- tachment from all other connections, detachment of the soul from matter or further transmigrations..." M-W, 311). "surrender" (prapatti). 
"By their own deeds, on the basis of their own knowledge, or out of devotion to You" is a reference to the three yogas of karma, jñāna, and bhakti. Even the worshippers of the Lord who approach Him by these three means are ultimately led by Him to His service (dāsyal kairkarya). Note, how- ever, that the devotees attain their position as servants of the Lord not because of their religious practices but because of His compassion (daya).

What do poets declare 
a [real] stotra to be? 
If a stotra is a statement of non-existent qualities 
found elsewhere, 
[or qualities] belonging to another 
and superimposed upon [the one to be praised], then what a waste would such words be 
if directed to you! 
On the other hand, if [poets] should say [that a stotra consists of] 
a good, complete, all around description of real and existent qualities 
then how can they speak [of you at all], when even Bṛhaspati himself 
incapable of such speech 
[drowns] in the ocean of your true qualities? 
4 
My words [describing Your qualities] -- 
which are well-known as being 
beyond the grasp of speech and mind -- are spoken with a watering tongue. 
But I do not regard 
this [impossible attempt to praise you] 
as ridiculous, 
for after all, a thirsty partridge 
does not hold back her tongue 
and refuse to sip the moonlight, 
just because she is unable to drink all of it!

If the River Gargā

rather, his thirst is

Whether great or small, 
the wealth of all people

Who has no lord over Him 
thinks Himself fortunate 
only on account of your glance!

[Since Your glory has no limits], 
ignorance of its extent

NOTES 
This verse clearly articulates the Śrīvaiṣṇava understanding of Śri's role in the creation of the worlds. For a full discus- sion of the Śrīvaiṣṇava view of Śrī, see Nayar 1992:221-56. The partridge (cakora/cakorī) is believed to subsist on moonbeams. 
The notion that the glory of Śri cannot be completely com- prehended by Vişņu (just as He cannot fully comprehend His own glory) is based on Yamuna, Catuḥ Śloki, v. 2. "First Queen of the God of gods" (deva-deva-mahişīm) is an epithet of Sri contained in Ramanuja, ŚGad, para. 1.

If Rangacandra gives me 
the innate glory of having a thousand mouths then just like [the thousand-faced] Seşa 
or like [Vişņu, the thousand-faced Man] Himself I will take my part in the greatness of 
being powerless in praising Him. 
15 
Indeed, the Veda itself 
doubts whether the omniscient Lord Ranga [fully] comprehends Himself or not. 
[Such a view] is appropriate, 
for this very One 
covers His lordly eminence 
with my words which are dirtied by defects! 
16 
The One Who loves Śrirangam 
Who is Himself shining with songs of praise 
from the Sanskrit and Tamil Vedas 
dirties Himself with my words.

What makes me offend You

http://acharya.org

Is it pride because of [my birth in] a royal lineage 
whose strength of surrender [to the Lord] enabled [our] entire family 
to cross over Viṣṇu-māyā, 
or is it because [as a baby] I was fondled at the feet of Rangaraja and Kamala?

The Veda does not hesitate to say that 
even the Lord Himself 
[though] shining with knowledge and speech cannot see the opposite side 
of His own great ocean. 
If that is the [Veda's ] consideration 
then let it be mine as well! 
Because of this, I have the right to compose a praise-poem to the One Who delights in Śrī. 
19 
You can steal from [Viṣṇu's] abundant [qualities] 
and use them to extol others 
but you can't do that to praise the Lord! 
Due to the boundlessness 
[of His auspicious qualities] 
it is impossible to praise Him! 
Even the limitless Vedas 
become like drops of rain in the ocean 
when they [try to] praise Hari. 
The ocean does not benefit 
from two drops of water falling into it, but by falling into the sea

Let me plunge into the [River] Kāverī a flawless flood of crystal-clear water 
overflowing to remove [all] obstructions to the enjoyment of God such as 
the causes and the fruits of karma and pain, which surrounds Srirangam in this world for [the benefit of] the creatures of samsara just like the [River] Virajā encircles this samsaric world with its trembling waters 
for the removal of obstacles 
to the Path beginning with Light. 
21 
May that Kaveri be honoured 
who [thinking] thus: 
"The Father is the Milk Ocean 
I [Kāveri] am the Mother 
Śri is our daughter 
Lord Sriranga is the bridegroom" 
[becomes confused as to] what worthy thing she can do for such [great] persons as these and overflows [her banks] 
carrying in her wave-like hands 
shining piles of pearls, giant gems, sandal, camphor, and whisks.

The River made of gold 
purifies the place of pilgrimage, protects the trees in the garden, wets the crossroads and streets,

in the middle of the river, 
and with her foam crests appears to be laughing 
at the [River] Gangā 
who is roaring [with pride]

May that Kaveri wash away my sins!

Let [the river] that grows taller with the wind purify us! 
Having become a nurturer of the world 
she who is sweet, cool, deep, and ever awake overflows [her banks] just like 
the compassion of [Śri]rangam's Lord 
satisfying with her flood of waters all beings lacking any other remedy without even considering 
all their qualities and faults.

O eye! 
64 
Drink in this pool of blossoming lotuses named the Foremost One of [Srirangam [present] right before you 
[in the Inner Sanctum]. 
Look also at Laksmi 
who is playing in this [pond] 
like a royal swan 
and at [Bhumi], the sustainer of all the worlds, 
who looks like her reflection. 
65 
We have plunged into a rainy-season's 
lush lotus pond 
that is Śrīrangarāja 
naturally deep, clear and bright, 
made fragrant by Lakṣmi, 
and cool with gracious condescension 
like the billows of His boundless compassion 
in which the whole [world] bathes. 
66 
Let me enjoy [Śrirangarāja] 
proud because of the richness of His youthfulness, 
auspiciousness, and beauty 
made fruitful by his own choice 
of Laksmi [as consort] 
Who sits on the throne along with Śrī and Kṣama

Without a moment's interruption may we enjoy Śrīraṁgarāja 
Who creates affection in the hearts of all people by the features of His body 
overflowing with friendliness and autonomy shining brightly from His feet 
up to His jewelled crown! 
68 
In the prime of youth 
rising up in ten directions, 
playfully embracing the desire-granting creepers 
that are the Earth [Goddess] and 
the [Lady] who lives in the lotus, covered with leaves and bent down with fruits in the form of boons according to each person's desire, let the heavenly boon-bestowing tree 
known as the Splendour of [Śrī]rangam take away my tiredness. 
69 
May I reach my Auspicious Refuge 
the Munificent One Who dwells in [Srirangam Who is as if speaking to me with His glance 
and His gentle, sweet smile 
attractive to everyone 
Whose four arms are blossoming with the divine weapons.

Let the One in Srirangam 
Who is capable of bearing all things 
bear my

He Who seems to be saying with his smiling face

"Oh people, these hands of mine 
which carry a conch, a mace, 
and [the discus named] Sudarsana bless [you]. These two feet of mine are 
your refuge, security, and blessing".

Oh how can I understand 
[Śri]rangam's Foremost One Who 
with limbs perfumed 
with the pride of youth's prime 
resembles the heavenly boon-bestowing tree 
which has hundreds of newly-spreading branches offering themselves [to the devotees as if to say]: "[Enjoy] me first, [enjoy] me first"?

O Ornament of Śrirangam! 
Your tender-hearted sidelong glances, 
Your words and gentle smile 
the master [of all] because of its charm

Everywhere in Srirangam for a hundred years may we see Lakṣmi's husband Who has lotus-feet placed on the lotus-[seat],

a lotus-face touching His crown 
and divine weapons resting in His hands.

Rangaraja Who presents Himself for all [to see] Who has a bird [Garuda] in front of Him

May the One sleeping here in Srirangam Who possesses corals in the form

Resembling a cool black rain-cloud 
because He is filled with the waters of compassion, 
bearing the bow of Indra

[shining out from] His jewelled ornaments, 
and having Indira as lightning, 
may the One sleeping on a mountain

Who acquires the quality of a lotus 
because of His feet, hands and face, the beauty of green trees 
by the loveliness of His limbs, 
and the quality of a red flower blossom

resembles an eternal divine garden for [the delight of] Śri. 
85 
Radiant from rejoicing in each other, the divine garland of forest flowers, 
waist-cloth, ornaments, and fragrant unguents on [the Lord's] body 
incomparably beautiful 
because they are in the form of cit 
have bristled with rapture 
from the touch [of His body] 
and thereby increase 
the Moon of [Śri]rangam's abundant splendour!

A multitude of emerald rays

The Leader of [Śrī]rangam's delightful fragrance perfumed by His supreme lordship 
[obtained through His] eternal embrace of Śri and augmented by the sweet scent 
of the breathing of the king of serper.ts has overflowed the limit in all directions and causes the minds [of His devotees] to sink into an abundance of bliss! 
88 
The tenderness [Śri]rangani's Protector 
that causes us to record 
even the very mention of our looking at Him in the lists of rash 'actions 
and which accounts for His name "Puṣpahāsa” transcends our speech and mind. 
O foolish eye! 
89 
Don't engage in useless doubts [thinking] thus: 
"How will I see [and hence enjoy] all of Him [at once] 
[when I am completely] immersed 
in the boundless beauty 
of each and every one of His parts?" 
The very loveliness 
which connects Śrīrangarāja's limbs

in good friendship 
will cause you, [O eye], to ripen into one who is fully familiar with 
[the enjoyment of] all [of Him] at once! 
90 
The eternal youthfulness 
of the Moon of Rangam's body like the season of the appearance 
of the boon-bestowing tree's first bloom, honey which intoxicates all the senses 
of the bees that are Kṣamā and Lakṣmi, the blossoming of a garland of beauty, and a vessel of delicious intoxicating liquor makes fragrant [our] good fortune. 
91 
Revealing His imperial lordship, the row of jewels [shining] 
on the crown and diadem 
of the One Who is fond of Śrī 
resembles waves of splendour 
spreading upward from the moon of His face. 
92 
We consider Lord Ranga's gem-studded crown 
the top of which gleams with 
a makara-shaped ruby 
diffusing the light of the crest jewel 
in all directions 
a lovely [mountain] pleasure garden high and broad for the glory of the Emperor cit and acit. 
We think of the crest gems as a ridge surrounding that garden.

May the face

of the One Who is fond of Śri 
which destroys the pride of 
nectar-pool, moon, or lotus 
and is luminous with crest jewel and forehead curl 
tilaka, ūrdhvapuṇḍra mark, 
and a pure, beautiful and gentle smile 
roam about in me for enjoyment. 
94 
Lord Ranga's pearl-surrounded tilaka ornaments [resemble] lotus filaments above 
His three-lined lotus-like face. 
His forehead curls 
bear the beauty of bees 
approaching that [lotus-face]. 
95 
Lord Ranga's urdhvapuṇḍra mark is so lovely and sweet 
that I am confused as to whether it is 
[a forehead mark] 
or a stream of ambrosia flowing out from 
the half-moon of His forehead. 
96 
Lord Ranga's eyebrows flash forth 
moving in amorous dance above His eyes 
like two rows of big black bees facing downwards 
dancing in drunkeness 
above two lotus-blossoms.

When Lord Ranga's eyes are mistaken for the god of love's lotus-flower arrows His eyebrows 
splendorous like sugarcane bows 
bent over His eyes 
shine [with pride] like a gurukula of the glory of His dancing [bow named] Śarriga. 
98 
[The devotees] know that at the outset 
the two eyes of the Leader of [Śrī]rangam 
were so long that they spread clear up to His ears. 
With supreme compassion 
His entire body is going to change 
completely and in all ways 
into eyes! 
99 
Broad, large, long and lovely, cool white [streaked] with light red, swinging clear up to the obstruction 
of His ears and nose, 
and charming like a pair of glistening fish 
fighting with each other, darting [here and there], 
may the lotus-eyes of Srirangam's Beloved 
take pity on me.

O Wealth of [Śrirangam! 
Overflowing their banks 
with the nectar of compassion 
and welcoming the ones who have bowed down, let fall upon me

rows of billows from Your river-like eyes 
which are clear, cool 
and spread up to Your ears. 
101 
The nose of the One 
Who makes His abode in [Śrī]rangam 
shines like a lovely young desire-yielding creeper. 
His smile resembles 
that [creeper's] fresh flower, 
and His cheeks and chin 
glitter like its tender leaves sprouting forth. 
102 
Out of anger at being caught 
in the net of His ears 
and at being struck 
by the glittering fish of His eyes, 
the great makara-shaped gem-studded earrings moving to and fro near the shore 
of [the Lord's] shoulders 
which have moss-like plants 
in the form of hair curls hanging down on all sides of 
the nectar-ocean-like Leader of Rangam's [face], 
[appear to be] ejecting lustre 
in the form of bunches of flower blossoms! 
103 
May the pool that is the Moon of [Śrirangam's

makaras for earrings

[that neck] which robs the beauty of 
[the three-lined] conch and 
the tender trunk of a stately betel-nut tree, 
glittering as if its [three] lines 
have been playfully imprinted from the golden bracelets 
belonging to the banana-stem arms 
of Laksmi and Bhumi 
who are embracing [Him] with love. 
105 
May the Beloved One of Rangam's powerful arms bestow fearlessness upon me, 
[those arms that are] 
supporting pillars 
for the world's expansive cosmic plan 
posts to which the female elephant Kamalā is tied pestles for destroying the elephant-herd of enemies

the long and ever generous arms of Śriranga Who out of eagerness [to see] Vibhīṣaṇa 
reclines on the shore facing the ocean 
with one arm extended as if to honour him again and the other placed like a pillow 
on the Serpent Chief. 
107 
We approach the arms of Ranga Who 
free from [all] troubles 
sleeps soundly on the Serpent. 
Placed on a raised crystal platform, [those arms] 
which have tender new leaves 
in the form of many-jewelled rings 
golden bracelets, and armlets and are bent from bearing 
an abundance of flower blossoms, appear to be laughing at the branches 
of the heavenly boon-bestowing tree. 
108 
They resemble two kautaka threads in their resolution to protect me; 
they reveal [the Lord's] bravery 
by the rough scars made by His bracelets and the bowstring [named] Śārnga; 
they allured Kamala with a smoothness 
that she mistook 
for that of a beautiful garland and, 
[becoming] a pillow for her amusing play, are imprinted with her curls.

Śrīrangaraja Stava: Part I 
The arms of the One Who adheres to Śrīrangam excel [all others]. 
109 
I take refuge with the lotus-hand of the One Who sleeps in Srirangam 
which seems [to be] directing 
persons afflicted by the heat [of samsāra] to the nectar-pool of His face. 
His face appears to indicate that this hand, used by Him as a pillow, 
and red with [jealous] anger toward the lotus clusters 
[that compete with it in loveliness] is itself the bestower of boons. 
110 
Made into a pillow 
by the One Who reclines in Śrīrangam, one arm touched His crown and says: 
"This crown is fit for Him 
because of His lordship over Brahma and Siva". 
The other arm, touching the knees, reaches toward His lotus-feet and proclaims: 
"[These feet] are the chief refuge of the lowly". 
111 
I adore Ranga's all-forbearing chest 
anointed with sandal paste and camphor -- Lakşmi's house of play with its 
jasmine garland for a bed, 
jewels for a canopy, 
http://acharya.org 
Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 209 
kaustubha gem for an auspicious lamp, and marks made by the bull-like demon 
[Ariṣṭa's] horns for pictures. 
112 
May we look upon 
the Resident of [Srirangam's chest 
which has the greatness of the ocean churned with Mount Mandara, 
is wonderful because of its boundless opulence 
manifesting the kaustubha gem, Lakṣmi 
and a multitude of jewels spreading here and there 
rich because it possesses 
blossoming garlands for foam, 
rows of bright rays for lines of waves, 
and is cloudy with strings of pearls for mist. 
113 
[Resting] on the chest of [Srirangam's Splendour, the holy garland [of basil], Kamalā, 
the kaustubha jewel, and Vaijayanti clearly exhibit His lordliness over all. 
So be it! 
What really delights us is 
the contemplation of the string 
containing [Vişnu's] five weapons 
joined with the nails of a turtle and tigress tied [around Kṛṣṇa's waist] by Yasoda as an ornament of childhood!

Srirangarāja Stava: Part I 
The All-pervasive One's stomach seems emaciated because of [His continuing] dissatisfaction [expressed] thus: 
"How great a burden 
can the earth and the group of Cosmic Eggs be for me?" 
So the lotus from His navel 
is creating yet another series of worlds 
[more] fit [for fulfilling] His desire to protect. 
115 
The three lines appearing 
on the great Lord Ranga's belly which seem to be counting the three kinds of cit and acit reveal His sovereignty [over all]. 
The mark that gives Him the name Damodara declares that He is under the control 
of His devotees. 
His waist-cord is like an edict bound [around Him in order to show His greatness] 
both [as Controller and Controlled]. 
116 
Refuting illogical arguments 
that the three gods are equal 
the three gods are one and inseparable 
the Supreme Reality is greater than the three gods, the lotus from the navel of the All-pervasive Lord 
the primary cause 
of [gods such as] Brahma and Rudra 
establishes the real truth for us that all things other than That One 
http://acharya.org 
Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrīrangam 211 
are dependent upon 
the contraction of His eyebrows [for their very existence]. 
117 
The navel on the ocean that is 
the One Who makes His home in [Śri]rangam 
which keeps all the worlds inside itself 
in order to protect them 
surely wishes to be like a sinking whirlpool. 
The navel-lotus which brings out those [worlds as if trying] to see [them] 
becomes a rising whirlpool. 
118 
What can be compared 
to the Elephant of Rangam's two thighs 
so swollen with pride 
at having surpassed [in beauty] 
the insolence of a banana stem 
a gracefully tapering hand 
and an elephant's trunk 
that they seem as if they have just now subdued the arrogance of Madhu and Kaitabha? 
119 
The golden garment of [Śri]rangam's Friend with a jewelled belt-ornament put around it and glittering with a knot well-suited 
to the beauty of His waist 
shines like the gem-filled slope of [Mount] Meru licked by a huge cloud.

Our mind drinks in 
Śrīrangarāja Stava: Part I 
the Leader of [Śri]rangam's golden garment bright like the halo of ocean 
surrounding the Golden Land 
and a chain of lightning [flashing] in the sky 
amidst a cluster of clouds at dusk. 
121 
I think that the loveliness belonging to the limbs of the One Who makes His lofty abode 
in auspicious Rangam -- 
immersed in the splendour 
of His ornaments spreading on all sides and in a state of intoxication -- 
has become transformed at one place into His pair of knees. 
The two shins 
122 
of the One who reclines in Srirangam 
which experience horripilation 
from the thrill [felt] 
during their massage by Śri and Bhūmi 
rival in loveliness a pair of fleshy lotus stems on account of [the goddesses'] 
amorous amusement. 
123 
Let me meditate on and praise the lotus-feet 
of [Srirangam's Protector 
which have a redness seemingly reflected from the row of crowns 
belonging to the gods 
bowing down [before them], from the minds of yogis, 
http://acharya.org

or from [their massage 
by] the two hands of Kamalā. 
124 
The master of Bṛndāvana which learned to dance 
to the [musical] sound of the churning of curds, 
the foot of the One Who delights in Śri 
is a witness to the happiness of Lakṣmi's hands, 
has an excellence rivaling the lotus, 
does not discriminate among the devotees 
be they high or low, 
and is fond of its role as messenger. 
May that most excellent foot of Viṣṇu bless us. 
125 
I worship the lotus-feet 
of the One Who sleeps in Śrirangam beautiful with marks of the thunder-bolt, 
lotus, flag, umbrella, boon-granting tree, conch, diamond, discus, and mirror 
and with the tinkling sounds 
of His jewelled toe-rings; 
they are [the embodiment] of Śruti 
which again and again reveal by their sovereignty His victory beginning with the three strides 
[taken to measure the worlds]. 
126 
Let us dive day and night 
into the splendour of the toenails of the One Who delights in Śri which are a fresh cluster of blossoms

[they are really His nails]

NOTES 
"Marriage-thread" (mangala-sūtra) is "a thread tied by the 
bridegroom around the bride's neck, and worn as long as the husband lives" (M-W, 773). 
This sloka is the official guruparampara verse for Empar, known also by the name Srīgovinda Dasar, Rāmānuja's im- mediate disciple and Bhaṭṭar's Acarya. Empār belonged to the same Brahmin subsect (Vatama) as did his Acārya and

his disciple. He is reported never to have married, and is said to have composed one non-extant work called Vijñāna Stuti (PTA, 584). 
"Long live [Govind]" or "May [Govind] live long" (jiyāt) is a common blessing in Sanskrit literature. Note, however, that the style is also that of the Tamil pallantu. The phrase "May you live long..." is found in each and every verse of Periyalvar's Tiruppallantu. 
The reference to Yamuna's "removing the thorn from the Vedic path in the form of the persons who argue unreason- ably" is more than likely a reference to his defence of the au- thoritativeness of the Pañcarātra Agamas entitled Agama Prāmāṇyam. 
Bhattar describes Nammālvār as a seer (rși), thus connecting him with the inspired ṛṣis to whom the Vedas were re- vealed. 
"Tamil Veda" (drāviḍīm brahma-samṁhitām). Brahma means "the sacred word, the Veda, a sacred text"; samhita means "conjunction, connection, union...a text treated according to euphonic rules (esp. the real continuous text of the Vedas as formed out of the Padas or separate words by proper phonetic changes....any methodically arranged collection of texts or verses)" (M-W, 737 and 1123). This verse is part of the official Srivaisnava guruparampară. This verse is part of the official Srivaisnava guruparampara. Note the reversal imagery. Ordinarily, Sri is imaged as an ornament on the chest of Nārāyaṇa. In this verse, however, He is said to be "an ornament on the breast of Śri". Compare with KUp, v. 1: "It is known to him to whom It is unknown; he does not know to whom It is known. It is unknown to those who know well, and known to those who do not know" (Eight Upanisads 1957: 51). 
Although ninda-stuti is found in the Veda, to my knowl- edge there is no "praise-defamation" passage similar to the one in this verse. The reference, therefore, would appear to be to the Tamil Veda of the Alvars. See, for example, Nammālvār, PTAnt, v. 2, in which praise is said to be abuse, and abuse is said to indicate respect.

Bhattar calls the Lord at Srirangam Rangacandra in this and several other stanzas, perhaps playing on Lord Sriranga's special association with Lord Rama, Who is often lovingly called Rāmacandra. 
The image of "the Person with a thousand heads" is from PSū. 
As in v. 14, the idea expressed here -- that even Nārāyaṇa is unable to praise Himself adequately -- is based on the sug- gestion that God cannot fully know Himself: "The Lord of the universe who lives in the Great Sky knows Himself, or perhaps even He does not know" (TaittBrāh 2.8.9). "With songs of praise from the Sanskrit and Tamil Vedas" (samskṛta-drāviḍa-veda-sūktaiḥ). The term sūkta is used by Bhaṭṭar to indicate a form of Vedic praise in BhGD, No. 693. 
"surrender" (prapatti). The connection of surrender with the crossing of Viṣṇu-māyā is based on BhG 7.14-15: "This māyā of Mine, composed of the three guņas, is difficult to cross...those who take refuge with/surrender to Me alone (māmeva ye prapadyante) cross beyond this māyā”. 
Bhattar's reference to being "fondled at the feet of Ran- garaja and Kamalā (Śrī)" would appear to be the origin of the later story found in all major Śrīvaiṣṇava hagiographical texts, which identify Parāśara Bhattar as the son of Śrī- rangarāja. Note, however, that he refers to himself as the son of Śrīvatsacihna Miśra (Kūresa) in v. 1. 
"Path beginning with Light" (arcirādi-sarani). For Rāmā- nuja's exposition of arcirādi-mārga, see ŚrīBh IV. 4.1. Praise of the Kaveri River by way of poetic description is a common feature in the DP. For an example containing im- agery identical to that in this verse see Kulacekara Alvar, Pmā!TM 1.1, in which the river is described as touching Lord Ranga's feet with her "wave-like hands” (tiraikkaiyāl). See also Tirumańkai Āļvār's PTM 5.4.9, in which the Kāveri's waters are described as bringing pearls and pre- cious gems (muttum maniyum). 
The name "Golden River" or "River made of gold" (hemāpaga) is a direct translation from the well-known Tamil name of the Kāverī River, Ponni. This name fre-

quently appears both in the DP and in Cōla inscriptions. See, for example, Kulacekara Āļvār, PmāļTM 1.1. "She...who is ever awake" (anujagrātī) is a phrase usually used to describe a mother who remains awake in order to watch over her baby. It is used in this verse to express the ever-vigilant, motherly compassion of God. "the river named "Golden" (kanaka-nāmnīnimnagā). See v. 
22. 
Many of the Ālvārs describe Śrirangam as being in or surrounded by a garden. For nature imagery similar to that contained in this stanza, see PĀTM 2.9.10: "Arankam is... in a garden buzzing with intoxicated bees". See also 3.3.2, 4.8.4 and 4.8.5. 
Ayodhya is described as "the city of the gods" and as "a city surrounded by eternally free souls" in Arthva Veda 10.2. 31. "Ayodhya is the city of the gods. It has a treasury filled with gold. Brahma entered the city made of gold which is known as Aparajita" (puram hiraṇmayīm viveśa aparājitā ityādi brahmā) (Taittiriya Aranyaka 1.27, quoted in Bhaṭṭar's BhGD, No. 71). 
The tall, many-storied buildings of Śrirangam are a popular image with the Alvars. For example, see Tirumankai Aļvār, PTM 5.4.7, in which the tall buildings of Srirangam are said to touch the clouds. 
"Deer on the moon" refers to the spots on the moon which are thought by Hindus to resemble a deer or an antelope. In the stanzas which follow, Bhattar follows the customary route to reach the Inner Sanctum. As a reverent devotee, he salutes each of the icons dwelling in the shrines along the 
way. 
As in YMD 8.24, the liberated souls depicted by Bhattar have the power to roam all over the worlds (see also ŸMD 1.4). In this authoritative text, those desirous of liberation are listed in the category of the "bound" (baddha) even though they live "as if liberated". Bhattar, on the other hand, puts them in the category of the "eternals". See Nayar 1981 for a discussion of the concept of "as if liberated". "central sanctuary" (vimana); "compound walls, verandas and halls" (prakāra-madhya-ajira-maṇḍapa).

Śrīrangaraja Stava: Part I 
According to a famous hagiographical story, Parakala (Tiru- mankai Alvar) stole an image from Nagapatnam and the money it brought in was used for the construction of one of the rampart walls of the Srirangam Temple. For the full story, see GPP 1975:81-82. 
Usually Śrīvaiṣṇava temples have only two doorkeepers (or gatekeepers), but Śrirangam Temple has eight. The gate- keepers of the East are Canda and Pracanda, of the South are Bhadra and Subhadra, of the West are Jaya and Vijaya, and of the North are Dhatṛ and Vidhatṛ (Hari Rao 1967: 101-102). It is necessary to get their permission (by saluting) to enter into the temple. Because Bhattar salutes Canda and Pracanda, we know that he has entered the temple through the East door. 
"Common for all souls" (sarvātma-sādharana) refers to the fact that the Lord takes to Himself not just people of great merit, but all persons who surrender to Him. 
The "thousand-pillared hall" of the Srirangam Temple is modeled on the one in Vaikuntha, described in Tavakara Upanisad: "the Lord of the gods, Nārāyaṇa, sits in the thousand-pillared [hall]" (sahasra-sthune). 
Candrapuşkariņi is a small circular tank near the main part of the Srirangam Temple. To its west is a large pipal tree and a pillared verandah (Hari Rao 1967: 42-3). During the final day of the Brahmotsava festival, Śrīrangarāja is taken in procession outside the temple, and when he returns Śri and Bhūmi look for signs of his having been with another woman. The scene, acted out in the temple, includes a lovers' quarrel in which Srirangaraja and Sri fight with flowers gathered from the lotus pond. 
For "the three kinds of heat", see VRS, v. 72. 
This verse refers to the icons of the Alvars situated around the central shrine of Srirangaraja, evidence to the fact that this shrine existed at the time of Bhaṭṭar. "the supporting power" (ādhāra-śakti). 
The imagery in this stanza is taken from the directions for meditation during the performance of worship (pūjā-vidhi) according to Pañcaratra. Bhaṭṭar deals with the same topic in BhGD in the section relating to the epithets of Kurma or

the Tortoise incarnation of Viṣṇu, Nos. 19-21. Compare also to Ramanuja's NG. 
See n. 29. 
"intimate union [with the Lord]" (sāyujya). See $VS, n. 
42. 
The phrase "who crossed all norms" refers to Narasimha's extraordinary pecularities among the avataras of Viṣṇu. He had the body of a man but the head of a lion; even more ex- traordinary was his emergence from a pillar. "Mastwood tree" (punnaga; Tamil, punnai) "a tree with beautifully scented flowers, calophyllum inophyllum" (MTL, V, 2814). Śrīvaiṣṇava scholars meet underneath this tree on the banks of Candrapuşkariņî even today for their theological discussions, including oral commentary on Nammālvār's TVM. 
"The gesture of his hand" (anguli-mudra) refers to that po- sition of the hand in which the final three fingers are bent and the index finger is pointed up; it is said to be the means by which Visvaksena controls the world. 
A "serving cloth" (prota) is used by Sūtravati to touch up and dry the decorative marks which she applies to Śrī's feet. Alternative names for three of the four servants of Vişvaksena are: Gajanana (Karimukha), Kālaprakṛti (Kālāhva), and Harivaktra (Simhamukha). They are mentioned under these alternative names in Ramanuja, NG. They are saluted -- both in the temple and in the home pūjā ceremony -- before approaching Visnu-Nārāyaṇa in order to remove any obstacles blocking the path of His devotees. This stanza praises the Lord's attendant and vehicle Garuda, who is regarded as an embodiment of the Veda. The origins of this idea are to be found in Yajurveda Samhita 12.4, in which the various parts of his body are described as corre- sponding to the various divisions of the Veda. 
Yamuna's SR, v. 41, says that Garuda is "composed of the Three [Vedas]" (trayi-maya). Bhattar's stanza contains the wording śruti-maya. 
The consorts of Garuda are found only in the temple at Śrirangam (From an interview with Prof. K.K.A. Venkat- achari, April 1987).

Note the play on words: Sukirti gives fame (kirti) and Rudra (which means "the crier") gives "tears of joy” (harṣa- vāṣpa). 
"Group of five warriors" lit. "five weapons" is a reference to the personifications of the Lord's weapons. 
Compare this verse with PĀTM 5.1.9, in which the author addresses the weapons of the Lord, telling them to perform their duty of protecting Him, with the words "Don't sleep! don't sleep! don't sleep!” (uraka! uraka! urakal). 
"the threatening hand gesture" (tarjani-mudra). 
57 Śrīvaiṣṇavas believe that Hanuman and Vibhiṣaṇa refuse 
liberation in Vaikuntha so that they might serve Srirangaraja in Srirangam. Whenever there is a public reading of the Rāmāyaṇa, an empty seat is reserved in the front row for Hanuman, who, it is believed, comes to listen to the story of Lord Rama.

Even today a bamboo cane is placed across the entrance to the inner part of the Inner Sanctum of the Srirangam Temple so that only rightful persons may approach the temple icon. There are four golden pillars just outside the inner part of the Inner Sanctum of the Srirangam Temple. Standing be- tween two of them, you have a direct view of the face of Śrirangaraja. 
This verse is based on Kulacēkara Āļvār, PmāļTM 1.2, in which the poet asks when, holding onto the two pillars (maṇattūņē), he can praise Lord Mayon Who sleeps on the serpent couch. 
"Beautiful bridegroom" (ramya-jāmātṛ) is a translation from Kulacēkara Ālvār, Pmā!TM 3.5: "beautiful bridegroom" (alakiya maṇavāļa). 
"Vessels made of gold" (patadgrahaḥ) refers to the golden vessels into which water is poured after being used to bathe Śrīrangaraja. 
For the nine ladies beginning with Vimalā, see also Rāmā- nuja, NG, and Bhattar, KD, Nos. 28-29. In both texts, Vi- malā and the other attendants are described as holding a chowries or whisks (cāmara) in their hands. Both the

temple pūjā ceremony and the daily home ritual is performed not only for God, but for His servants as well. 
"My life" (asmadasūn) is based on Nammālvār's TVM 7.2.9, in which he calls out to Śrirangarāja "O my life" (ennutaiyaviye). 
The phrase "in order to bring the entire world under one umbrella" is an expression of royal imagery; Hindu kings often sit under an umbrella which functions as a symbol of the unity of the kingdom. 
This verse begins the section on Bhattar's exit from the temple. 
"For one hundred years" is a Vedic expression based on the ideal life span of 100 years. It is a standard formula for blessing. 
"by the deep eyes” (nayana-culukanaiḥ, lit., “by eyes like culukas"). Culuka denotes a small, deep, eye-shaped vessel used in the pūjā ritual. Here it refers to the depth of the eyes. 
The reference to four kinds of persons who approach the Lord is based on BhG 7:16: "O Great One among the Bharatas (Arjuna), the four kinds of virtuous men who worship me are the distressed (ārta), the one desirous of knowledge (jijñasu), the seeker of wealth (arthārthi), and the wise (jñāni)". 
The words "Kamala's eye" refer to the fact that the Lord is very essential and precious to Kamalā (Śri). 
Acting as the bed or couch of Śrirangarāja is one of the many services which Adisesa performs for the Lord. This is brought out well in Poykai Ālvar's MTA, v. 53, which says that Adisesa acts as an umbrella for the Lord when He is walking, a throne when He is seated, shoes when He is standing, and a bed on the vast ocean. He also acts as a beautiful lamp, a beautiful and smooth silk cloth, and so forth. 
Note the play on words: "We are revived" (aśvasimaḥ) can also mean "we breathe again or freely". In other words, the breathing in and out of Ādiseșa which rocks the swing- ing couch enables us to now "breathe again" or "breathe freely".

Nidrā, meaning "the sleeping one", is also one of the epithets of Śri, and is therefore "interchangeable" with her. See Lakṣmi Tantra 8.31-36, in Gupta 1972: 47. 
Compare with Kulacēkara Āļvār, Pmā!TM 1.1, in which Śrīrangarāja is described as having "feet massaged by the 
Kāverī". 
The main sanctum of the Srirangam Temple rests on a raised rectangular platform (Hari Rao 1967:16), which is appar- ently what Bhattar refers to in this verse. Since the image of a cloud resting on a mountain-top is a common one in San- skrit poetry, I have translated adrau as "on a mountain". Properly speaking, however, the temple is not situated on a mountain. 
YMD 5.1-5 describes the eternal realm (nityavibhūti) as composed of "pure sattva” (śuddhasattva), a type of non- material substance that is different from the matter affected by the three gunas. All of the bodies of the Lord, including His iconic incarnations, are made up of this "non-material substance" (v. 5). Note, however, that in YMD it is said to be "non-conscious" (acetana) and "self-luminous" (svayaṁ- prakāśa) (v.2). By way of contrast, Bhattar would appear to categorize the ornaments of the Lord as conscious: they are said to experience horripilation "on account of their being in the form of cit" (cit mayatvāt). I would hesitate to interpret this passage as a philosophical statement; rather, it appears to contain purely poetic imagery. 
The description of Śrīrangaraja in this verse is similar to many contained in the DP. Compare with a few examples given below: 
Tonṭaraţippoți, TMalai, v. 2, depicts Śrīrangarāja as having "a body like a huge green mountain" (paccaimā malaipōl mēni); Nammāļvār, TVM 2.6.4 addresses Him directly thus: "O my Emerald Mountain (en marakata malaiye); PĀTM 3.2.3 describes Him as having "a body like gold and emerald" (ponmanimēņi). 
For a discussion of the supremacy/lordliness of God as defined by His eternal association with (or embrace of) Śrī, see Nayar 1992: 225-32.

The two possible etymologies of the epithet Puspahāsa are: (1) puspam iva hasaḥ yasya saḥ puspahāsaḥ, a Bahuvrihi compound meaning "One who smiles like a flower"; and (2) puşpasya hasyaḥ iva saḥ puṣpahasaḥ or "He who is like the bloom of a flower". Bhattar prefers the second etymology according to BhGD, No. 952. He writes: "In the case of those who have the ability to enjoy Him, He manifests His enjoyable nature gently, just like a flower that blooms in the evening. Therefore, He is [named] Puspahāsaḥ." The latter etymology is reflected in this verse. 
Since there is no preposition used with the word "good fortune" (subhāgatam), gramatically it may mean either "[our] good fortune" or "[His] auspiciousness". Compare the imagery of this verse with Nammālvār, TVM 3.1.1: "Has the splendour of Your face bloomed as the brightness of Your crown"? 
"May [His face] roam about in me for enjoyment (viharatu mayi) is based on Tiruppāṇ Ālvār, Aāp, v. 4: "[His] waist- cord roams about in my soul/inner being.' 
Compare with PĀTM 1.9.2: "Your curls of hair (parkika!) swarm [near] Your coral-like mouth just like a bee (vantepol) drinking honey from a red-lotus flower." Ambrosia is popularly believed to flow from the moon. "the god of love" (Smara), more commonly known as Manmatha. For similar imagery, see Antal, NTM 14.6: "The beautiful curve of the eyebrows, like the bow (carrika) which is in His hand..." and Nammāļvār, TVM 7.7.4, in which the Lord's eyebrows are compared to the sugarcane bow of Manmatha. 
"white [streaked] with light red" (ātāmr-dhavale). Compare with Tiruppaṇ Ālvār, Aāp, v. 8: "those big eyes with light red streaks". 
102 "moss-like plants" (saivalām). The attractiveness of this 
type of plant rests in the fact that it keeps the water clean and pure. 
105 In Sanskrit poetics, kings are portrayed as bearing the bur- den of the universe by their arms. In the case of Śriranga- rāja, his shoulders are the support of all things sentient (cit) and insentient (acit). 
http://acharya.org

Śrīrangaraja Stava: Part I 
106 The main icon in Śrīvaiṣṇava temples usually faces East; 
however, in Śrirangam the Lord lies facing South. It is believed that He chose to lie facing South toward Lanka in order to bless Vibhiṣaṇa, Rāvaṇa's brother. 
The Alvārs wrote on the same theme. See, for example, PĀTM 4.9.2: "They will serve no other but our Arankan, of bud-like eyes, which strained toward well-walled Lanka, for the sake of wealthy Vibhīṣaṇa" (translation by Ate). 107 "Platform" (vedi) refers to the raised platform found in the 
courtyard of most Tamilian houses. 
108 In ancient Tamil poetry, women measured the worth of men 
according to the marks they had obtained in war. Here we have a description of Śrirangarāja's hands being rough with the bowstring of battle. 
113 A thread with the five weapons of Viṣņu (as ornaments) 
and the nails of a turtle and a tigress is worn in Tamil Nadu even today by small children as an amulet to ward off evil. PÄTM 1.7.2 describes the child Kṛṣṇa wearing the thread with a turtle shaped ornament. 
115 Three lines on the stomach are regarded as a beautiful fea- 
ture of the body. 
The three kinds of cit are the eternally free souls (nitya- suri), the liberated souls (mukta), and those who desire liberation (mumukşu). The three kinds of acit are that which is mixed with sattva (miśra-sattva), that which is devoid of sattva, and pure sattva (śuddha-sattva)(Aṇṇankarācāriyar 1969). 
116 Compare with Nammālvār, PTAnt, v. 72: "Some say that 
three gods are equal (mutalāni, lit. supreme), some that only one of the three is supreme....Isn't the lotus flower [from which all creation came] inside You?" (translation by Prof. K.K.A. Venkatachari). 120 "Golden Land" (marma-sthala). According to Puranic cos- 
mology, there is a golden land beyond the seven oceans: "...the seven island continents are encompassed successively by the seven oceans, and each ocean and continent is respec- tively twice the extent of that which precedes it.... Beyond the sea of fresh water is a region of twice its extent, where 
http://acharya.org 
Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe) at Srirangam 225 
the land is of gold and where no living beings reside" (VP 2.4.88-97, translation by H.H. Wilson). 
The word translated "dusk" (sandhya) refers to the time of the conjunction of day and night, and hence may mean either dawn or dusk. 
121 Compare the imagery in this and the following stanza with 
that of VRS, vs. 57-58. Bhattar has based these two ślokas on his father's composition. 
124 "His foot...is a witness to the happiness of Laksmi's hands" 
refers to the joy that Lakṣmi experienced while massaging her Lord's feet to remove the pain caused by His wandering in many places in His incarnational forms. 
Following the Alvārs, Śrīvaiṣṇavas regard Kṛṣṇa's acting the role of a messenger to the Paṇḍavas as an expression of condescension toward His devotees. See, for example, Tirumankai Alvar, PmālTM 2.2.3, in which Rama is said to have conveyed his messages through a monkey, and then afterwards, in His incarnation as Kṛṣṇa, He Himself became a messenger for the Pāṇḍavas. 
128 Aṇṇankarācāriyar's commentary (1969) notes that at the 
completion of the sacrifice (yajña), the bath called avabṛta- snana is required. And now that this stotra is finished, we bathe in Srirangaraja's feet in that same manner. 
127 
Rāma and Sita are believed to have worshipped Śrīrangarāja on their return to Ayodhya from Lanka. For that reason, He is especially dear to them, and hence they are said to wor- ship him always.

If the existence of one thing is denied 
then the existence of something else will be established

knowledge alone is the "soul"

Those three!

[The Buddhist statement that] "The world is momentary and the soul is nothing but 
the knowledge of momentariness" is incorrect

If those things are unreal, 
then according to that argument 
all things [including knowledge and the soul are equally] unreal! 
If knowledge of everything is unreal then that [knowledge about unreality] will itself be false!

Foolish people have taught that Brahman -- Who is knowledge alone --

declared that the quality of lordship is like a reflection, 
didn't he? 
In still another manner, 
the Śaivas 
out of an excessively passionate attachment [to Śiva] 
think that lordship resides in a beggar, 
O King [of the Universe] at [Śrī]rangam! 
Because of Your great affection [for the devotees], 
how richly abundant 
You have revealed [Yourself to be] 
with [Your forms] beginning with para, vibhava, and vyūha.

The philosophical schools 
which deny the validity of the Vedas I regard as [equal to] a blade of grass even though established by You in a deceptive manner. 
[If that is so], O Lord, 
then what will I think of 
the path of those with erroneous ideas who are clad in the armour of the Vedas? 
17 
O Resident of [Śrī]rangam! 
During the cosmic dissolutions 
You kept the authorless Veda in Your mind, then recollected it at the times of creation and provided the appropriate name and form [for each created entity]. 
Having taught [the Veda] to [special] people 
beginning with Brahma 
who was awakened from his sleep, and decreeing the welfare [of all], 
You bestow [upon us] the authorless Veda 
an authoritative means to valid knowledge. 
18 
Šikṣā teaches the proper order of syllables. 
Correct understanding of the meaning of words is taught by vyākriyā and nirvaci. 
Chandas gives clarity about metres, and jyotiṣa teaches us proper ritual timings. 
http://acharya.org 
234 
Śrīrangaraja Stava: Part II 
Kalpa-[sūtra] has declared 
the appropriate ordering of rituals, 
and the clear meaning of Purāṇas and Smṛtis 
may be discovered 
by means of Nyāya and Mimāṁsā. 
O Lord at [Śri]rangam! 
The Vedas 
aided by these [eight disciplines] 
seek You out. 
19 
Primarily, the Vedas are 
the means to valid knowledge. 
Smrtis, along with Itihāsas, Purāṇas and Nyāya, assist [in the understanding of the Vedas]. 
The first portion [of the Vedas] 
exhaustively examines methods of Your worship, while the lofty division 
revealing Your activities, qualities, and glory examines [the way] to reach Your feet. 
O Blessed One! 
You Yourself declared: 
"I am known by all the Vedas". 
20 
O Lord at [Śri]rangam! 
Wrong-notioned philosophers say 
that the power of the sacrifice is apūrva, or that the performers [of a sacrifice] 
obtain its fruits 
by the grace of the ancestral fathers and the gods. 
http://acharya.org 
Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 235 
[But] masters of the Three [Vedas] say that ritual sacrifices and meritorious works are Your worship, 
and their fruit proceeds from Your favour because the prescription for their performance is Your own commandment. 
21 
Prescriptions for the performance 
of daily and occasional [rituals] are Your command, 
and you make allowance for the directive concerning [rituals to be performed] 
by those desirous of [boons such as] heaven. 
Śruti [describes] the use of spells 
for the destruction of enemies 
as a means by which the wicked-minded 
are brought under the control of the Sastras. 
Oh! [Śrī]rangam's All! 
This Śruti reveals the desire of You 
Who belong to everyone 
and are Controller of everything 
to protect [Your creatures] 
and so it is Your eternal commandment. 
22 
O Lord at [Śri]rangam! 
All the [Upanisadic] statements 
such as "There is a treasure here" 
which describe Your qualities, form, and activities lead to the Final Goal. 
These statements 
[describing Your qualities] have no special distinction 
http://acharya.org 
236 
Śrirangarāja Stava: Part II 
from injunctions regarding 
Your worship and its fruits. 
23 
The body resides in its possessor; 
modifications 
which have exact form, intellect and speech [are contained] in the instrument; 
individual manifestation, jāti, 
qualities and karma 
are contained in the material substance. 
Thus, on account of the fact that 
[things] are located (in other things], 
You think that this whole world is in You 
and because of this 
You are described as non-dual. 
Then why are there confusing statements 
concerning māyā, limiting adjuncts 
and modification, 
O Lord at [Śri]rangam? 
24 
The triumphant world-famous Vedic scholars explicate [the Upanisadic statements] 
which declare the non-difference 
between You and the world 
beginning with 
"All this is indeed Brahman" 
"All [things] have That as the Self" 
"All this and I [are Vasudeva]" [and] "You are That" 
[to mean that] the manifestation 
of the entire universe 
is dependent upon You and is Your body. 
http://acharya.org 
Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 237 
You are described as its Soul because You preserve, create, make manifest, swallow, control and pervade it! 
25 
Fools prattle that this world 
has a Lord 
has no Lord 
has many lords 
or again, has a Lord created by people 
according to their own desire. 
Some subsidiary sections [of scripture] advanced the logic that 
[Your creation's] variegated diversity 
is the result of its lack of submission [to Your will 
because it is bound by karma], 
but Śruti itself has sung that 
sentient beings (cit) and insentient matter (acit) 
are eternally governed by You, 
O Bestower of boons! 
26 
[The gods] beginning with Brahmā 
are declared to be in the category of the "created" and not in the category of [divine] incarnations 
because they are slaves 
to the movement of Your eyebrows. 
You are not like those [other gods] nor are they Your equal. 
So with words pertaining to You from Śruti and the sages, such as: 
"The world is under a single umbrella" and "[You are] the consort of Laksmi❞ 
http://acharya.org 
238 
Śrīrangarāja Stava: Part II 
[we offer] satisfying water to those [dead men] who argue by asking irrelevant questions. 
These six qualities 
27 
knowledge, lordliness, creative power 
immutability, untiring strength, and splendour 
which yield a flood of 
countless, unequalled, excellent auspicious qualities 
untainted by defect, limiting adjunct 
limitation, or number 
make You invaluable, O Lord at [Śrī]rangam, like resplendence makes priceless 
a jewel! 
28 
Whether restricted by 
the function of Your own senses 
or on Your own accord [without the senses] 
O Emperor at [Śri]rangam 
You see the entire [universe] perpetually and simultaneously just as if [looking directly at] the palm of Your hand. 
[The Upanisads] have mentioned again and again that Your perception 
self-luminous, continuous 
and without interruption or confusion is knowledge. 
29 
O Lord at [Śrī]rangam! 
You hear with Your eyes 
which function as Your ears. 
http://acharya.org 
Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Srirangam 239 
The Great Lord has other sense organs and uses [them] in whatever way He desires. 
So seeing all [things] simultaneously 
is suitable [for You, the Lord]. 
Those who say 
30 
that the world is caused by ignorance are refuted by Your quality of omniscience. 
Autonomous, independent 
and with just a tiny portion of Your desire, You manifested all [creatures] 
according to their good and bad karmas 
simultaneously, without obstruction and without thinking it a great thing. 
O Lord reclining in [Śrī]rangam, This lordship differentiates You 
the Material Cause of all 
from the one described by the Samkhyas 
as the only witness. 
31 
[Wise people] say that You are 
the material cause [of the universe] 
through Your own body [of cit and acit]. 
Your natural desire 
transcending the limits of easy and difficult plays perpetually everywhere. 
O Rangarāja, 
that desire is Your creative power 
[to effect] limitless creation 
and that [power] alone 
http://acharya.org240 
Śrīrangaraja Stava: Part II 
clearly demonstrated by the navel of a spider makes You superior to [the god of] the Śaivas. 
32 
The untiring strength 
by which you bear the entire [universe] as Your body 
unaffected by fatigue 
even though it is heavy work 
is the foundation of Your own greatness because it removes the necessity, O Lord, 
for Your dependence upon any other cause. 
33 
You change all things 
by Your presence alone 
without [being] changed [Yourself] -- 
just like fragrance from a musk-deer's navel. 
O Beloved Ranga! 
[Wise people] call that quality 
immutability. 
The cause which [itself undergoes] modification is thereby differentiated [from You]. 
Your Splendour 
34 
the agent of action which removes any need for dependence upon an instrumental cause 
is the conqueror 
of those bowed down [before You] 
and the defeater of enemies, 
O Wealth of [Śrirangam! 
http://acharya.org 
Praisc-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 241 
35 
O Most Excellent One of [Śrī]rangam! Investigating the group of Your qualities 
including youth and bliss 
Anandavalli compared one with another beginning with the human clear up to the level of Viriñca, but was not powerful enough to reach its own goal. 
Alas! Along the way 
it stammers as if [struck] dumb 
and perishes! 
How can mind and speech [function at all] 
in the limitation and enumeration of Your qualities? 
36 
Qualities beginning with tenderness, skill, unsteadiness [born of excessive affection] for those bowed down [before You], forgiveness, compassion, victory, and beauty, described in the Aranyakas and preserved [there] like a [secret] treasure [reserved for the few], are kept like a pile of precious gems in the jewelry shop of [Śri]rangam suitable for the commercial traffic 
of the [whole] world, 
O Bestower of Boons! 
37 
Multitudes of Your true auspicious qualities are celebrated because of having approached You 
Who are in the limitless, free and deep transcendent state of tranquillity just like those [devotees] 
http://acharya.org 
242 
Śrirangaraja Stava: Part II 
who care for themselves 
[by taking shelter with You]. 
Hey! Bestower of boons! 
Only You [can fully] enjoy Yourself Who are like a calm and waveless ocean filled with abundant bliss 
having a depth, breadth and length equal to Your own 
and subject to be known [only] by Yourself. 
38 
Gods such as Indra 
who think themselves 
equal to the Lord 
sniff the [mere] fragrance of lordliness 
and become bewildered, 
while You 
ignoring the greatness 
of [Your own] limitlessness 
remain unperturbed. 
Let us not be surprised at this, 
O [Lord] Who delights in [Śri]rangam! 
As to which is greater, 
Your inherent nature or 
the greatness [of Your essential form] are not both 
in harmony in You? 
39 
Because You are endowed with 
the six auspicious qualities 
You, Honourable One, 
Who as Para and Vasudeva are an object of enjoyment 
http://acharya.org 
Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Srirangam 243 
for the liberated souls [in Vaikuntha] distribute [Your qualities] in the following way and lead all people to the truth: 
as Samkarśana, 
richly endowed with knowledge 
and untiring strength, 
You destroy [the worlds] and provide the Sastras 
as Pradyumna, 
.through lordliness and immutability, You lead in the creation of the worlds 
and establish the dharma 
and as Aniruddha, O Lord, 
bearing creative power and splendour, 
You protect [the universe], 
O Emperor at [Śri]rangam! 
O Master! 
40 
You take [the form of] the group of four vyūhas each one of which is itself four-fold. 
Associated with their appropriate retinue [Your creative cosmic emanations] are fit subjects to be worshipped according to the level of those meditating in the stages of 
waking 
dreaming sleep 
dreamless sleep 
and the fourth and final state. 
41 
At the end of the cosmic dissolution when cit is indistinguishable from acit 
http://acharya.org

Śrīrangaraja Stava: Part II 
but at the same time passing through 
a succession of states 
with Your mind full of compassion 
and dependent only upon Your own will [to create] 
O Bestower of boons 
You caused the buds of matter 
in the form of intellect, egoism 
the five elements, and the series of senses 
to unite with the [five] sense organs and bodies. 
42 
Along with their companions the Brahma Sutras, the Srutis proclaim that in You 
Who create [the universe] 
only after taking into account 
the various deeds of the world's creatures 
low, high, and pitiable 
there is no chance of partiality 
or lack of compassion, 
O Owner [of the Universe] at [Śrī]rangam! 
43 
O [Śri]rangam's All! 
Like the craftsman's consideration 
for the collection of instruments at his own disposal 
or an enjoyer's regard 
for his own body which is under his control 
or a reigning king's consideration 
for the deeds [of his subjects 
some of] whom are obedient 
and [some of] whom are transgressors 
or also the glance of a donor 
upon one who desires many things 
http://acharya.org 
Praise-Poem to the King (of the Universe] at Śrirangam 245 
at the time of creation, 
the Creator's regard for the [karmic] status 
of the ones to be created 
should bring Him only autonomy. 
44 
O Bestower of boons! 
Of Your own free will, 
expanding the part of Your own body 
called cit and acit 
which slept during the time of cosmic dissolution, You play in the presence of Śri 
like a peacock in front of a peahen spreading and shaking 
its multi-coloured feathered tail 
as if it is inlaid in the sky. 
45 
Although You have as Your chief aim 
the welfare [of all creatures], 
leading those 
who are on a path detrimental to their own good 
are controlled by despair 
and sunk in the torrent [of samsara], 
time and time again 
You follow the rules of vama and aśrama 
and experience affliction 
[during Your incarnations here on earth] 
just like a mother drinking medicine 
when her baby is ill, 
O Rangaraja! 
O Welfare of all! 
46 
O Splendorous One at [Śrī]rangam! 
http://acharya.org 
246 
Śrīrangarāja Stava: Part II 
If all Your activities are not done in vain hope beginning with the creation and preservation of this fool-filled world 
[only then] is the perpetual awakened state 
of you who never tire, 
which is forever like the continuous stream 
of regular seasons, 
appropriate. 
47 
Punishing cruel people with hell and the like, You protect [Your devotees] from distress just like a good-hearted friend 
who fetters the feet of a madman, 
O Leader of [Śri]rangam! 
According to the "Maxim 
of the Stick and the Sweets", 
[what need is there to mention that] 
Your offer of enjoyment and liberation 
to good people 
[arises likewise] 
from Your quality of good-heartedness? 
48 
Time and time again 
You behold Your creatures 
incorrigible, though You gift them 
with the Sastras 
and with Your glances of protection which sustain and control [the worlds]. 
Then You 
Imperishable Soul and Birthless God playfully descend here [to earth] 
in a state equal to gods, humans, and animals.

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 247

Had Indira not appeared along with You 
her form and actions appropriate 
for each and every one of Your incarnations, then Your sportive activity [here on earth] would surely have become insipid 
as well as condemned, 
O Rangaraja! 
50 
O Blessed One! 
Calm and steady persons understand well that Your birth in human and other forms is [an expression of] Your greatness, but fools, not knowing this, 
show disrespect toward Your birth and activity 
destroyers of [the cycle of] births [and deaths]. 
51 
If Your initial incarnation 
in between Brahma and Śiva 
was to conceal Your supremacy 
by making them seem to be Your equals, then why, O Splendorous One of [Srirangam, do you take these [other incarnations] 
which manifest Your supremacy here [on earth] 
inducing people to the true path 
and nurturing them with Your grace? 
52 
Please, O Possessor of [Śri]rangam! 
Incarnated as a horse, 
You destroyed the obstacles Madhu and Kaiṭabha, bestowed upon Brahma divine vision 
in the form of the Three [Vedas], 
http://acharya.org 
248 
Śrirangaraja Stava: Part II 
and gave life to the whole world freely and spontaneously! 
53 
O Sustainer of [Śri]rangam! 
Enriched with the nectar of the sacrifice 
that is knowledge, 
coming forth in the form of a swan -- 
cool, pure and a devourer of darkness just like the moon -- 
You favoured those afflicted [in samsara] with the bright light of the Vedas. 
54 
O Splendorous One of [Śri]rangam! Lying on a banyan leaf 
looking like a sleeping baby ocean 
You put Your lotus-foot into Your mouth. 
[Why did you do such a thing as that?] 
Was it in order to measure the worlds 
[which You hold] in Your stomach? or was it with a longing for it to be enjoyed 
by the Vaisnavas [dwelling there]? 
55 
You uprooted Mount Mandara 
brought it [to the ocean] and tied it with the serpent. 
Arms covered by swinging garlands, 
You churned the ocean as if churning curds. 
O Lord at [Śrī]rangam! 
You first acquired the moon 
the kaustubha gem, nectar and so forth 
http://acharya.org 
Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 249 
and when You obtained Kamalā Your entire effort became fruitful. 
Isn't that true? 
56 
When the lord of the elephants [Gajendra] 
shouted for help, 
God, the Glory of [Śri]rangam, 
became mentally agitated, 
withdrew His tender leaf-like feet 
from their massage 
by the goddesses' lotus-hands, 
abruptly left the serpent [couch] Ananta and 
opening wide His eyes 
with their trembling eyelids, 
pulled His chest away 
from Lakşmi's jar-like breasts 
shining with saffron paste. 
May [That One] appear before our eyes! 
57 
Homage to the speed of the Lord Who 
when He heard the trumpeting 
of the most excellent elephant [Gajendra] threw His harem into confusion! 
Ignoring the hands [of Visvaksena] 
spread before Him, 
[the Lord] refused his offer of jewelled sandals and, 
neglecting to decorate His vehicle, 
mounted onto the king of the birds [Garuḍa]. 
http://acharya.org250 
58 
Śrīrangaraja Stava: Part II 
When You heard the trumpeting of Gajendra 
spread abroad, 
observing Garuda with Your mind 
which forever leads all the worlds and supposing him to be too slow, 
You insulted him by kicking Him with Your feet and got him to move by shouting "giddyap". 
Lifting him up 
You rose [into the sky]. 
O God! 
O Friend of [Śri]rangam! 
When [like Gajendra] 
a person bows down [before You] 
Your condition [becomes that of a madman] who runs here and there 
not knowing where he is going! 
59 
O One reclining in [Śrī)rangam, You are my refuge. 
[Upon hearing] the trumpeting of the elephant, [You felt troubled], saying "Woe is me!" 
Wearing garlands, ornaments, and garments 
all in disarray 
You came [to Gajendra] 
dancing like a lotus pond 
blowing in a strong gale. 
O Blessed One! 
60 
Having the body of a fish, 
http://acharya.org 
Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 251 
You put the multitude 
of moving beings and non-moving things and Your own pleasurable words 
of the Veda and its branches 
into a boat along with Manu 
and bore them without even a moment's fear 
concerning the cosmic dissolution. 
61 
Having the wonderful form of a fish 
radiant, long, very wide, beautiful clear, cool, and flashing 
just like the eyes of Śrī 
and fond of playing in a puddle 
and in the water of the ocean 
swallowed and ejected through Your fins, You darted about here and there. 
62 
O One Who delights-in Śrī! 
As the Tortoise Who supports all the worlds, You explained the dharma. 
Becoming Kurma, 
and bearing Mount [Mandara] on Your back 
during the churning of the nectar, 
You obtained glory 
as the lovely emerald-seat 
easily accessible to 
the tender sprout-like feet of Lakṣmi 
who was rising up out of the water.

Being in the form of the Primordial Boar, throwing the foaming ocean

Śrirangaraja Stava: Part II 
onto the enemy of the gods [Hiranyakasipu's] chest 
which was dug by Your tusk, 
and embellishing the breasts of the Earth goddess with saffron in the form of that demon's blood, You grunted at Brahma who 
agitated by Your bushy broad-spreading bristles [began] praising [You]. 
You are my refuge, 
O Possessor of [Śrī]rangam! 
64 
O Lord in [Śri]rangam! 
We worship the Lion Who has 
a bushy mane, huge teeth, and a united form 
according to the "Maxim of Milk and Sugar". 
People who have seen a man or a lion separately shrink back on seeing the wonder of 
the natural union 
human and lion! 
65 
His shoulders made moist by the masses of blood 
[flowing] from the enemy 
torn by His claws 
[blood] which resembles splendid sweet spittle from the mouth of Lakṣmi 
who was prevailing upon Him 
to pacify the forest fire in his eyes arising out of hatred for the enemy, 
the Man-Lion obstructs sin here [in Srirangam].

Eagerly bearing the qualities of human and lion 
in the same suitable, although contradictory, place out of an excess of anger,

You caused the disappearance of Your devotee's enemy 
by the tips of Your claws. 
Having a gigantic form 
a two-fold extension 
of the qualities of the All-pervading One You have fostered the [whole] world. 
67 
As Vamana You became a beggar 
in order to remove the wastefulness arising from 
the demon [Mahabali's] generosity 
and Indra's petition. 
The group of three worlds 
equivalent to [three] atoms became like grains of sand sticking to Your lotus-feet 
as You traversed [the worlds]; 
the lotus [arising from Brahma's] navel was there, desiring to create yet another group of worlds 
to be measured [by Your steps]. 
O Lord Ranga! 
The Veda is a drum 
which announces the victory 
of Your activity [as Vāmana]. 
68 
Having become the Bhrgu clan's Rāma 
adorned with an axe, 
You destroyed the kings, 
pleased the group of deceased ancestors 
with their blood, 
and lightened [the load of] the overburdened world.

Having agreed [to become] human, O Lord, 
You descended [to earth] 
along with the Lotus Lady. 
When she made a play of hiding herself 
in the garden, 
You constructed [a bridge] over the ocean, 
and removed all the limbs of the demon enemy 
who was puffed up with pride 
because of the boons given him 
by Brahma and Śiva, 
making him into leftovers 
for a family of monkeys.

O Lord at [Śrirangam! 
We will serve You, [Balarama] 
the ploughholder and farmer of [the world's] welfare 
Who counted his victory in gambling with the King of Kalinga's sprout-like teeth

and Whose activity as messenger made the cowherdesses 
forget the transgressions of Kṛṣṇa.

Who else longs for 
such a child?

In the intoxication

mountains and fire became 
cool liquid 
sages became

senseless trees along with the cowherders became

huge poisonous snakes became

Let cease the counting of Your births 
overflowing with auspicious qualities [as well as] the numbering 
of the groups of Your qualities 
O Lord at [Śri]rangam! 
You delight at being worshipped in this world 
in temples, homes and hermitages, 
bearing all things 
and in a condition 
of complete dependence upon the temple priests. 
Tender-hearted persons are stunned at this character [of Yours]. 
75 
Having thought thus: 
"The Auspicious Heaven 
is beyond the level of speech and mind; all incarnations [are limited] 
to some [particular] time; 
but this state [of incarnation in an icon] 
is for the welfare of the entire people" and blinded (to our faults] by Your compassion,

You soften the hearts [of Your devotees] with glances welcoming to the afflicted. 
You sleep in the [Śrī]rangam Abode 
in the awakened state 
made unsteady by Your consideration to protect the [whole] world.

Knowing the One sleeping on Ananta with his own mind broadened 
by his experience as creator in many eons, Brahma who bathes in the Ganges 
flowing from the water-pot used for pūjā and who praises You on his own 
with the help of his wife Bharati, worshipped You with His faces, eyes, and hands-folded-in-supplication like lotuses bent down [before You].

You Whose lotus feet

With servitude [to Him] 
as my essential nature, 
I worship Him with sacrificial oblations 
consisting of knowledge. 
82 
I take refuge with You, the Lord at [Śrī]rangam, 
the life of all Your subjects 
the ambrosia of the gods. 
An individual soul who exists for That One, I cleave to You Who are 
the glorious Supreme Brahman! 
83 
O Master of [Śrī]rangam! 
According to the verses of the Gītā, O God, 
without any discrimination 
You consider as equally generous 
those who have Your refuge as their [only] help 
[whether they be] 
one desirous of regaining lost wealth 
one wishing to acquire new wealth 
one who [wants the experience of] his own Self 
one who is desirous of knowledge 
one who wishes his own servitude [to You] [or] a wise one. 
84 
Without attachment and without egoism, 
devoid of all worldly desire 
and with minds [concentrated on] 
the Supreme Soul, 
some perform 
the daily, occasional and optional commands

Considering the individual soul 
as the twenty-fifth [tattva] and having distinguished it 
from the group of shining tattvas, those who concentrate their own minds

Those who unite themselves to You 
obtain You, 
O Lord at [Śri]rangam!

With their attachments destroyed 
and with minds made tremulous from the intensity 
of their inherent slavery [to You], 
some offer You praise, meditation, and salutations, and obtain the greatest goal -- 
they exist in You! 
O Lord at [Śri]rańgam? How can this be? 
[For] You exist in them!

Being born in human and other forms, 
because of Your grace

NOTES 
"Veda" (māṇam, synonymous with pramāṇa, lit. "a means to valid knowledge"). In the context of this stanza, the reference is to sabda, or scripture. 
Śrīvaiṣṇavas frequently quote this stanza in order to dem- onstrate the importance of scripture as a pramāņa. 
The imagery of the Veda as lamp is in found Tirumankai Ālvār, PTM, 8.9.4 in which the phrase "...a lamp spread in the form of the Vedas" (maraiyāy viritta vilakkai) occurs. "Jainas"(arhat). Arhat may refer to "a Buddha who is still a candidate for Nirvāṇa; a Jaina; a superior divinity with the Jainas; the highest rank in the Buddhist hierarchy" (M-W, 93). In this stanza the term is used to refer generally to those who deny the authority of the Veda. 
"Manu remembered (or taught) that!" (smṛtavān manustat) is a humorous reference to Manu Smrti wherein Manu ex- pressed his view of the validity of Smrtis: "Smrtis which deny the authority of the Veda (veda-bahyaḥ, lit. “which are outside the Veda") or which interpret it according to wrong ideas (kudṛṣtayah) all are considered to be in ignorance and useless" (Manusmriti 1961: 12.106). 
This stanza is the beginning of a section extending through v. 15 which consists of a refutation of the various philosophical schools and religions. By including stanzas of philosophical refutation in what is by genre a praise- poem directed to the Lord at Srirangsam, Bhaṭṭar is following Tonṭarațipoți Ālvār, TMālai, vs. 7-8. 
For purposes of clarity, the stanzas of philosophical refuta- tion (vs. 4-15) have been loosely translated. 
The people mentioned in this stanza as not discriminating between body and soul are the Cārvākas, who do not accept the existence of the soul because it cannot be perceived: "...the Cārvāka admits the validity of only one pramāṇa, viz. perception, and rejects not only verbal testimony but also in- ference....The Cārvāka...does not believe in any spiritual values and is content with the worldly ones of sensual plea- sure (kāma) and wealth (artha)....He repudiates the authority

of the Veda which, according to the orthodox, is the source of belief in such values, saying that different parts of it are irreconcilably at variance with one another, and that it is therefore impossible to make out what it really teaches" (Hiriyanna 1974: 57-59). 
"contemptible quack Buddha" (sugatapāśaḥ). The suffix pāśa carries a wide variety of negative meanings. Sugata is one of Buddha's many epithets. 
"Is...neither is nor is not" is the "Madhyamika definition of the ultimate reality...viz. that it neither 'is' nor 'is not', nor 'both is and is not', nor 'neither is nor is not'. It ex- cludes all conceivable predicates, including that of non-exis- tence; and the ultimate has accordingly to be viewed as be- yond all conception, and not as absolute nothing" (Hiri- yanna 1974:82-3). 
Bhattar refers to the Lord at Srirangam as Varada or "Be- stower of boons" in his refutations of Buddhist philosophy (vs. 6-7), thus contrasting the world-denial of the Buddhists with the more positive attitude to the world that exists in Vaiṣṇavism. 
Some modern scholars would disagree with Bhattar's in- terpretation of Buddhist (and especially Madhyamika) thought found in this and several other stanzas. "...the ma- jority of modern scholars who have studied this school of thought [i.e. Madyamika] are of the opinion that 'the void' (sūnya) here means only that it is nothing, as it were, since it is altogether incomprehensible" (Hiriyanna 1974:82-3). 
In their violent tone, this and several other of Bhaṭṭar's stanzas resemble Toṇṭaratipoți Alvār's TMālai (see especially v. 8). 
Bhattar refutes three schools of Buddhism in this stanza. Compare with Rāmānuja, who divides Buddhism into four schools: "[the Vaibhaśikas] admit the external things which consist of the elements and the products of those elements, and which have all of them the nature of an aggregate constituted by infintesimal atoms belonging to the elements, earth, water, fire and air, as also the internal things con- sisting of the unceasing flow of consciousness, love and hatred; [they hold] that these are all established by

perception and inference.... The Sautrāntikas are of opinion that all the external things consisting of the earth etc. are capable of being inferred by means of the understanding.... Others [i.e. the Yogacaras] hold that the understanding without [any] external objects is alone the real entity, while all the external objects resemble the objects perceived in dreams. All these three schools also hold that the reality accepted by them is momentary in nature.... There are others still [i.e. the Madhyamikas] who uphold the nothingness of all things" (ŚrīBh II.2.3.17). 
"Rama's weapon" (rāmāstram) refers to the arrow or missile of Rama, which was so powerful and precise that it never returned until fulfilling its aim. 
"The jugglery of the seven explanations” (sapta-bhangi- kusṛtim). Jaina philosophy attempts to reveal the "relative character of our knowledge of reality that is made known through the sapta-bhangi; and it consists of seven steps since there are seven, and only seven, ways of combining the three predicates, taking them singly, in twos and all to- gether. To state the first four steps of the scheme: (1) may- be, a thing is; (2) maybe, it is not; (3) maybe, it is and is not; (4) maybe, it is inexpressible...(5) maybe, a thing is and is inexpressible; (6) maybe, a thing is not and is inexpressible; (7) maybe, a thing is, is not and is inexpressible" (Hiriyanna 1974: 67-8). 
Kaṇacara (or Kaṇāda) is the name of an important Vaišeṣika philosopher; Caraṇākṣa is a philosopher of the Nyaya School. 
"It is in elaborating this [Nyāya-Vaiseṣika] cosmological scheme that the system postulates the existence of God as the all-knowing Being, who disposes the atoms in the man- ner required for the emergence of the world as we know it. He does not create the atoms, because they are eternal like him. In other words, he is only an efficient cause possess- ing the will and intelligence required for bringing about the desired result [and not the material cause of the universe]" (Hiriyanna 1974: 89-90). 
"Fifth Veda", that is, the Mahābhārata. 
http://acharya.org270 
15 
Śrirangaraja Stava: Part II 
In recognizing the partial validity of the Samkhya, Yoga, and Pasupata schools, Bhattar follows Ramanuja: "It is dif- ficult to concede authority in respect of reality as it is, to systems of individual origin, on acount of their arguments about principles conflicting with one another and on account of their stand against the reality which is to be known only from the Vedas, which are free from the slightest trace of all imperfections like carelessness, etc. on account of their su- perhuman origin (apauruṣeyatvena); Nārāyaṇa, who is the Supreme Brahman, is to be known from the Veda; hence the reality of every principle taught in the various systems, such as the pradhana, the puruşa and Pasupati, is based on their having for their self Nārāyaṇa, who is the Supreme Brah- man to be known from the Vedas...It is not that everything in these systems is to be repudiated, as is the case with the philosophies expounded by Jina and Buddha" (ŚrīBh II.2.8.42). 
"soul" (purusa). The Samkhyas teach that there are two eternal entities: matter (prakṛti) and souls (purusa). "...God is here one of the Purușas so that, though eternal and omnipresent, he is not all comprehensive. There are other Purusas as well as Prakṛti to limit his being...he is not responsible, in the ordinary sense of the term, for the cre- ation of the world which...is the spontaneous work of Prakṛti. All that he is stated to do is to prompt, in a way, evolution of Prakṛti or to bring about its connection with Puruşa needed for the evolution" (Hiriyanna 1974:125). 
the 
Bhattar calls the quality of lordship as understood by [Patanjali's] Yoga philosophy a "reflection" (prati- phalanam). Although the school accepts the existence of God, it believes His existence can be known only by in- ference: "The argument [for the existence of God] is that the gradation of knowledge, power, and such other excellences which we notice in men necessarily suggests a Being who possesses those excellences in a superlative form" (Hiri- yanna 1974:125). 
"Beggar" (bhiksu) refers to Siva. When Śiva cut off the head of Brahmā, his skull stuck to Siva's hand, and re- 
http://acharya.org

mained there until filled with alms. Therefore, Bhattar calls Śiva a "beggar", an image of Siva popular with the Alvārs. "Even though established by You in a deceptive manner" (mohana-vartmana). An alternative reading is mohana-varș- manā or "[established] by Your infatuating greatness or handsome form". The first reading is based on the com- monly held belief that even the heterodox philosophies are the creation of Lord Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa. It is for this reason that nearly every Śrīvaiṣṇava temple contains a statue of Kapila, one of the forms taken by Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa, Who is said to have created various erroneous philosophies in order to reveal, by comparison, the greatness of Visiṣṭādvaita. Following SvetUp, v. 18, Bhattar says that Nārāyaṇa teaches the Veda to Brahma, and then to the rest of the world through him. 
20 
Bhattar mentions eight aids to the study of the Vedas. The last two, Nyaya (logic) and Mīmāmsā (a particular school of Vedic interpretation) are not normally listed with the stan- dard six. The remaining six are called the vedarigas ("limbs or branches of the Vedas"). 
"The first portion [of the Vedas]" (pūrva-bhāgaḥ) refers to what is usually called karma-kanda or pūrva-mimāmsā. It includes the ritualistic portions of the Vedas which, accord- ing to Ramanuja, "give small and transitory results" (ŚriBh 1.1.1.1). The "lofty division" (ürdhvaḥ bhagaḥ), usually termed brahma-kanda or brahma-mīmāmsā, refers to the Upanisads, which give knowledge of Brahman and final release (ŚriBh I.1.1.1). 
This stanza is frequently quoted by Śrīvaiṣṇavas. Note that Bhattar follows Ramanuja in regarding the entire Veda as a single unit (ŚrīBh I.1.1.1). 
"I am known/made known by all Vedas" (vedyaḥ vedaiḥ sarvairaham) is based on Kṛṣṇa's statement in BhG 15.15: "I alone am known by all the Vedas" (vedaiśca sarvaiḥ aham eva vedyāḥ). 
"ritual sacrifices" (ista); "meritorious works" (pūrta). 
"Apūrva" refers to "the remote or unforeseen results of ritual actions (such as heaven). Two schools of Mimāmsa- kas are indirectly referred to in this stanza: the Prabhakara 
http://acharya.org 
272 
24 
26 
29 
30 
Śrirangaraja Stava: Part II 
School of Mimāṁsā teaches that the sacrifices create power (apūrva), and a lot of powers taken together give heaven, etc. The Bhatta School of New Mimāṁsā teaches that these sacrifices are worship offered to ancestors and the gods, and their fruits come from their grace. 
"All This, indeed, is Brahman" (sarvaṁkhalu[idaṁ 
brahma]) is from ChUp 3.14.1; "All [things] have That as the Self" (aitadātmyam [idaṁ sarvam]) is from ChUp 6.16.3; "All this and I [are Vasudeva]" (sarvam idam aham [ca vasudevaḥ]); "You are That" (tattvaması) is from ChUp 
6.8.7 and 6.16.3. 
The phrase "has a Lord" (sarājakam) is a reference to the view of Nyaya philosophers, who accept the existence of God on the basis of inference. The phrase "has no Lord" (arājakam) refers to the Mimāmsakas, who deny the exis- tence of God. The phrase "has many lords" (aneka-rajam) refers to those people who believe in the equality of the three gods Brahma, Viṣṇu, and Śiva (Aṇṇankarācāriyar 1974). 
The offering of "satisfying water" (jalamucitam) to the dead refers to the ritual offering called tarpaṇa, which involves "the refreshing (especially of gods and deceased persons) [rşi-pitr] by presenting to them libations of water" (M-W, 440). 
This stanza describes the Lord as priceless because of His qualities. A more usual Śrīvaiṣṇava interpretation is that the qualities of the Lord get their value from their association with Him. See, for example, SVS, vs. 47-8, and SBS, v. 
22. 
The image of the Lord possessing an infinite number of senses, symbolic of His omniscience, is taken from PuSũ: "The Person who has a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, and a thousand legs...." 
According to the commentary of Aṇṇarkarācāriyar (1974), if the term "caused by ignorance" (ajñamūlam) is taken as referring to insentient objects (acit), the stanza is a refutation of Samkhya philosophy; if interpreted as referring to (māyā), it is a refutation of Advaita.

The navel of a spider, from which the web emerges, is an image commonly employed analogically to the creative power of Brahman. MUp 1.1.7: "Just as the spider casts out and draws in [its web], as on earth the annual herbs are produced, as from a living person the hairs of the head and body spring forth, in that same manner, the universe is generated from the indestructible [Brahman]". 
Śaivas do not accept the Lord as the material cause of the 
universe. 
The idea expressed here is that while the fragrance of musk has an effect on the persons who smell it, the quality of the fragrance itself is not changed in being smelled. 
In this stanza, Bhattar combines two of Ramanuja's defini- tions related to the doctrine of causality. See Carman 1981:163. 
The Aranyakas are difficult texts to comprehend. The par- ticular reference in this stanza is most probably to the Bṛhad Up 2.1, a passage that can be easily used by Advaitins to substantiate their understanding of Brahman as qualityless. For svarupa and svabhāva in the theology of Rāmānuja, see Carman 1981: 88-97. Sudarśana Sūri, who commented upon Rāmānuja's GT, identifies svarupa (essential form) with īṣitṛtva (lordliness/ supremacy/sovereignty) and svab- hāva (essential nature) with saulabhya (accessibility) (Carman 1981:91). In the commentary on this stanza by Aṇṇankarācāriyar, vaipuli (greatness) is glossed with svarupa. 
The four stages of meditation are mentioned in this stanza -- "the awaking state" (jāgrat); “dreaming sleep" (svapna); "dreamless sleep" (atyalasa); "the fourth and final state" (turiya). Bhattar elaborates upon the four stages in his BhGD: "In the first group [of meditators], the external senses function; in the second group they do not function, only the mind is active; in the third group even the mind does not function, there is only breathing; in the fourth group even the breath is suspended. In the Paramapada there is a pillar called viskha-sthambha, composed of non-material matter (śuddha-sattva). There are four parts in the pillar from the base upwards and on the four sides of each part are

the four vyuha-forms -- Vasudeva, Samkarśana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. The four parts, with one of the four vyūhas in each, correspond to the four stages of development that may be found in the worshipper who meditates on them" (Bhaṭṭar, BhGD, No.140, fn). 
"According to Samkhya philosophy, the first thing to emerge from Prakṛti is 'intellect' (mahat), which in turn gives rise to the principle of individuality or "egoism" (ahamkāra).... From egoism, two groups of principles proceed: One of them consists of the further aids to conscious life, that is, manas, the five sense organs, and the five motor organs, that is, speech, handling, walking, evacuation (payu) and reproduction. The other principles forms the basis of the objective world, that is, the 
group five elements" (Hiriyanna 1974:110).

The image here is of a mother who drinks medicine herself instead of giving it directly to her sick baby. The baby re- ceives the benefit of the medicine through the drinking of its 
mother's milk. 
"The Maxim of the Stick and the Sweets" (danda-apupika- [nyāya]) teaches that, when a stick (used to drive away the rats) and sweets have been kept together, if the stick has been eaten by rats, then we need not speak about the sweets for we can be sure that they were eaten too. Bhattar refers to this maxim in another context in BhGD, No. 45. 
Compare Bhattar's view of the inseparability of Viṣṇu and 
Śri with VP 1.9.140-43. 
"Fools...show disrespect" (avajānanti mūḍhāḥ) is based on BhG 9.11: "Fools show disrespect for me who have re- sorted to a human body" (avajānanti mām mūḍhāh manuṣim 
tanumāśritam). 
"The...sacrifice that is knowledge" (jñāna-yajña) is based on BhG 9:15: "With the sacrifice that is knowledge (jñāna-ya- 
jñena)...worship me". 
The swan who brought the Vedas to the world has been praised by Tirumankai Alvar in PTM 5.7.3, in which it is said that the Lord became a swan (annnam), graciously re- vealed the Veda (marai), and destroyed the darkness.

"To measure the worlds [which reside] in Your stomach" is a reference to Vişņu's swallowing of the world. While the verbs in this stanza are in the imperative, they have been translated with a sense of the past tense according. to Panini 3.4.13. When a number of verbs are used in a single stanza, imperative terminations may be used with the sense of the past tense (From an interview with Prof. K.K.A. Venkatachari, February 1987). 
Tirumankai Ālvar identifies the Gajendra episode with the Lord at Srirangam in PTM 5.8.3. 
The idea of Viṣṇu's hurried response to the trumpeting of the elephant Gajendra being viewed with wonder by the res- idents of Vaikuntha is expressed also in Tontarațippoți Alvar, TMālai, v. 44. 
"According to the Maxim of Milk and Sugar" (sitäkṣira- nyāyena) refers to the maxim based on the example of the mixing of milk and sugar. When milk and sugar are mixed together, you cannot differentiate between them. 
"dependent upon the temple priests" (arcaka-parādhīna). Arcakas are temple priests who are specialists in ritual per- formances. The first half of this stanza refers to the previ- ous stotra verses in which Bhaṭṭar has enumerated and praised the qualities of Vişnu's transcendent form (vs. 27- 38) and His occasional incarnations (vs. 39, 49-73). In the second part of the stanza, Bhattar introduces the topic of Vişnu's iconic incarnations. Doctrinally, this is an impor- tant and often quoted stanza because it emphasizes the im- portance of God's presence incarnate in the worshippable temple icon (arcāvatāra). 
Sleeping in the unsteady awakened state refers to the Lord at Srirangam's yoga-nidra. It is interesting to note that the vyūhas are always in the state of yoga-nidra since they are associated with creation, the idea being that when thinking deeply, or planning seriously, the eyes are often half-closed. The Pañcarātra Agama texts refer to the time of the temple icon's four-month slumber (yoga-nidra) as a time when the daily temple rituals (nitya) continue, but special (naimittika and kamya) rituals are prohibited.

Śrirangaraja Stava: Part II 
"The waving of lights" (niranjana) refers to the Pañcarātra Agamic ritual which involves the waving of lighted lamps 
before an icon as an act of adoration. 
Both the Tamil and Sanskrit commentaries gloss the implied subject of the verb as Gayatri Mantra. 
"The Golden One" (suvarna) is based on ChUp 1.6.6. "Red-lotus-eyed [Lord]" is an epithet of historical impor- tance in the Śrīvaiṣṇava tradition. According to a popular hagiographical story, Rāmānuja broke with his teacher Ya- dava Prakasa over the interpretation of this epithet. Compare with BhG 9:15. 
The twenty-four tattvas include prakṛti, mahat, ahaṁkāra, the five elements, the five qualities inseparable from the five elements, the five sense organs, the five organs of knowl- edge, and manas. 
Compare with BhG 9:14 and 9:29. 
Theologically, this is an important stanza, for here Bhaṭṭar proclaims Lord Visņu as both the means (upaya) and the goal (upeya). 
In medieval India, kings had the discretionary power to in- crease or decrease the value of coins such as the cowry- shell. 
This stanza substantiates Bhattar's position within Śrī- vaiṣṇavism as an Acarya, called here a desika or [spiritual] guide. 
"Maxim of the Silkworm in its Cocoon" (kośakāra-nyāya) describes the silkworm which makes a cocoon from out of its own mouth and then dies there, unable to come out. TVM 7.5.2 refers to the Lord's facing of all kinds of un- bearable things during his incarnations here on earth. "offered to the gods in the Vedic sacrifice" (deva-vaşat kṛtam, lit., "uttered [the word] 'vaşat' to the gods"). Vaşat is an indeclinable exclamation spoken by the Hotri priest at the conclusion of the Vedic sacrifice. 
102 This stanza may well refer to the ritual of pañca-saṁskāra.

I join my palms together in supplication to Śri who makes fruitful by her approving glances the effort of Hari (expended] in the creation of the entire [universe of] sentient beings and insentient matter.

We take refuge with Śri 
King Ranga's First Queen who [glows like] the flame of an auspicious lamp in the palace of Srirangam, 
the play of a minute' portion of whose

the cherished splendour-filled group of the seven worlds.

she whose eyebrow-movements are the determining factor in the gradations [assigned 
at the time] of the creation

whose footprints on Vişņu's chest 
the Vedantas accept 
as conclusive evidence of His supremacy

make the experience of the Lord's universal form 
at the beginning of their enjoyment 
[seem as negligible] as play in the palm of the hand.

Our desire to praise you

Even [gods] of olden times such as Brahma said:

Hail to the greatness of our words! 
O Goddess! 
Poets say that

the elaborator of the auspicious qualities 
of one who is to be celebrated 
is called a "praiser” (stota). 
This task of praising you rests on me alone 
because you have accepted my impatient words of praise. 
O Prosperous One! 
Let your [auspicious qualities]

Not only has this Upanisad

Seated [high] upon a proud elephant

[In front of him] stands another man 
destitute and shelterless 
pitiably showing his rows of teeth. 
[The condition of the emperor]

the glory of servitude [to Him]. 
[In His play, the Lord] 
is [like] a man imitating a prostitute

to be laughed at! 
O Supreme Sovereign at Śrīrangam, 
285 
[a Lord like that] is fit for your mirthful merriment!

[Wise ones] have repeated that the Supreme Heaven of Viṣṇu

To the person heading toward that place the City of the Gods seems like hell!

All moving beings and non-moving things

the Eternal Realm too 
exists for your enjoyment;

O Supreme Sovereign at Srirangam! 
[All] these things are surely assistants in the diffusion of your [glory]! 
23 
O auspicious one in the house of Srirangam's Lord! [The city] known as Ayodhya and Aparajitā 
[situated] beyond the Highest Heaven, 
filled with beings having a thick abundance

flowing like ambrosia, 
the goal of your devotees, 
which has town guards fearful of your commands 
and tender [toward the devotees]

belonging to you two. 
O Śri!

O Prosperous One! 
They say that the gem-studded audience hall belonging to you two in that [capital city] 
a place free from fear

Having spread [into a bed] the Serpent (bhoga) Ananta

abounding in thick rasa 
due to your state of non-separation from each other. 
287 
O Goddess! 
26 
As if with your own breasts, arms, and eyes, You console your Beloved with Nila, Bhumi 
and His thousand other consorts 
who are inherently enjoyable to you [and the Lord] in the same way that flowers and sandal paste exist [solely] as objects of enjoyment,

Compelled by hearts mixed with deep emotion

the eternally free souls 
who enjoy servitude [to you] 
are like friends 
devoid of distinguishing characteristics 
in qualities, form, dress, activities, nature, or enjoyments

28 
O moon-faced one! 
At the time of the [Vedas'] ascertainment 
of the nature] of the Lord, 
His inherent autonomy 
is [proclaimed] solely by virtue of 
the excellence of His intimate connection with you. 
You have the exalted dignity 
of being the very basis of the definition 
of your Husband's [essential nature]. 
Because you are included [in the definition of the supremacy of the Lord] 
O Mother Śrī 
Śruti does not refer to you separately. 
O Kamalā! 
29 
The word "auspicious" is extended to the Lord only because of His contact with you. 
http://acharya.org 
Jewel-Treasury of Śrī's Auspicious Qualities 
There is no other reason. 
Someone who wishes to tell of 
the richness of the [delightful] fragrance 
that makes a flower flourish 
does not describe that [fragrance] as sweet because it has the status of being 
[a quality of the flower].

The one on whom a multitude of your sidelong glances [fell] became the Supreme Brahman. 
[The ones] below Him 
on whom only two or three [of your glances fell] became [the gods] beginning with Indra. 
So, O Śri, in affirming these [gods], the Vedas [really] praised you, [because] the [laudatory] description of a city and its treasury 
is in effect the glorification of its king! 
O Śri! 
31 
By your very nature you belong to Vişņu; but [even though] the Lord's state of prosperity 
is dependent upon you, 
He did not become one whose 
glory is dependent upon another. 
A precious diamond with its own splendour neither becomes defective 
nor is its independence in any way dulled [because its] lustrous quality is impressed on it by another.

O Indirā!

Other [qualities] also common to you both 
beginning with youthfulness 
spreading back and forth between the two of you, delight us immensely

[Auspicious attributes] beginning with youthfulness

36 
O Supreme Sovereign at Srirangam! I think that the things of great value 
beginning with the moon 
the desire-granting creeper ambrosia 
and honey-liquor 
obtained their status as the residue 
of the Milk Ocean 
because they were joined together with your form which has the auspicious qualities of 
softness, coolness, loveliness 
generosity and sweetness. 
[But no!] Your divine form 
does not deserve 
this ineffective, artificial and confused description!

positioned in a gesture inviting fearlessness, O Mother!

May I bow down before Indira's two feet

O Lotus [Lady],

protect me, a shelterless one, 
with your inherently blissful sidelong glances 
by which the Lord [Himself] 
drenched up to the neck in love

Lotus pollen wounds your feet and the powerful sight

Then, O Mother, 
[for one such as you] 
holding a [soft] lotus blossom playfully 
is itself a daring deed 
[while] your action of swinging on the garland 
[resting] on the shoulders of Hari 
makes us shout the words, "Alas! Danger!" 
O Śri! 
How can this very tender body of yours patiently endure being crushed 
by [my harsh] words? 
43 
Even now your breasts 
are devoid of the defect

Even though the kaustubha gem 
Vaijayanti, and the five weapons are meant for the enjoyment of both you and the Lord, Your Husband

O Goddess!

If you had not descended 
in a suitable form 
alongside the Lord 
Who engages in sportive activities

O Mother Maithili! 
[Rāma] protected Vibhiṣaṇa and the crow 
who were able to utter [the word] "refuge" whereas you saved the demonesses from Hanuman right then and there 
when they were still sinning against you 
[even though they did not seek your protection]. 
Rama's assembly was made 
lighter and more pleasing because of you. 
Your spontaneous and causeless forbearance 
gladdens [people] like us

52 
Sometimes, O Mother, 
your Lover is just like a father 
[wanting to punish his children for their faults]. 
With His mind confused 
[by your beauty and your words] 
when you say to Him 
"What is this? 
Who is without fault in this world?" He becomes a stream of welfare 
for fault-filled people. 
Having caused Him to forget our sins, you make us your very own children. So you are our mother! 
53 
O Eternal Companion of the Master! O Mother! 
You came here to protect us, 
but met with many hostile encounters in this world which is deaf 
to the understanding of your glory. 
Dwelling in the forest

Everything here in Srirangam abounds in [auspicious qualities] beginning with generosity, grace, and motherly affection

O Mother! 
Moreover, [wise people] declare

Having granted wealth, the Perishless Place,

in supplication to you, 
you feel ashamed and exclaim: 
"Nothing at all has been done for this [person]!" 
O Mother! Tell me! 
What sort of generosity is this?

Devoid of devotion

NOTES 
"I join my palms together in supplication" (kṛto añjaliḥ, lit. "añjali is offered"). 
The precise meaning of this stanza is unclear, even to P.B. Aṇṇankarācāriyar(1954). 
In this stanza, Bhattar says that Laksmi "enriches" the Lord. For a discussion of the historical origins of the im- portant Śrīvaiṣṇava doctrine that Viṣṇu gets his lordly status and auspiciousness on account of his relationship with Śrī (śrī-patitva), see Nayar 1992:228-32. See also vs. 28 and 31. 
"Vişņu" (murabhid). Murabhid is an epithet of Lord, Vişņu, meaning "the slayer of [the demon] Mura". In this verse, Bhaṭṭar asks the Goddess to grant him power- ful speech. For a discussion of the role of inspiration as a legitimizer of the stotras, see Nayar 1992:48-53. Phaṇāmaḥ has been translated here as "We say". This is ac- cording to Krdantarūpamālā 1968:122, which states that verbs having the meaning "to go" can also mean "to under- stand or to say". 
For Śiva as a beggar, see ŚRRS II, n. 15. 
In this stanza, Bhattar refers to the people of five philo- sophical schools: (1) Buddhists and Jainas; (2) Mīmāmsa- kas; (3) Nyāya Vaiseṣikas; (4) Advaitins and (5) Šaivas. PuSu praises Śrī as the Lord's consort thus: "Hri and Laksmi are your two wives/consorts" (hrisca te lakṣmisca patnyau). 
The phrase "uplifting its hands" refers to the habit of raising the hands while swearing the truth of something. 
In accordance with the basic teaching of Śrīvaiṣṇavas on Śri, vibhu has been translated here as "lord [Brahma]". While in Śrīvaiṣṇava writings vibhu usually denotes Lord

Vişņu, "the All-pervading One", the term also can mean "lord" and may be applied to Brahma, Viṣṇu and Śiva. 
303 
An alternative translation is "from the headman of a small village clear up to the All-Pervading One, the controller of the entire universe". 
"Showing his rows of teeth" is a standard Indian descrip- tion of a person in a destitute and pitiable condition. "Dance" (tandavam) is usually associated with Śiva, who creates and destroys the universe by this frantic dance. Note, however, that Lakṣmi need only glance, and her cre- ative power is effective. 
The analogy here is that of a king who wants to entertain his Queen. A fancy dressed male in female clothes is mistaken by those who see him as a real female prostitute, and they approach him. When it is discovered that he is a male, the queen laughs at the scene. Creation is like that -- for the entertainment of Śrī. 
"Darkness" (tamas) is glossed as "matter" (prakṛti) in Aṇṇankarācāriyar 1954. 
For Ayodhya and Aparajitā, see ŚRRS I, n. 29. 
"The gem-studded audience hall” (āsthānaratnam), the place where the people assemble when royal business is being conducted, is referred to in PÃTM by the Sanskritized Tamil phrase atanimaṇṭapam. 
The description of "thick rasa" (rasa gahana) is used in an Upanisadic passage which says that Brahman cannot be separated from rasa (like salt dissolved in water). Here the image is used to describe the inseparability of Śri and Nārāyaṇa. 
Bhattar's description of the hood of the serpent Adiśeşa used as an umbrella is based on Tirumankai Alvar's PTM 7.8.1. 
"eternally free souls" (sādhyāḥ devāḥ). Bhaṭṭar's stanza is based on PuSu 3.5.11: yatra pūrve sädhyāḥ santi. The term sādhyāḥ devāḥ appears in his BhGD Nos. 70 and 849, where according to context it must be taken to mean "eter- nally free souls".

Śri Guna Ratnakośa 
The theological point made in this verse is that Śrī is supreme among the many consorts of Visņu, and that the other consorts are merely her limbs, and gain their status only through her. 
This stanza and v. 31 are important theologically. They celebrate the central Śrīvaiṣṇava teaching that the lordliness or supremacy of Visnu is based on His association with Śrī (the doctrine of śrī-patitva). 
"Supreme Brahman" (param brahma). While the view expressed in this stanza is in conformity with the teachings of the early Pancarātra Agamas, it contradicts the usual Śrīvaiṣṇava understanding of Śri (including Bhattar's!), because it suggests that the Supreme Brahman is inferior to and dependent upon the Goddess. I can make sense of the stanza only by interpreting it as extreme hyperbole, with no theological significance at all. See also v. 15 and n. 15, where my translation of vibhu as "lord [Brahmā]" is questionable. If Vibhu is taken to mean "the All-pervading One", then surely it refers to Visnu, and the theological statement of v. 15, like that of v. 30, would appear to contradict the Śrivaiṣṇava view of the Goddess' role in the creation of the worlds. 
The beauty or qualities of a person are often praised in San- skrit poetry in the manner of this verse; for example, “the essence of the lotus has become your face". Bhaṭṭar says that while we can use these typical poetic conventions to compare Śrī to the moon, nectar, a lotus, etc., this kind of description is really inappropriate for her. The description of Sri's shrinking back would appear to ex- press both her desire to draw close to Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa in order to attract his attention to the devotees, and her innate modesty before the devotees who are bowing before them. This verse is a dhyāna-śloka (verse to be committed to 
memory) for icon-makers because it gives an idea of how to prepare an icon of Lakşini as she appears in Vaikuntha. This is the only model suitable for icons of Śrī to be used for worship independently of Lord Viṣṇu. 
The notion that Sri is so soft and tender that it is impossible to describe her (even with soft-sounding words) has liturgi-

cal implications. Harsh-sounding words are never used in Śrivaiṣṇava temples (in worship-liturgies directed to Śri or Vişņu) for this very reason. Antal's TP contains the words irram irukālē. In order to soften the harshness of the sound, when these words are recited in the temple or before an icon, their pronounciation, although grammatically incorrect, is changed to ittum irukālē. 
The idea of the inseparability of Viṣņu and Śrī is mentioned in connection with their occasional incarnations in VP 
9.1.42. 
The son-in-law of an important man of the village is re- garded as the son-in-law of the entire village. The commen- taries on Bhaṭṭar's stanza unanimously agree that the Lord at Srirangam is the son-in-law of all the people of Srirangam. (A similar motif is contained in PĀTM.) 
This verse makes the important theological point that Śrī is a necessary mediator between the Lord and the devotees, and they can approach Him only because of their prior rela- tionship with her. 
This often-quoted verse expresses -- through its imagery -- the important Śrīvaiṣṇava doctrine of Śri's role as interces- sor between the Lord and the devotees (puruṣakāra). For a detailed discussion of Śri's role as Mediatrix in Śrīvaiṣṇa- vism, see "The Goddess Śrī as Mediatrix" in Nayar 
1992:221-56. 
This stanza contains a play upon the most popular etymol- ogy of the name Srirangam: "Śri's stage". 
"The perishless place" (akṣara-gatīm) refers to the state of kaivalya, that is, the enjoyment of the self. Śrīvaiṣṇavas regard it as an inferior form of liberation. Some understand it as an impermanent stage on the way to Vaikuntha, while others teach that it is a final and eternal liberation attained by the practitioners of yogic meditation, but falling eternally short of Vaikuntha. 
Vidhitaḥ, the ablative of vidhi, has been translated here as "on acccount of your grace", according to TVM 5.1.1, where the word vidhi (Tamil, viti) can be taken to mean "grace". 
http://acharya.org

The meaning of the sound "a" is Viṣṇu Who effects the creation, protection, 
and dissolution of the worlds. 
The meaning of the sound "m" is the individual soul which is an instrument belonging to Visņu. 
The sound "u" governs the unique relationship of these two. 
The three-syllabled praṇava [AUM] 
the essence of the Three Vedas 
revealed this meaning well.

In the great mantra [AUM namo nārāyaṇāya], by the middle word namaḥ 
the essential nature of the person is taught; 
by regarding namaḥ [with AUM, which stands]

the way [to God] is taught; 
by regarding it with [the word] 
which follows it [nārāyaṇa], the goal is taught.

Having explained that autonomy, self-protection,

are not suitable for other [gods] 
and belong to Hari alone, 
then [by implication] it has said that 
they are not suitable for oneself. 
3 
I belong solely to the One 
indicated by the syllable "a" [Nārāyaṇa], not to my[self]. 
The word nārāyaṇa means the abode 
of the groups of eternal persons (nara); 
the dative case-ending indicates that 
the activities of my natural state of servitude 
[to the Lord] 
should exist at all times 
in all places 
and under all conditions.

If a person who has surrendered to the Lord 
thinks that the soul is the body, 
then let him learn well 
the third [syllable, “m"]. 
If he is blinded by autonomy, 
then let him become acquainted with the first [syllable, "a"]. 
If he has a mind subservient to others, 
then let him understand 
the second [syllable, “u”].

Aṣṭā Śloki 
Aṣṭā Śloki is the forerunner of the rahsya-grantha, a genre of religious literature important in Śrīvaiṣṇavism. Because its final verse is directed to the Lord, however, it regularly appears in Śrīvaiṣṇava stotra collections. For more on the rahasya-grantha, see Mumme 1987. 
The translation of this stanza is according to the prose order accepted by Tenkalai commentators. 
"The final statement (caramaṁ vākyam) of the charioteer" refers to the carama-śloka itself, spoken by Lord Kṛṣṇa, who acted as Arjuna's charioteer. See BhG 18:66.

Śriranganatha Stotra 
1 For the significance of the placement of the hands of the 
Lord at Srirangam, see SRRS I, v. 106. 
6 Compare with Tonṭaratipoți Alvar, TMālai: "the company of the excellent gold-bejewelled Urvași, I shall not desire her. 
I shall seek to be anything on the sacred hills", quoted in Varadachari 1970:70. 
8 Sixteen important Vaiṣṇava sacred sites are mentioned in 
this verse. 
Karisaila is another name for the Lord Varadaraja Swami Temple, located in Kañcipuram. See VRS, n. 1. 
Añjanagiri, or Tirupati-Vengadam, located in present-day Andhra Pradesh, is the second most often mentioned sacred place in the Alvar hymns. Only Śrirangam is mentioned more frequently. See Gopalan 1972:79-8. 
Tarksyadri is another name for Tirunārāyaṇapuram or Melkote, located in what is now Karnataka State. According to the hagiographical tradition, Rāmānuja lived in this pilgrimage place for a number of years. For a summary of the traditional account of his sojourn there and the historical evidence for or against the details of the story, see Gopal 1983. See also Gopalan 1972:103-4. 
Simhacala is the name of two different pilgrimage places. One is located in present-day Andhra Pradesh, and contains a hill shrine presided over by Śrivaraha Lakṣminarasimha (Gopalan 1972:129-30). For the pilgrimage place referred to by Kūresa as Simhacala, located just outside the Tamilian city of Madurai, see SBS and "Lion Mountain" in the Glossary. 
Śrīkūrma, located in present-day Andhra Pradesh, is one of the few pilgrimage places dedicated to Vişņu's incarna- tion as a tortoise. For more detailed information, see Gopalan 1972:31. 
Purusottama (named after the presiding deity of the place) is also known as Jagannathapuri. Located in present-day Orissa, it contains the temple of Jagannatha which, 
http://acharya.org 
Praise-Poem to the Lord at Srirangam 
according to scholars, was built sometime during the 12th century. See Gopalan 1972:132-34. 
315 
Badrinārāyaṇa is located high in the Himalaya Mountains in what is now Uttar Pradesh. It is said that Viṣṇu- Nārāyaṇa first initiated a person in the eight-syllabled mantra at this spot. See Gopalan 1972:86-87. 
Naimisa, or Naimīśāraṇya, is a place usually visited by pilgrims on their return from Badrinārāyaṇa. There is no ancient temple there; rather, God is said to dwell there in the form of the forest. See Gopalan 1972:84-5. 
Śrīmaddvārka, located in what is now Rajasthan State, is built near the ancient city associated with Kṛṣṇa which, as is stated in the Purāņas, was submerged in the sea. See Gopalan 1972:89. 
Prayag, known as Allahabad in more recent times, is lo- cated in present-day Uttar Pradesh. It is the site of the con- fluence of the three rivers of Ganga, Yamuna, and the un- derground Sarasvati. See Gopalan 1972:134-35. 
Mathura, on the banks of the Yamuna River in what is now Uttar Pradesh, is associated with Lord Kṛṣṇa. The ancient shrines were destroyed at the time of the Muslim in- vasions. See Gopalan 1972:89-91. 
Ayodhya, situated in present-day Uttar Pradesh, is the birthplace of Lord Rama. See Gopalan 1972:83-84. 
Gaya is located on the Phalguni river in present-day Bihar, and it contains a number of important shrines including one to the feet of Viṣṇu and one to the Lord of Vaikuntha. See Gopalan 1972:135. 
Puskara is located in present-day Rajasthan, about eight miles from Ajmer. Along with Añjanagiri and Salagrāma- giri, it is regarded as a svayamvyaktha -sthala, that is, a place holy from the beginning of time. The ancient shrine is in honour of Sri Venugopala, and the sanctity of the place is said to be described in Rāmāyaṇa and Mahābhārata. See Gopalan 1972:137-39. 
Sālagrāmagiri, located in present-day Nepal, is sixty miles west of Kathmandu on the banks of the Gandaki River. See Gopalan 1972:85-86.

"lord of the elephants", who was granted lib- eration by Lord Visņu. Gajendra was caught hold of by an alligator as powerful as him- self. Absolutely helpless to rescue himself, he resorted to Lord Visņu as his protector and praised Him. When Gajendra saw Lord Vişņu appear in the sky riding on His vehi- cle Garuda, he lifted up his trunk holding a lotus which he offered in worship. Lord Viṣṇu rushed to Gajendra's rescue. Favoured by the Lord's grace, he immedi- ately attained liberation. This story likely originated in the milieu of Southern Vaiṣṇavism because, while Gajendra figures prominently in the Alvārs' poems, his story does not appear in VP. It is, however, prominent in the later Sanskrit text com- posed in the South, BhP. Gajendra is a much-revered paradigmatic devotee for the Śrīvaiṣṇava community. For his full story, see BhP 8.2-4.

The king's angry son was given a boon for having worshipped Siva, and he chose to have a demoness rise up to kill Kṛṣṇa. Knowing that the king's son and Śiva were responsible for the demoness, Kṛṣṇa, who was playing with dice for sport, had his discus Sudarsana attack her with its circle of flames.
