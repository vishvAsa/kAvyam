tadh VaishNavam padam udAram udAharAma: || 
The previous slOkam focused on the Dhivya MangaLa Vigraham of the Lord.  This one focuses on the DhivyAthma Svaroopam based on the many Pra mANams from Sruthis.  

MEANING: 

We attribute paramAthmA’s Svaroopam as belonging to that of VishNu  (VaishNavam), when it is changeless, eternal, unseeable by the physical eyes,  free from name and form, ungraspable by the mind, indefinable as this or that,  undividable into two, subtler than subtle to preside as indweller in all sentient  and insentient and gigantic in size to rule all the universe.  

COMMENTS: 

The usage of “VaishNavam Padham” by KurEsar permits us to conclude that  Bhagavath (dhivyAthma) Svaroopam, Sri Vaikuntam and the Lord’s sacred  feet are being referred to. All the adjectives used in this slOkam are applicable  to all the three (Svaroopam, SthAnam and Thiruvadi). In VedArtha Sangra 
ham, AchArya RaamAnuja has interpreted Sri VaikuNTam along these lines.  
The PramANam for the adjectives associated with the dhivyAthma svaroopam  comes from the following Sruthi Passage:  
Yath Tath adhrEsayam agrAhyam agOthram avarNam achakshus-srOthram srOthram  tadhapANipaadham, nithyam Vibhum sarvagatham susookshmam tad- tadhapANipaadham, nithyam Vibhum sarvagatham susookshmam tad havyayam yadh paripasyanthi dheerA: havyayam yadh paripasyanthi dheerA: ———-(MundakOpanishad) (MundakOpanishad)

didly on the siras of VedAs

Lord’s Dhivya tEjas being accessi 
ble to us is an indication of His  
great vaathsalyam for us as those  
who sought His protection.  

COMMENTS: 

The pramANams for words and  
word groups used in this slOkam  
come from Swamy AlavanthAr’s  
SthOthra Rathnam and Srutha  
PrakAsikai of Sri Sudarsana Soori:  
ParamdhAman

First line of this seventh slOkam: “yann-Moordhni mE sruthi-sirassu cha  bhAthi” (SthOthra Rathnam), “Yasccha MoordhA SaThArE”; (Sri VaradarAja  Sthavam of KurEsar).  
Aasritha Vaathsalyam: The visEsha Preethi of the Lord is attested by many  pramANams: “dhOshAnAdhara snEha:”and “dhOshEshvapi guNathva Buddhi:”  in Srutha PrakAsikai.

MEANING: 

adiyEn knows fully well that I am unqualified to engage in eulogizing the Lord  and even then, adiyEn engages in such an act shamelessly and utter words in  deep affection for the sacred feet of the all pervasive VishNu NaarAyaNan.  Even if the waters of Ganga are licked by a dog, no one declares that GangA  theertham has been polluted by the tongue of the dog and therefore, it is not  sacred. As for the lowly dog, its thirst has been quenched by the waters of the  sacred Ganga River.  

COMMENTS: 

KurEsar (AzhwAn) has lowered himself before the Lord out of his enormous  Bhakthi for Him. It is common for the AzhwArs to compare themselves to the  lowly dogs while addressing their Lord: “NaayinEn”. The comparison of the  dog quenching its thirst with the sacred waters of Ganga has been referred  also in KurEsar’s Sri Sthavam: “dhushyEth saa thu na thAvathA nahi Sunaa  leeDAapi BhagIraTee”.

MEANING: 

The auspicious attributes of the Lord, who defeats the asurAs and engages in  the sport of creating, protecting and destroying the worlds have gone beyond  any one’s ability to count them by word or mind. Even then, the eulogizing of a  small portion of them is sufficient to quench my desire for engaging in such an  effort. For a thirsty worm, is it not sufficient to quench its thirst by taking a  small drop of water from the vast water shed?  

COMMENTS: 

When describing one of the guNams of BhagavAn, the Upanishad declares:  “yathO vaachO nivartanthE aprApya manasA saha” (The speech united with  mind stepped back in failure, when they attempted to describe the Aanandha  guNam of the Lord). KurEsar has this Upanishadic passage in mind, when he  observes here: “guNEshu iyatthA sankhyA cha vaang- manasa gOcharam athy 
abhUthAm”.

MEANING: 

Oh Lord HayagrIva Bhagavann! With fal 
tering voices drenched by love, the an 
cient mahA purushAs like AzhwArs and  
AchAryAs eulogized You with sweet  
words. The salutation of adiyEn, who is  
least qualified to engage in such an  
eulogy, becomes a hollow and false one  
compared to those of the AzhwArs and  
AchAryAs. Indeed my feeble and insin 
cere efforts to praise You highlight Your  
noble guNam of forbearance.  

COMMENTS: 

Through their overflowing love for the  
Lord, ancient great ones such as  
BhIshma, Narada and PrahlAdha eulo 
gized the Lord with choked voices.  
AazhwArs like SaThakOpan and Thiru 
mangai assumed female roles to express  
their adoration of the Lord. KurEsar de 
scribes the sweet experiences of the Pu 
rANa PurushAs that flew as delectable  
yOga hayagrIvar eulogy as: “preEma aardra vihvala gira: 
19  
purANaa: Purushaa: madhurai: vachOpi: thvAm thushtuvu:” In a mood of stat ing his unfitness (NaichyAnusandhAnam) to follow the path of the noble Sages  and AzhwArs, KurEsar points out that his efforts are deceptive and they are  testaments to the efficacy of the Lord’s KshamA guNam (forbearance).

MEANING: 

Oh Lord! The noble assemblies of the three vEdAs, which are revered at all  yugAs, are known as Your commands. Is it not so that the aasthikAs have ac cepted them as the cardinal pramANams (valid knowledge) for comprehend ing the tatthvams, which are beyond the analysis by our senses? Due to the  many blemishes that Para mathams like Jainam and Bhouddham, they take on  false garbs and pretend to be based on pramANams. The VedAs and Vaidhika  mathams however are rooted in PramANams and are therefore celebrated as  ancient and totally devoid of any blemishes.  

COMMENTS: 

This slOkam was created by KurEsar to remind every one that the VedAs head  all PramANams and that Vaidhika mathams based on Veda PramANams are  the ones that are safe to follow for gaining the supreme goal of life, viz, MOk sham. Vedams are the commands of the Lord (Sruthi smruthi: MamaivAj~nA).  Our Lord says further that one who transgresses them is an avaishNavan even  if he was His devotee (Aaj~nAcchEdhee Mama dhrOhi MadhbhakthOapi na  VaishNava:). The Vedams are counted as Triad (thrayee) here although they  
are four in number. The reason is that the fourth Vedam, AtharvaNam is in cluded in the three.

MEANING: 

Oh Lord! You are like a hidden treasure for all chEtanams. You are reached by  a few fortunate. For others, You are unattainable even with strenuous efforts.  In their successful efforts to attain you, the fortunate few follow the ancient  Vedic path. The others fail to attain You as a result of following Veda BhAhya  mathams (Para Mathams that do not accept Vedam as PramANam).  

COMMENTS: 

There are those who suffer in poverty, while having untold wealth of the Lord  inside them as the indweller. Then there are those, who recognize the pres ence of the Lord in their heart lotuses and perform upAya anushtAnam and  break the bonds of SamsAram. The second category of the fortunate ones is  saluted by KurEsar as “kruthina: sukrithina:” ChaNdhOgya Upanishad (8.3.2)  describes the unfortunate ones, who fail to realize the indwelling Lord and the  consequences of such failure this way: “Just as people, who do not know the  place where treasure or gold is hidden, do not get it, though they move on the  very ground under which the gold is hidden. In the same way, all these  Jeevans though they go to the Supreme Lord day in and day out (during  Sushupthi/sleep without dream) do not get to know that indwelling Brah man.” KurEsar points out those, who perform upAya anushtAnam (Bhakthi or  Prapatthi yOgam) along the lines instructed by the VedAs will gain this hidden  treasure and enjoy BrahmAnandham. Those who reject VedAs (Bhouddhaas  and JainAs) are also the property (VibhUthi) of the Lord. They have failed in

MEANING: 

The Lord’s sport is mysterious indeed! Alas! Those with deplorable attitude at tain the status of misinterpretation of the true 
meanings of VedAs due to their  sins. They destroy themselves in spite of the fact that they celebrate the Ve dAs and yet end up misinterpreting their 

meanings. They gain distorted vi sions and acquire the title of kudrushtis. Their mind gets polluted (kudhrushti vinivishta dhiya:) and they end up in narakam.  


COMMENTS: 

They are Vedic Scholars all right and yet they develop viparItha Jn~Anam and  Kudhrushti and end up interpreting the Vedic passages such as KapyAsa  Sruthi. One of the early AchAryAs of Sri RaamAnuja (Yaadhava PrakAsar) in terpreted KapyAsa Sruthi in an abominable way and hurt Sri RaamAnujA very  much. Sri RaamAnuja corrected Yaadhava PrakAsa and parted with him.

MEANING: 

There are two kinds of people: One does not accept Vedam as PramANam  (valid knowledge) and are known as Veda BhAhyars; the other accepts VedAs  as PramANam but interprets their 
meanings in an erroneous manner. Both of  them land in the bottomless SamsAram. Oh Lord! Your benevolent glances do  not fall on them. There is no difference between these two (Veda BhAhyan  and Kudhrushti). One is like the deluded person, who runs after mirage, en 

ters the forest and is eaten up by the beasts of the forest; the other is like a  fool, who enters the river at forbidden places (bathing ghats not recom mended by AchAryAs) and loses his life to crocodiles. There is no difference  between the two in their stupidities. Sruthi vaakyam says in this context: “andham tama: pravisanthi yEavidhyAm upAsathE”

MEANING: 

In the previous slOkams, KurEsar instructed us that BhagavAn can be compre hended only with Veda manthrams and not by false sources in opposition to  the VedAs. In this slOkam, KurEsar instructs us that Smruthis, Sath  Saasthrams, Saathvika PurANams and IthihAsams (UpabrahmaNams) act as  instruments to interpret correctly the true 
meanings of the VedAs.  

Swamy KurEsar says here: “With minds filled with profound Bhakthi for You,  the scholars with pure mind have used MeemAsa Saasthram, Manu Smruthi  passages to comprehend the inner 
meanings of the Veda mantrams just as the  Sun’s light is used to recognize the various objects clearly”. These upAyams to  understand the true 

meanings of the Veda Mantrams have been given to us by  the Lord (BhavathA nisrutai: uchithai: upAyai:).

MEANING: 

Oh Lord! For those, who are not blessed with Bhakthi at your lotus feet, they  will not get clarity about the Sruthi, Smruthi passages. When the eyes are not  treated with the lotion (collyrium) for destroying the bile-generated disease,  even the Sun’s rays won’t be of help to know the true color of the white conch.  

COMMENTS: 

Here KurEsar is referring to the dhurbhAgyam (misfortune) of those, who are  devoid of Bhakthi for the lotus feet of the Lord (yE thu thvadhangri  saraseeruha bhakthiheenA:). They wont get clarity about the 
meanings of the  Sruthis and Smruthis (tEshAm yEva ameebhi: api yaTArTa bOdhA: na). For a  man with bile disease, every thing will look yellow and even the bright Sun’s  rays will not help him recognize that the conch before him has the white color.  

Swamy Desikan has referred to this analogy in SubhAshitha Neevi: “PitthEna  Paanchajanyam peetham pasyan bhishajyathu kam”. It is thus clear that  SaasthrArTams will become evident only to those for those with true Bhakthi  for the Lord.

This slOkam is not found in many commentaries except in Sri Parakaala  Matam palm leaves. SrivathsAngAcchAr Swamy has included it here since it  has no conflict with SaasthrArTams. 

MEANING: 

Oh Lord meditated upon by the residents of the three worlds! Only Bhakthi for  You can bless one with the intellect to comprehend the VedArTams. Bhakthi  for You alone permits one to know your Svaroopam and limitless glories. That  Bhakthi alone helps one comprehend you as the One to be known by the Veda  Manthrams and to have your vision during DhyAnam as well as being united  with you. “VedArTa dhee: Bhakthita yEva labhyA”. EmperumAn's sankalpam,  AchArya KatAksham and Nija Bhakthi and the help from the true Vedic schol 
ars can help us comprehend a little the limitless auspicious attributes of the  Lord.

MEANING: 

Oh Achyutha! Some (SaivAs) state that Sivan is the Supreme God because  some purANAs and AagamAs address Him as Isan, Iswaran and IsAnan. For  strengthening that point of view, one has to look for valid Support from Rg,  Yajus and Saama Vedams. Those three Vedams are focused on you. Those Ve 
dam specifically salute you as: “Pathim viswasyAthmEswaram sAsvatham  Shivam Achyutham”. Other Smruthi passages recognize You as  “tameeswarANAm Paramam MahEswaram”. Therefore, when Vedam says  Iswaran, it refers to EmprumAn only.

MEANING: 

Oh Sriman NaarAyaNa! VaikuNTha NaaTha! We conclude that you and You  
  
31    
  
  

alone is the ParamEswaran and worship you with the help of PramANams from  the Vedaas. You became the One, who is subtler than “the subtlest” and  grander than “the grandest”. You gave birth to the sentient and the insen tient universe and entered inside all of them to direct them. You are indicated  by the one lettered PraNavam, which is the root and the essence of all the  Vaachaka sabdhams of Vedaas.  

COMMENTS: 

Taittiriya Upanishad in the NaarAyaNAnuvAkam section described the Sva roopa-Roopa-GuNams of the Lord: 
“aNOraNeeyAn MahathO MaheeyAn aathmAasya janthOr-nihithO guhA yAm” (smaller than the smallest and larger than the largest) and concludes  with “prasAdhAn-mahimAnam Isam” indicating that Sriman NaarAyaNan is  the Isan/Iswaran/ ParamEswaran (Supreme Lord).  
sadagopan.org  
KurEsar concludes here therefore: “tvAm thu vayam ParamEswaram aaman Ama: (We recognize You as our Supreme Lord based on Veda Manthrams).  That Supreme Being as the one embodiment of the single lettered PraNavam  is saluted here by KurEsar:  
tamm VedAthmaka PraNava-kAraNa varNa-vAchyam  
tvAm thu vayam ParamEswaram aamanAma:  
When KurEsar salutes the Lord as “VedAthmaka praNava kaaraNa varNa  vaachyam”, it is clear that PraNavam cannot refer to any one other than  EmperumAn.

Even Brahma, Rudran and  others have realized their own existence through the power of your benevo lent glances (BrahmAdhaya: api bhavadhIkshaNa labdha sattaa:).

COMMENTS: 

sadagopan.org  
When KurEsar uses the term “nithya:” he has in mind the Sruthi passages:  “nithyO nithyAnAm chEtanas-chEtanAnAm”. KurEsar selects the Vedic passage  of “Hreesccha tE Lakshmeesccha Pathnyou” as PramANam, when he selects  the words “DharaNidhara - Urjitha SrI:” to salute the Lord as the divine con 
sort of BhUmi Devi and MahA Lakshmi.

MEANING: 

You are the Master of the past, future and present (BhUtha bhavya bhavadee san). You are saluted as one, who has no Master (aneesan). You are recog nized as reclining in the middle of the Milky Ocean (antha: samudra nilayan).  You are saluted as One with multitudes of roopam/forms (anantha roopan).  As the Supreme Being of such glorious attributes and as the divine consort of  the Mother of the beings of the three worlds, you become the thousand headed Purushan visualized by the Purusha Sooktham of the VedAs.  

COMMENTS: 

Vedam states: “na tasyEsa kascchana” (There is no Master for the Lord. He is  His own Master). KurEsar salutes in this context as: “Yamm aneesam aahu:”  The roopam of the Lord resting in the middle of the milky ocean is Padhma nAbhan. KurEsar’s Sruthi PramANams for Salutation of KsheerAbdhi NaaTan  as “Yamm antha: samudhra nilayam” are:  
1. “ambasya paarE”, “ambasya paarE”,  
2. “SamudrEntham Visvasambhuvam”, “SamudrEntham Visvasambhuvam”,  
3. “yamantha SamudhrE kavayO vayanthi” 
The Lord’s countless forms (ananta roopams) are based on the following  Sruthi PramANams: “tadhEkam avyaktham ANANTHA ROOPAM, KrishNa  roopANi ANANTHAANI”. Swamy Desikan refers later to the 77 roopams of Lord  Narasimhan in Gadhya BhAshyam. KurEsar saluted MahA Lakshmi as “thrilOka 
36  

Jananee”. The pramANam here is from VishNu PurANam: “SnapayAm chakrirE  Deveem SarvalOka- MahEswareem”  
KurEsar concludes this slOkam with the statement that the Lord of MahA Lak shmi is the Purushan celebrated by Purusha Sooktham as “Sahasra Seersha:”  KurEsar’s words are: “Sa: Sahasra-MoordhA Purusha: SaakshAth”  
Wherever one turns, SrivathsAngAcchAr Swamy identifies the Sruthi, Smruthi,  PurANa PramAnams behind each word chosen by KurEsar in the slOkams of  Sri VaikuNTha Sthavam to establish the supremacy of Sri VaikuNTha Naathan.

COMMENTS: 

This slOkam is a joint celebration of the Lord and the Purusha Sooktham eulo gizing Him. The five adjectives of the first two lines of this slOkam  
“Sarva Srutishu anugatam, sTiram, aprakamyam, NaarAyaNa aahvayadharam,  anavadhyam” qualify “asEsha Jagath pavithram”. These five visEshaNams  (qualifiers) are equally relevant to Purusha Sooktham: It is found in all the  four VedAs (Sarva sruthishu anugatham); it is firmly established (sTiram); it  is unassailable (aprakampyam); it has the name of NaarAyaNa  (PourushamEva SookthEna, tadh VishNOrithi manthrENa sookthEna Pu

MEANING: 

Oh Lord! Your auspicious guNams have been declared by the VedAs to be be yond mind and speech (avAngh-manasa avagAhyam) and that bliss arising  from the contemplation of these divine guNams increases in units of hundred  starting from the aanandham of humans. That bliss is unique to you and your  matchless guNams. In the Aananda valli passage, you are identified as the  indweller of the chEtanams. You also become the indweller of the Sooryan as  white lotus eyed Purushan.  

COMMENTS: 

Aanandhavalli passage from Taittireeya Upanishad starts with Maanusha an andham / human bliss (sa yEkO Maanusha aanandha:). 
That is taken as the unit for the measurement of the bliss of:  
1. Manushya- Gandharva  
2. Deva-GandharvAs  
3. Pithrus  
4. aajanaja dEva  
5. karma dEva  
6. Deva  
7. Indhra 
39  

8. Bruhaspathi and  
9. PrajApathi  
The bliss of each of the set of ten starting from Manushyan is 100 fold larger  and ends with the aanandham of Brahman as the loftiest (sa yEkO BrahmaNa  aanandha:).  
KurEsar draws the Upanishad PramANam on Aanandham to point out that the  loftiest of aanandham is enjoyed by the Parama Purushan as the Supreme Be ing. That He is inside all chEthanams as antharyAmi (indweller) and in  achEthanams as anupravEsam proves His SarvEswarathvam. He is inside the  orbit of the Sun (PoushNa: Purusha: Sa:) and has eyes resembling the lotus  (“tasya yaTA kapyAsam PuNDareekam yEvamakshiNeem”) KurEsar piles up  pramANam after pramANam to remind us of the ParadEvathA Tatthvam of Sri  VaikuNThanAThan here.

MEANING: 

MahOpanishad dealing with the creation of the universe states that the an cient kaaraNam (reason) for Srushti is described by the Vedic word, Sath or  Brahman or Aathmaa. That aadhi kaaraNam for the creation of this naama roopa prapancham has been identified further as none other than Sriman  NaarAyaNan. SubhAlOpanishad and other Upanishads follow the path laid out  by MahOpanishad.  

COMMENTS: 

In the previous slOkam, KurEsar stated that the Lord has the guNam of im measurable bliss and He is the One who grants MOkshAnandham to those who  perform SaraNAgathy to Him. In this slOkam, KurEsar salutes the Lord as Ja gath KaaraNan. VedAs salute this Jagath-KaaraNa Vasthu as “Brahman, Sath,  and AathmA”. That Sriman NaarAyaNan is the Jagath KaaraNan is pointed out  by the passages of MahOpanishad ("yEkO havai NaarayaNa aaseeth, na Brah maa nEsAna:”) and SubhAlOpanishad (dhivyO dEva yEkO NaarAyaNa:). Thus  all padhams speak about NaarAyaNan (Siva means auspicious) and therefore  NaarAyaNan alone is the Jagath KaaraNan.

The other  Sruthi (Kata valli) identifies that vasthu as the Supreme abode of all pervasive  VishNu.  

COMMENTS: 

Here, KurEsar refers to two Upanishads (NaarAyaNa anuvAkam and Kata Valli)  that salute VishNu as the Supreme Lord. In the previous slOkam, KurEsar re ferred to two other Upanishads (MahOpanishad and SubhAlOpanishad) in this  context.

MEANING: 

Oh Sri VaikuNTha NaaThaa! There are thousands of Upanishadic passages to  salute your status as ParamAthmaa. Your KaaruNyam and Sarva Rakshathvam  were well demonstrated in your avathArams. For instance, no differences  were found between a lowly worm and the grand Brahma Devan at the times  when You measured the worlds with three steps as Thrivikraman or when You  swallowed the worlds as a small child floating innocently on the bed of a  peepal leaf or when You released the world from Your stomach at the time of  creation. Such is your greatness in blessing one and all with Your compassion!  

COMMENTS: 

BhagavAn is abhinna nimitthOpAdhana KaaraNan (Moola Vasthu as well as Sa hakAran) for the world. This is His ParamAthma Tatthvam. His greatness and  dayA for all the created beings is revealed during ThrivikramAvathAram and  Vada Pathra sayanAvathAram. During Thrivikrama avathAram, His sacred feet  touched the heads of the mighty Brahma to the lowly worm and consecrated  all of them. During His Vada Pathra sayanam, He protected His created beings  
from insect to mighty BrahmA by holding them in a small portion of His stom ach and then releasing them at the end of the deluge. His sacred feet during  ThrivikramAvathAram have been loudly proclaimed by the VedAs like the  sound emanating from a gigantic drum (“Thrivikramasya Vijaya DiNDimAy itham vEdhai:”). VishNu Sooktham celebrates them as “SamooDam asya  paamsurE”

COMMENTS: 

Here, KurEsar gives the reasons for the intelligent people to arrive at his con clusion that BhagavAn alone is the Supreme Being. His Soumya/SubhAsraya  roopam (Roopa SrI) is unique among gods. The beauty and luster of His body/ dhivya MangaLa vigraham, His weapons, His aabharaNams, His hastha  Mudhrais are not matched by any other gods. Other gods have karma samb handham (Karma yOnaya:) and BhagavAn is totally untouched by karmAs. All  the others are “midikkilaa devar” (those without any Srimath Gaambheeryam)  as described by Thirumazhisai AzhwAr, compared to our Lord.

It is well known that the side-glances of Sri Devi are the root (fundamental)  cause for the ever-growing wealth of all gods. Because She (SrI Devi) has  joined You, She is known as “SrI”. The AchArya PurushAs like Swamy ALavan thAr and Thirumangai AzhwAr describe You therefore as “Thiruvukkum Thiru”,  the Lord of the Supremely auspicious SrI Devi.  

COMMENTS: 

The vaibhavam of Sri Devi and the impact of that Vaibhavam on BhagavAn is  alluded to in this slOkam. The pramANams about the glories of MahA Lakshmi  (Sri Devi) conferring Sriya: pathithvam to Her Lord as His lakshaNam

MEANING: 

Oh Lord, who is blemishless, firmly established, untouched by the dhOshams  arising from Karmaas, auspicious, unchanging unlike JaDa vasthus and stay ing as the undepletable mine of auspicious attributes! There are those with  distorted views declaring that you are the Jeevan that is born again and again  due to its Karmaas as tree, plant, creeper, worm, insect, birds, animals and  other janthus. Your avathArams are out of your own sankalpam (volition) and  are without any blemish and beyond the influence of any karmaas. Those deaf  kudhrushtis do not understand your true nature and state that You are indeed  the same as the Jeevan, which is distinctly karma vasyan. You are untouched  by Karmaas and their influence.  

COMMENTS: 

VedAs salute BhagavAn as “ajAyamAnO BahudhA vijAyathE”. His birth is not  like ours, which is controlled by our Karmaas. BhagavAn enters into all cre ated vasthus and makes them function. He does not undergo changes  (vikAram) in Svaroopam like achEtanams or changes in SvabhAvam like  Jeevan or influenced by the Karmaas (na Maam karmaNi limpanthi). There is  
none, who is equal or Superior to Him. BhagavAn is nithyan, nirmalan, Niran janan and nirvikAran (eternal, blemishless and changeless). He is defined by  the Ubhaya Lingams (Blemishless and KalyANa guNa PoorNan). This slOkam is  to answer the claims of Adhvaithis that the Supreme Being (Brahman) is Nir guNa Brahman without any attributes. BhagavAn’s incarnations are SuddhA-
49  
vathArams (free from thriguNams) and SvEcchAvatharams (happening out of  His own Sankalpam).

MEANING: 

All the chEtana - achEtana vasthus of the world await the glances from your  auspicious eyes to fall on them. If your glances do not fall on them, they can not even make a movement. For staying in existence, the objects of the world  depend on your rejuvenating glances. Therefore the VedAs declare you as the  World itself (sruthou tvam yEva Jagath jagadishE). 

COMMENTS: 

Vedam says that the acts of creation, protection and dissolution are the acts of  the Supreme Being: “Tadhikshitha bahu syAm prajAyEyRthi”. 
From this pramAnam, it becomes clear that the Lord’s KatAksham is the root  cause for the creation of the world and its beings. Swamy ALavanthAr elabo rated this Veda PramANam this way: “nAvEkshasE yadhi, tathO bhuvanAnya mUni nAlam PrabhO! bhavithumEva kutha: pravrutthi:” Oh Lord, if your  glances had not fallen on the world, how could they have originated and  stayed into existence?

MEANING: 

Oh Bhagavan with the six attributes of Jn~Anam, Sakthi, Balam, Iswaryam,  Veeryam and Tejas! The VedAs point out that all the sentient and insentient  ones have been given names and forms by you. You are indeed behind them  shining as Naama Roopa Prapancham. They are totally under your control.  This unique greatness of your glories makes the great sinners become filled  with jealousy and get deluded in the process (anAdhi pApavAsanAmushithaas 
Esha - sEmusheekANAm according to AchArya RaamAnuja).  

COMMENTS: 

There are many pramANams quoted by SrivathsAnkAcchAr Swamy about the  Lord creating the Naama-Roopa Prapancham (naamAni RoopANi vichithya  dheera:, nAmaroopE vyAkarOth, nAmaroopE VyAkaravANi). None of the others  are responsible for Jagath KaaraNam (na BrahmA nEsAna:). Vedam states:  “yEkO ha vai NaarAyaNa aaseeth”

MEANING: 

Those occupying high positions as Brahma and Siva attained their lofty offices  only though the small portion of your auspicious glances falling on them for a  fraction of a second. They climbed to a state not attained ever by chEtanams.  They are called even Iswarans as a result of the BhagavAn’s anupravEsam  that makes them an amsam of the Lord and they follow the path laid out by  BhagavAn to do their duties as the Creator (Brahma) and destroyer of the Uni 
verse (MahEswaran).  

COMMENTS: 

Oh BhagavAnn! You alone have limitless aiswaryam. When your glances fall on  one due to his Poorva Janma sukrutham, that soul is blessed to attain high  status as per Bhagavath GitA:  
Yadh yadh vibhUthimath satthvam SrimathUrjithamEva vaa

(Githai X: 41) 
About Brahma and Sivan attaining the status as Creator of the Universe and  destroyer of the same, BhagavAn Himself says: “MadhAdarsitha PanTAnou  srushti-samhAra kaarako”. They follow the path laid out by Him (Bhagavan)  and due to His anupravEsam (entry inside them) go about performing the du 
ties of creation and destruction of the universe.

In our VisishtAdhvaitha darsanam, we accept as eternal, Moola Prakruthi,  Jeevans and Nithya Sooris (eternally liberated chEtanams) through Veda Pra mANams. There are others, who out of delusion contend that Your Lordship is  limited in scope over these eternal entities (Iswaryams). Vedam on the other  hand asserts that your control over them is total, limitless and reaches out  everywhere.  

COMMENTS: 

Here, KurEsar criticizes the Yaadhava PrakAsa Matham, Saiva Matham and the  Matham that holds that the good and bad happen to one due to the power of  their karmAs and Bhagavan has no role in controlling them. KurEsar cites the  Veda PramANam of “Pathim ViswasyAthmEswaram” and therefore nothing in  His universe happens without His sankalpam and He is the Sattha of all pad 
hArTams/vasthus and they are all tied to Bhagavath Iccha.

MEANING: 

Oh Bhagavann! The existence (satthaa) of all vasthus (entities) is realized  only through your sankalpam. Among them, you select a few to stay eternal  such as ThriguNam, Kaalam, and Suddha Satthvam Nithya VibhUthi, Nithya  Sooris and Dhivya MangaLa Vigraham. The Jeevans are eternal (nithyam) in  Svaroopam but become non-eternal (changing/anithyam) by SvabhAvam.  Even the latter, who are nithyam in Svaroopam but anithyam in SvabhAvam,  are “Iswara SankalpAsritham” - take refuge in Iswaran’s sankalpam and gain  their Satthaa.  

COMMENTS: 

Here, KurEsar criticizes the VaisEshikAs, who accept Jn~Ana, Balaadhi sakthis  but refuse to accept His sankalpa sakthi and points out that all vasthus are  under the Lord’s total control through His sankalpam. This way, KurEsar es tablished Nithya VibhUthi for BhagavAn. The key pramANam here is “IcchAtha  yEva tava visva-padhArTa satthaa”.

MEANING: 

Oh Achyutha (One who does not let down those who sought protection slip  away from Him)! You are indeed the various reasons (KaaraNams) for all  (tvam visvasya visva-vidha kAraNam) All the sentient and insentient of this  universe are under your control. (Chidhachith svaroopam tadh yEthath  akhilam tava Kaaryam) You do not undergo any changes (tvam nirvikAra:).  This nirvikAra svaroopam and celebration of it in loud voice by the Upanishads  is a demonstration of Your Supreme Lordship over every thing in this universe  (tvam nirvikAra ithi vEda-sirassu ghOsha: tava yEva nissemam darsayathi).  

COMMENTS: 

This slOkam was constructed to refute the views of strict logicians, Paasu patha Matha anusAris and the followers of Bhaaskara Matham. They hold the  view that the Supreme Being undergoes VikArams (changes/Brahma svaroopa  pariNAmams). Vedam and their siras bhAgam, the Upanishads instruct us that  BhagavAn, the Sarva charAcharAthma is nirvikAran (changeless): “Nishkalam  nishkriyam Saantham niravadhyam niranjanam” The Upanishads state that  for the indwelling ParamAthmA, there are no changes. When a child becomes  adult, the changes (Kaaryathvam) are in the body and not in the Aathmaa.  
NimithOpAdhana kaaraNams are distinct from each other. When a pot is cre ated by a potter, the clay, the stick to shape it and the wheel to rotate the pot  in formation are needed to complete the construction of the pot. These are the  three kinds of kaaraNams: 
57  

1. The clay is known as the UpAdhAna KaaraNam.  
2. The stick and the wheeel (DhaNda-chakram) are known as the Sa hakAri KaaraNam.  
3. The man who makes the pot (the Potter/ Kuyavan) is recognized as  Nimittha KaaraNam.  
Moola Prakruthi out of which the world is made, the ChEthanAchEthanams and  the Lord who creates the world are different from one another. It is impossi ble therefore for the Lord (Nimitthan) to transform into UpAdhAnam and un dergo the vikArams such as pot as per this view. Therefore, we conclude that  NimitthOpadhAna KaaraNams are quite different from each other is the cor rect view as advocated by VisishtAdhvaitham.

MEANING: 

KurEsar poses a rhetorical question here:  
Oh SarvEswaraa! What phalans you have in mind when you create all these  chEtanams and achEtanams from Moola Prakruthi and what instruments do  you use? And where do you stay, while you engage in Jagath Srushti?  
The answer is of course that you do not anticipate any phalans for your leelai  of Srushti and yet people with distorted logic (Kutarkis) venture to attribute  all kinds of reasoning for your engagement in the creation of the world. Those  who are experts in the VedAs however understand that your glories and rea 
soning are beyond our ken.  

COMMENTS: 

BhagavAn is known as avAptha Samastha Kaamaan or one who has gained all  desires and is not in want of anything. There is nothing He has to do in all the  three worlds to gain phalans. Swamy ALavanthAr in Iswara Siddhi therfore  asks: AathmakAmasya Kaa Spruhaa? Where is the urge for one who has every  thing (Iswaryam) to seek more?  
He does not need any instruments to create all beings from Moola Prakruthi.  He is Sarva Sakthan. He does not stay at one place or seek any aadhAram to  stay put to create since He is again all-powerful. If He becomes upAdhAna  KaaraNam (Moola prakruthi), then He will have to undergo VikArams  (changes) and that is against the Vedic revelations. 
59  

The answer to the first question on what are the help/instruments that You  use to create is:  
He creates with the help of His KaaruNya GuNam and Sri Devi. He does not  need any limbs (accessories /saadhanams) to create the Universe and its be ings, since Upanishads state that He sees without eyes, He hears without ears  and he moves without legs and grabs without hands (pasyath achakshu:, sa  sruNOthy akarNa:, apaaNI-PaadhO javanO gruheethaa). This is Brahma Lak shaNam and He is established in His own vaibhavam (svE mahimna: pra thishtitha:)  
The answer to the next question on where He stays, while He creates is: 
He is SvAdhaaran or rooted in Himself and therefore, He does not need any  aadhAram to stay still to create. He can create without staying put in one par 
ticular location.  
sadagopan.org  
The answer to the third question on what is UpAdhAna vasthu for creation is: 
He has adhbhutha /Vichithra sakthi and uses His power of volition (nija  sankalpam) to create the universe out of Moola Prakruthi.  
The answer for the fourth question on what Phalan or PrayOjanam that he ex pects in Srushti vyApAram is: 
He creates the Universe and its beings, gives them senses, indhriyams,  Saasthrams to follow and hopes that they (the jeevans) will attain sadhgathi.  Brahma Soothram: “LOkavatthu leelA Kaivalyam” also answers this question.  Brahman Possesses special inherent power by means of which it can evolve  itself into the universe without affecting its svaroopam. Brahman enters into  the created objects (anupravEsam) along with the Jeevan to give them names  and forms (naama-roopa vyAkaraNa).

The BrahmANDam, the abode of Brahma dEvan, Haran, Indhran et al has  seven lower and seven upper lOkams surrounded by the seven tatthvams  (Earth/PruTvee, Water/Appu, tEjas, Vaayu, AakAsam, ahankAram and Ma

COMMENTS: 

The 14 worlds belonging to the BrahmANDam subject to the Srushti of Brahma  Devan are referred to here. There are other ANdams that are outside this  BrahmANDam, which BrahmA or Sivan et al do not know about. All of them to gether are serving as the Lord’s LeelA VibhUthi (Sportive Iswaryams). There  was a question in the 38th slOkam (Kasmai phalAya srujatheesa idham  samastham:) For what phalan do you create all these fourteen lOkams? The  
answer is given in this slOkam: “kreeDavidhEs-tava paricchadatAm agac chan”. These activities indeed are all for Your pleasurable sport is the answer.

Oh Lord! All the LeelA VibhUthi (the fourteen lOkams and the other anDams  created by You for Your sport are a speck of Your entire Iswaryam (Ubhaya  VibhUthi consisting of Leela and Nithya VibhUthis). Your Nithya VibhUthi (Sri  VaikuNTham) never undergoes any change. It is gigantic compared to the  LeelA VibhUthi (BrahmANDam) and has won over Kaalam (Time).  

COMMENTS: 

Arjuna experienced the vastness of the Nithya VibhUthi when he had the  bhAgyam of witnessing the Lord’s Viswaroopam. Sage ParAsarar explained  that the LeelA VibhUthi is like an atom compared to the Meru Mountain of  Nithya VibhUthi. The LeelA VibhUthi (BrahmANDam and other similar aN 
Dams) is a result of the KarmAs of Jeevan and came into being through Bha gavath Sankalpam. They change into sareeram and Indhriyam and undergo  changes. They are also subject to the power of Time (kaalam).  
Nithya VibhUthi on the other hand is not affected by Kaalam, Karmam and  other pariNAmams (changes). It is eternal (Nithyam). The entire assembly of  BrahmANDam and other aNDams of LeelA VibhUthi is one fourth in size com pared to the vastness of Nithya VibhUthi (PaadhOasya visvA bhUthAni thri pAdhasya amrutham dhivi). Nithya VibhUthi is immeasurable hence compared  to LeelA VibhUthi. The river Viraja forms the boundary between the two Vib hUthis. This Nithya VibhUthi is saluted in this SlOkam of VaikuNTa Sthavam by

In slOkam 45: “VaikuNTa-nAma tava dhAma tadhAmanan thi” (The ancients describe that the place named SriVaikuntam as Your perma nent abode). “tath VaikuNTa Naama tava dhAma aamananthi” is the anvaya  kramam (prose order).

MEANING: 

(The ancients describe the place named Sri VaikuNTham as Your permanent  abode) that is saluted as the Supreme abode of VishNu; it is the same Su preme abode of the Lord and is the ParamAkAsam beyond Tamas known oth erwise as Moola Prakruthi; it is the place which is full of lustre and is Suddha  Satthvamayam (free from any admixture of RajO or TamO guNams); it is eter nal, the basis of all bliss, the most beautiful and wondrous.  

COMMENTS: 

In the first Paadham of this slOkam, KurEsar salutes Sri Vaikuntam as  “VaishNavam Paramam Padam” along the lines saluted by the ancient VedAs:  “ tadh VishNO: Paramam Padham, VishNO: padhE paramE madhva uthsa:”  
In the second paadham, KurEsar salutes Sri Vaikuntam as ParamAkAsam (teLi  visumpu, sENuyar vaanam): “kham vaa yadhEva Paramam”. “Kham” means  aakAsam; “paramam kham” means “ParamAkAsam”, the Supreme aakAsam  beyond Moola Prakruthi. The PramANam is “kham vaa yadhEva Paramam 
64  

tamasa: parastAth”.  
The third paadham describes that VaishNava ParamAkAsam as  “tEjOmayam” (filled with radiance/lustre of aprAkrthic nature), Parama satthvamayam (free from admixture with rajO and tamO guNams), dhruvam  (eternal, firm, unassailable).  
The fourth and final paadham salutes that Parama Padham as “aanandha  kandham athisundaram adhbhutham” (the root of all aanandham, the most  beautiful and full of wonders) KurEsar’s selection of words in the third and the  fourth Paadhams are influenced by the vaakyams of Maha Rishis: “Yath sath  PurANam aakAsam sarvasmAth Paramam dhruvam, tadh vaa aakAsam  sanaatanam”. That VaikuNTha lOkam is beyond tamas (Moola Prakruthi) and  as such aprAkrutham is based on Veda Vaakyams: “Aadhithya VarNam tama 
sasthu paarE, tamasa parasthAth” The reference to “tEjOmayam” is again  based on additional Veda Vaakyams: “Param jyOthir- upasampadhya, na  sadagopan.org

(The ancients describe the place named Sri VaikuNTham as Your permanent  abode) That is unattainable even by Brahma Devan, Sivan, Indhran and Sana kAdhi Maharishis engaged always in travel by the Moksha Maargam; the visu alization of that land is equal to the enjoyment of the bliss on a par with the  Lord Himself; That land, which is the place of Your permanent residence has  no comparable lOkam in status equal or superior to it (SrI VaikuNTham) as a  place of worship.  

COMMENTS: 

There are three kinds of Jeevans: Karma BhAvanAs, Bhrama BhAvanAs and  Ubhaya BhAvanAs. Those who are born, die and are reborn due to their karma  Phalans are Karma BhAvanAs (Nithya SamsAris). Those immersed in seeking  the Moksha Maargam are Brahma BhAvanAs (Sages Sanaka, Sanandhana, and  SanathkumAraas). Those like Brahma, Rudhran who are also Karma VasyALs  but meditate on Brahman in between their assigned duties are Ubhaya BhAva 
nAs. Here KurEsar refers to Sri VaikuNTham beyond the reach of the three  kinds of BhAvanAs following the VishNu PurANa slOkam:  
yanna dEvA na munayO na chAham naapi Sankara: yanna dEvA na munayO na chAham naapi Sankara: 
jAnanthi ParamEsasya tadh VishNO: Param Padham 
There are four kinds of Moksham (SaalOkyam, Saaroopyam, Saameepyam and  Saayujyam). 
66  

The supreme most among them is Saayujya Moksham. Gaining the anubhavam  of bliss on a par with the Lord (Sama rasAnubhavam) and performing nithya  kaimkaryam to the Lord is the Supreme Moksham of Saayujyam. The other  three kinds of Moksham are subsumed in Saayujya Moksham. KurEsar refers  to this incomparable Saayujya roopa Moksham in the third paadham of this  slOkam: “Saayujyam ujjvalam usanthi”.  
Mere visualization of this Sri VaikuNTham by Muktha Jeevans and Nithya  Sooris (YadhAparOkshyam ujjvalam Saayujyam) unties all the binding knots  of the heart and destroys all the doubts and karmAs once and for all say the  U p a n i s h a d

The third Paadham of

MEANING: 

The Supreme abode of yours (Sri VaikuNTham) is free from changes based on  growth and dissolution (Vruddhyapakshaya vinAsa mukhai yEthai:  asamsthutham). This is the place, where the word “asthi” (present) never  ceases to exist (anasmith asthi sabdham).  
The fruits arising from the performance of the Yaaga Yaj~nams recommended  by the VedAs become insignificant compared to the fruits arising from resi dence in Sri VaikuNTham and end in sorrow instead of lasting bliss. That in deed is the glorious and eternal place of residence of yours saluted as SrI Vai kuNTham.  

COMMENTS: 

Here KurEsar instructs us that SrI VaikuNTham is not like the worlds, which  are born and which are dissolved. That VaikuNTha lOkam unlike PrAkrutha lO kams does not undergo the six changes: “JaayathE asthi vardhathE pariNA mathE apaksheeyathE vinasyathi”  
Unlike the transient words displaying the Shad (Six) bhAva VikArams  (changes), Sri VaikuNTham is eternal and changeless.  
The VaikuNTha lOkam is free from the seven blemishes that PrAkrutha lOkam  displays: 
69  

1. Limited aanandham  
2. Limited existence  
3. Ends up in sorrow  
4. Admixed with sorrow, when enjoyed  
5. Unfit for MukthAs sworn to perform Kaimkaryam to the Lord  6. Not easily created and  
7. Born out of viparItha abhimAnam.  
Therefore, Your SrI VaikuNTham is recognized as the AprAkrutha, Suddha  Sathtvamaya, dhruva Aanandhamaya ParamAkAsam.

They  instruct us that Your Supreme abode is attainable only by those who are Mu 
mukshus with no desire in future births and perform Bhakthi or Prapathti  yOgam to be blessed with Sri VaikuNTha Vaasam and Kaimkarya SaamrAjyam.  For all the others bereft of these qualifications, Your Supreme abode of Sri  VaikuNTham cannot even be thought of even by their minds. (bhUyishta bhak

COMMENTS: 

Para VaasudEvan resides in Sri VaikuNTham and is established in His own  glory (sva mahimnE prathishtitha:). His unparalleled glorious assemblies of  GuNams are recognized as existing expressly for Him (guNa gaNA: niyathA).  KurEsar chose the words “Samatheetha SeemA LakshmI: tava niyathA PriyA” 
based on the AzhwAr Paasura Vaakyam, “UnakkERkkum kOlamalarp-Paavai”  and AchArya RaamAnuja Vaakyam, “Bhagavan-NaarAyaNa apimathAnuroopa  Bhagavathee”.

MEANING: 

Oh Hari! The three guNams (Satthva, Rajas and Tamas) are far removed from  you. Therefore, the Rg, Yajus and the Saama Vedhams announce your nonpos session of these inauspicious guNams (nirguNathvam). You are the Lord of all  Iswaraas (i.e.), you are SarvEswaran. You are like the ocean for all these lim itless auspicious attributes to be housed.  

COMMENTS: 

This slOkam is to refute the views of Adhvaithins that Bhagavaan is NirguNan.  KurEesar states that the three guNams --associated with Moola Prakruti-- are  far removed from the Lord and therefore He is “NirguNan” and yet He is the  deep abode (ocean) of all kalyANa guNams (samastha KalyANa guNAmrutha  abdhi). The fourth paadham is based on Sruthi and UpabruhmaNams: “Ya:  Para: Sa MahEswara:” and “anAdhinidhanam VishNum SarvalOka mahEs

Oh Hari! You are the embodiment of Jn~Anam (Jn~Ana Svaroopi). Scholars  describe that Jn~Anam as a GuNam. One may wonder how that would be pos sible. He is both Jn~Ana Svaroopan and Jn~Ana GuNakan. His Jn~Anam is  asankuchitham (unshrinking) and does not undergo shrinking and expansion  like that of a Bhaddha Jeevan. He is both Jn~Ana Svaroopan and Jn~Ana  guNikan just as the gem full of lustre. With Your Omniscience, You cast your  glances on all the objects of the Universe. The protection for all these objects  arise from those glances of yours alone.  

COMMENTS: 

Here, KurEsar focuses on the doctrines of DharmabhUtha Jn~Anam and Dhar mee Jn~Anam. KurEsar distinguishes the Jn~Anam of the Lord from that of  Bhaddha Jeevans here. He celebrates the IeekshA-poorvika srushti (creation  based on His glances alone) and the Omniscience (Sarvaj~nathvam) that em powers such srushti (Sa Ieekshatha lOkAn nu srujaa ithi, tadhaikshatha Bahu  syAm prajAyEya ithi). This Sarvaj~nathvam is saluted in the third line of this  slOkam. The power of those glances of the Sarva Sakthan is celebrated in the  fourth paadham of this slOkam.

MEANING: 

Oh Bhagavann! When the VedAs attempted to measure (quantify) Your aan andham, which continued to grow from the assembly of GuNAs starting from  Your Youth, they (the VedAs) counted in units of hundred and proceeded in an  upward spiral from the human aanandham to the aanandham of Brahma  dEvan and gave up finally the count by concluding rightfully that there is no  
limit to Your aanandham. That aanandham of yours is declared as immeasur able and beyond count by the VedAs. They continue to grow (yEdhitham) like  Thrivikramans (vardhamAna:).  
  

COMMENTS: 

The aanandha svaroopam of Brahman was saluted earlier (24th slOkam) ac cording to the way shown by VedAs (AanandhO BrahmEthi VyajAnAth, Aan andhAdhyEva khalvimAni bhUthAni jaayanthE). KurEsar’s words in the 24th slOkam are:  
Aanandhamaiswaram avAngh-manasAvagAhyam 
aamnAsishu: sata-guNOttaritha-kramENa 
Here, KurEsar points out that, this Aanandham of the Lord can also be a  guNam as per the revelation of Aanandhavalli manthram (Aanandham Brah maNO vidhvAn). 
78  

BruhadhAraNyakOpanishad also celebrates BrahmAnandham-this Aanandham  growing hundreds of folds starting from human aanandham and growing be yond the gigantic aanandham of Brahma Devan (section 6.3).  
All the VedAs (trayee) give up their attempts to fully describe the aanandham  behind even one guNam like Youth (“Yuvath-mukhai: guNougai: yEdhitham  Aanandham iyAn ithi sanniyanthum asakthA:”)

COMMENTS: 

Here, KurEsar reminds us that the immeasurable magnitude of BhagavAn’s  aanandha guNam is not limited to just one GuNam like youth but it spreads to  all the auspicious attributes of the Lord. In Aanandavalli, Sruthi starts with  the guNam of youth (yuvaa syAth) and then continues with srEshta Jn~Anam,  Jagath SwAmithvam and other guNams and declares that the BrahmAnadham  associated with them are beyond descriptive power of the speech faculty.

MEANING: 

Oh Bhagavann! What a wonder! During the time of the great deluge  (PraLayam), You protect all the chEtanams staying like jada vasthus  (achEtanams) in a tiny portion of Your stomach since they are helpless due to  the shrunken state of their Jn~Anam. Once again, at the time of creation  (Srushti), You decide to look at the same instant at all of them (protected  jeevans) resting safely inside Your stomach and immediately the naama-roopa  prapancham in all its multi-faceted splendor springs forth. With that KatAk 
sham, this world from the lowly worm to the mighty Brahma Devan is created  by you without any partiality. You are guided in this act of creation only by  their karmaas.  

COMMENTS: 

KurEsar’s choices of words in his Sri Sookthis are always the distillation of es sence of Sruthis and the thoughts of his AchAryan’s SrI BhAshyam. This slO kam is an excellent illustration of that style (saili).  
BhagavAn has the six attributes starting from Jn~Anam (ShADguNya Poor Nan). Here, KurEsar pays tribute now to the first of the six GuNams (viz),  Jn~Anam.  
BhagavAn creates this universe out of Dayaa (KaruNai) and endows the  Jeevans with a body, indhriyams, Jn~Ana visthAram according to their  KarmAs (Karma anuguNam); further, he blesses them with His (Bhagavath) 
  
81    
  
  

Saasthrams to help them discriminate between the auspicious and the inaus picious. VedAs celebrate this compassionate act of creation by the Lord.  
During the time of PraLayam, the state of Jeevans is like the state of  AchEtanam without Jn~Anam. They get amalgamated with Bhagavan like the  water absorbed by the hot iron. Lord absorbs and protects these jeevans,  which do not have any naamam or roopam. They (Jeevans) could not be se 
perated from the Lord (abhEdham yEthath). SrivathsAngAcchAr Swamy quotes  a magnificent passage from Sri BhAshyam to illustrate KurEsar’s thoughts  here (Sri BhAshyam: 2.2.3):  
“Sa BhagavAn PurushOtthama: — leelA pravruttha:, yEthAni karmANi  sameecheenAni, yEthAni asamacheenAni ithi karma-dhvaitham samvidhAya,  tadhupAnOchitha- dEhEndhriyaadhikam tanniyamana sakthim cha sarvEshAm  kshEtra-jn~Anam saamAnyEna pradhisya — antharaathmatayaa anupravisya,  anumanthrutayaa cha niyacchan thishtathi”.  
sadagopan.org  
KurEsar’s 53rd slOkam is a marvelous summary of the Sri Brahma passage  which describes the Lord’s sousheelyam in line with Karmas  (KarmAnuguNam) and thereafter, anupravEsam and anumanthruthvam. The  Jeevan at the time of PraLayam was like a JaDa vasthu (aj~nam). Its Jn~Ana  sakthi was dull and shrunken (nirabhij~nam). Then, the Lord decided to cre 
ate the Naama-roopa prapancham consistent with the karmAs of the individ ual jeevans (YaTArham) and after srushti entered into them as antharyAmi  Brahman and directed them. He creates and empowers the Jeevans with sak thi according to their history of karmAs and does not evince any partiality or  preferences as per the Brahma Soothram’s revelation: “vaishamya nairgruNyE  na saapEkshathvAth”.

With the same sankal pam, You create the different species among Your creations ranging from  those which grow and those which shrink, as well as those, which reach an  auspicious state and the others which propel themselves into an inauspicious  state. All these polar opposites among your creations arise as a result of your  unimaginable power.  

COMMENTS: 

In the previous slOkam the Jn~Anam of the Lord was saluted. Here, one more  guNam of the Lord, Sakthi is celebrated. VedAs salute this adhbhutha sakthi:  “ParAsya Sakthi vividhaiva srUyathE”. He creates, enters into them and com mands them through that matchless sakthi. This universe consisting of multi farious wondrous entities are created with transformations and differentia tions with the power of that sankalpa sakthi (vichithram viswam avilakshaNa  veekshaNEna vikshOpayasi). KurEsar expresses his marvel over that Sakthi of  the Lord.

Oh Bhagavann! This world made up of sentient and insentient undergoes  changes in form (roopams) and modes (tanmai/PrakArams). You have the  power to transform them (Chetanams and achEtnams) into different forms or  to change them into different objects of creation or to make them nonexistent  (viparyasithum, anyath karthum, asath karthum cha KshAmyan). While you  are so powerful to bring forth any thing you wish, you rule them largely ac 
cording to their svaroopams and SvabhAvams. That restrained approach of  yours is very hard to understand (tvam SvabhAva niyamam Kim udheek shasE?). In this context, VedAs and the wise men state that the independence  unique to You (aiswaram SvAtantryam) is beyond al of our comprehension  and it is not possible to explain why you anticipate SvabhAva niyamam in  spite of Your SvAtantryam.  

COMMENTS: 

After paying tributes the two of the six guNams (Jn~Anam and Sakthi), KurE sar shifts his attention to the third of the six guNams of the Lord (i.e.),  Iswaryam. For the JaDa vasthus, svaroopa pariNaamam is siddham from  timeless times (anAdhi); similarly, for the Jeevans, SvabhAva PariNamam is  present (siddham) from time immemorial. This difference between the  achEtanam and ChEtanam is brought about by Bhagavath Sankalpam. In Sri  
BhAshyam, AchArya RaamAnuja 

comments 

on this difference: “Jn~Ana sankO cha vikAsa lakshaNO jeevasyAnyaTA bhAva: viyadhAdEsthu svaroopAnyaTaa  bhaava lakshaNa:” ChEtanam has Jn~Anam, which may shrink and expand. 
84    

AchEtanam is JaDa vasthu and has no Jn~Anam. This differentiation (Bhaava  lakshaNa vyavasthai) is attributed to Bhagavath Sankalpam. This is the “roopa  PrakAra pariNAma krutha vyavasthaa” referred to in this slOkam by KurEsar.  Lord uses it to create, transform and dissolve the chEtana-achEtanams of the  universe according to these rules (viswam viparyasithum, anyath karthum  asath karthum KshAmyan). Occasionally, BhagavAn chooses not play by these  standard rules and creates the basis for the unsettled discussion to classify  such nonstandard leelaas as either svaroopAnyathA bhAvam or SvabhAvAn 
yathA bhAvam. He transforms an achEtana vasthu in to chEtanam with  Jn~Anam. For example, the stone on the roadside got transformed into Muni  Pathni (Ahalyaa); the piece of charcoal got transformed into an infant  (Pareekshith Raajaa).

MEANING: 

BhagavAn’s tEjas is being saluted in this slOkam  
Your tEjas makes the Sooryan filled with bright rays look like night during  PraLaya kaalam. Your tEjas is never diminishing and pleasing to the mind and  causing fear to Your enemies. Ancients say such a fearsome tEjas of Yours  produces only auspiciousness to those dear to You.  

COMMENTS: 

The tEjas (lustre) of BhagavAn makes the brightness of Sooryan look like  darkness. The tEjas of the Lord outshines that of the Sun (Sahasra rasmE: us ram tamisrayath). This tEjas terrifies the enemies of the Lord and at the same  time protects His devotees. For those who are engaged in Bhaagavatha  apachAram, this tEjas produces terror and chases them down wherever they  are. For the devotees of the Lord, it has the most comforting effect. The power  of this tEjas makes the Stars, the Sun and all other luminary bodies shine  (tamEva bhAntham anubhAthi sarvam tasya bhAsA sarvam idham vibhAthi).

MEANING: 

Oh Bhagavann! It is very clear there is no bhOgam that you have not enjoyed  so far or any that you desire in future. This is well known. If your glances fall  on all the chEthanams, then they gain all auspiciousness. Aren’t you the One  in whom MahA Lakshmi has her abode? It is clear that all the wealth finds  their home in you and therefore I will not consider anyone other than you as  the most generous benefactor to shower us with riches. adiyEn will not seek  any body else for blessing me with wealth of every kind.  

COMMENTS: 

So far, BhagavAn’s six guNams (Jn~Anam, Balam, Sakthi, Iswaryam, tEjas et  al) were saluted to provide 
meaning for Bhagavath sabdham. Now, KurEsar  shifts to the celebration of His generosity (OudhAryam). His UdhArathvam  (VadhAnyathvam) is now saluted. All the other gods do not have the capabili 

ties to match the boon granting power of the Lord accompanied by MahA Lak shmi (“pENilum varam taraa midukilla Devar” according to one AzhwAr).  ThoNDardippodi AzhwAr gives us upadEsam on this matter and instructs us  about the folly of seeking other gods for boons, while the Lord riding on Garu dan is waiting to grant all that one seeks (kEtteerE NampimeerkAL Garuda  Vaahananaum niRka, sEttai tann madi ahatthuc-chelvam pArtthirikinReerAe).  
Our Lord is the one Supreme benefactor, who has the power and riches to  grant you any boon that you seek (“koLLak- kuRaivilan, vENDiRellAm taru,  kOthil VaLLal”). He never runs out of Iswaryam to bless us with.

MEANING: 

Oh Bhagavann! Your KaaruNyam is matchless and fills us with awe. ChEtanan  is immersed in the timeless SamsAra sAgaram and is about to drown buffeted  by the waves of sorrow, cycles of birth and death, old age and narakam. Out of  Your KaaruNya guNam, you take pity on such suffering Jeevans and decide to  bring them to the opposite shores of the fearsome ocean of SamsAram and in 
struct them on the PrAyascchitthams to destroy their paapams and save them.  
COMMENTS: 

From here on through seven slOkams, KurEsar engages in the celebration of  the incomparable KaaruNya GuNam of the Lord. KurEsar criticizes those, who  declare that BhagavAn is NirguNan (attributeless).  
Until now, KurEsar was engaged in eulogizing dhivyAthma guNams; now, he  shifts to the celebration of dhivya mangaLa vigraha guNams. Here, he starts  with KrupA-Vaathsalya-Kshamaa guNams, which assist the bhaktha janams  not to go away from Him. If there was no KrupA and KaaruNyam, bhakthAs  will be overwhelmed by His powers and will fear to approach Him. They will  reason: How great He is and how small I am (AmmAn AazhippirAn! Avan yev 
vidatthAn? yaann aar?), and run away from Him.  
To understand His KaaruNyam (Dayaa, KrupA), we have to visualize the five  wheels that swirl around us and catch us and propel us from one to other in a  ceaseless manner from ancient times. 
89  

These five wheels, where we get swirled around are: avidhyai, Karmaa,  Vaasanai, ruchi and Prakruthi sambhandham. AvidhyA (nescience) makes us  engage in KarmAs. Such engagement in KarmAs create residual effect  (vaasanai); that Vaasanai leads on to the taste (ruchi) to redo them. That  ruchi establishes the association with Prakruthi and we go through the cease 
less cycles of births and deaths. To break this awesome cycle, BhagavAn out  of His dayA (sahEthuka krupA) instructs us to practice Prapatthi as an excuse  (VyAjam) to gain His grace and be freed from Prakruthi. He is Omniscient  (Sarvaj~nan), Powerful Lord of the Universe (SarvEsan) and most merciful al 
ways (Sadhaa KaaruNeekan). Even with all that, He expects a request from  the Karma-bound jeevan to gain freedom from the terrors of SamsAric afflic tions (“Sarvajn~Oapi hi VisvEsa: sadhaa KaaruNeekOapi sann, SamsAra- tan thravAhithvAth rakshaapekshaam pratheekshathe”). The incomparable Ka ruNai of Mukundhan (apAra KaruNaa) and the deep vaathsalyam for His bhak thAs is saluted by Swamy Desikan following KurEsar later: “Mukundha Ka ruNAm vandhE MudhEshvadhika vathsalAm, svaroopasamsthavou yasyA: nir 
sadagopan.org  
hEthuka-sahEthukou”.  
Our performance of Prapatthi is a simple act compared to the mighty act of  response from the most merciful Lord. He grants us His unfailing protection  and MOksha phalan (kEvalam nu krupayaiva Samuddharishyan). AchArya  RaamAnuja defines the GuNam of DayA this way: “DayA hi naama SvArTa 
nirapEkshA, Para dukkha asahishNuthA” (One that does not think Of any gain  for himself but is incapable of watching others suffer). That is the nature of  the Lord’s DayA. He is avAptha samastha Kaaman (He is totally fulfilled and  does not need any thing from anyone); yet, his heart melts over the suffering  of the Karmaa-bound Jeevans and waits to rush to their rescue. When that  Jeevan sorrows over the mighty sins committed and how it can hope to over 
come their power, the most merciful Lord ordains PrAyascchitthams to destroy  all sins totally (“anupAdhuparamAth prAyasccchitthOnmukhathvatha:, tath pooraNAth chAparAdhA: sarvE nasyanthi paadhasa:”-- quote from aparAdha  ParihAra adhikAram of SrImath Rahasya Thraya Saaram). SaraNAgathy is the  remover of all Paapams (Sarva pApmAnaam sishDam hyAthmApahArasya  nishkruthi: SvabharArpaNam). PrAyschittha Prapatthi performed to destroy  any sins accumulated after Prapatthi takes care of their destructon. All of this  is made possible thru the KaaruNyam of the Lord.

MEANING: 

This slOkam also celebrates BhagavAn’s KaaruNya guNam.  
With Your ancient and eternal Vedams and Saasthrams, with the Smruthis  blessed by Sages Manu, Athri, Haareethar, with the happenings during Your  avathAra kaalams and with Your auspicious glances, You bless the people with  all mangaLams all the way up to Moksham. Your blessings are the waves of  Your Dayaa saagaram (Ocean of Mercy).  

COMMENTS: 

The Jn~Anam / Buddhi to discriminate the auspicious from the inauspicious is  provided by the Most Merciful Lord through His anaadhi Vedams, Smruthis  linked to Sage Manu and others, His katAksham. These are all Dayaa  Kaaryams for gaining the Phalans all the way upto Moksham (dadhAmi Bhud 
dhi yOgam tamm yEna YaamupAyAnthi tE). AvathAra Kaala charithrams are  enacted for the same purpose and arise out of His Dayaa to help the Jeevans.

MEANING: 

Oh Lord! You must explain the nature of this powerful and countless assembly  of Paapams that is pervasively present among the chEtanams. What a power  these pApams hold over those unfortunate ones, who do not practice the  UpAyam of SaraNAgathy revealed by you! It makes them (the non 
practitoners of SaraNAgathy) stay outside the domain of your incomparable  Dayaa.  

COMMENTS: 

In spite of the availability of our Lord’s KaaruNyam, some do not take advan tage of it. These are the unfortunates from birth (KaruvilE ThiruvilAthAr). The  timeless Paapams are the reasons that stand in the way between them and  the most merciful Lord. Bhaagavatha apachAram is one such Paapam that in terferes with the gaining of the Lord’s KaaruNyam. The ways to overcome this  handicap are described at length in the Utthara KruthyAdhikAram of SrImath  Rahasya Thraya Saaram.

MEANING: 

Oh Bhagavann! In this karma bhUmi, a jeevan accumulates in a fraction of a  second fierce paapams that cannot be destroyed even during the very long life  of Brahma dEvan. You bear with this chEtanam, who tirelessly accumulates  such Paapams in all his births by taking account only of the times in which  that jeevan does not engage in committing such paapams.  

COMMENTS: 

BrahmA’s day is made up of the combination of thousand chathur yugams.  Hundred days and nights of this length constitute the life of one Brahma  Devan. It is terrifying to visualize such gigantic time spans. In one fraction of  a second, the Jeevan commits mighty sins that will not be removed even dur 
ing the huge interval of time represented by the life of one Brahma dEvan.  Once that Jeevan practices Prapatthi and vows that it will not engage in Kar maas that will displease the ThiruvuLLam of the Lord, then the Most Merciful  Lord takes over and destroys these fierce and long-enduring Paapams and  grants the Jeevan His protection.

MEANING: 

Oh Bhagavann! How does Your great guNam of Forbearance (Patience) get  overtaken by those adorning the shield of anjali (folding the palms in a ges ture of reverence to You)? Thus, your intrinsic vaathsalyam (affection) for all  janthus -independent of the differences that they are good or bad-- does not  seem to make it (our Vaathsalya guNam) some thing unique for those, who  are deeply attached to You.  

COMMENTS: 

Here, Swamy KurEsar salutes the natural Vaathsalya guNam of “the Sarva Sa hishNu” VishNu. Swamy ALvanthAr peformed upadEsam for us about the ex traordinary power of our Anjali MudhrA: “Anjali ParamA MudhrA kshipram  DevaprasAdhini” (Anjali is a supremely powerful gesture that brings the  Lord’s anugraham swiftly). Anjali is an amsam of SaraNAgathy. Swamy Desi kan created later a Sri Sookthi named “Anjali Vaibhavam” to extol the great ness of Anjali MudhrA celebrated by Swamy AlavanthAr. For those wearing an jali as Kavacham, the anger of the Lord is held back. For those who are totally  devoted to the Lord, KurEsar says that it is not a surprise that BhagavAn’s  Vaathsalyam takes on the form of a guNam of the Lord.

As AzhwAr says: “yEzhai yEthalan Keezh 
mahan yennAthu irangi”. The Lord does not  
think that this one is a poor bloke or from a  
lowly background and makes even a Paapi  
transform into a Parisuddhan through His  
JaayamAna KatAksham. He does not look at  
the dhOshams of those, who seek His pro 
tection. He even treats these Paapis as  
equal in mahimai to His own intimate kaim 
karya Paran, Garudan.  
You treat everyone as GarudAzhvAn

MEANING: 

Be that (Souseelya guNam) as it may (tadh vai taTA asthu)! What of Your  svabhAvam that adiyEn is going to describe now (ayam SvabhAva: Katham?  Aho!)? That is astonishing. You mingle with Your Bhaktha Kotees with the  same attributes (guNams) that they choose to worship You by and You stay  under their adheenam (control) and mingle with those devotees at their  (same) level (tEna SamAna dharmA sann samslishyasi). 

COMMENTS: 

Now, KurEsar expands on the guNam of Souseelyam. He reminds us of the  Lord hiding His Svarupa-SvabhAvams so that the devotees do not get fright ened over their immensity and run away from him. Our Lord assumes there fore a simple manushya form during His avathArams (Raama, KrishNa  avathArams) and mingles with the devotees as one of them (Soulabhyam). He  says: “AathmAnam mAnusham manyE Raamam DasarathAthmajam”. Follow ing the Tathkrathu nyAyam explanation in Sri BhAshyam (4.3.14), BhagavAn  assumes the same guNams in Mukthi dasai (at Sri VaikuNTham for BhakthAs)  whatever that Bhakthan meditated upon during his stay on earth (before as cending to Parama Padham as a Mukthan). This does not mean that BhagavAn  has no other KalyANa guNams. It means that the overpowering Soulabhya Souseelya guNams of Sri VaikuNTha NaathAn makes Him display that guNam  chosen over the others by the devotee and leave the other guNams in the  background as per Tathkrathu nyAyam.

MEANING: 

Oh EmperumAn! Oh Lord of Parama Padham! Here at Sri VaikuNTham, You  shine as a gigantic blue mountain with the hue of collyrium (neela anjana  adhri nibham). You have a majestic nose (unnasam). You look with your beau tiful, big eyes (aayathAksham). Your hands extend all the way to your knees  (aajAnu jaithra bhujam). Your ears are beautiful and long (aayatha karNa  pasam).Your chest is adorned with the mole of SrIvathsam; the lakshaNam of  Parama Purushan. Your nabhi is deep. May we have your beautiful sEvai with  all these Dhivya MangaLa vigraha subha lakshaNams for many many years to  come (tvAm eedhrusam sarada: satham pasyEma:)!  

COMMENTS: 

This is a PallANDu singing for Parama Padha NaaTan. In the previous five slO kams, KurEsar enjoyed briefly the dhivya mangaLa vigraham of the Lord. In  the next ten slOkams, KurEsar salutes at length the dhivya soundharyam of  SrI VaikuNTha NaaTan.  
KurEsar reaches a state of mind (BhAvanA Prakarsham) of being in SrI Vai kuNTham and enjoying the beauty of the Lord there as His AchAryA (Sri  RaamAnujA) did at Srirangam on a Panguni Uttharam day and blessed us with  that vision via Sri VaikuNTha Gadhyam.  
At Sri VaikuNTham, BhagavAn gives His darsanam as Neela Megha SyAmaLan  (Chathurbhuja: SyAmaLAnga: SrI BhUmyAm saha NeeLayA). He is like Neela 
100JeemUtham (Neela JeemUtha sannibha:). He displays the MangaLa chihnam  (sign) of Sri Vathsam (LakshmI - vAllabhya SoubhAgya - chihnam Srivathsa:  asya Vakshasi). KurEsar concludes this slOkam with a Vedic Prayer: “pasyEma  saradha: satham”.

COMMENTS: 

Thirumangai AzhwAr’s celebration of the beauty of the Lord’s ThirumEni and  the avayavams are behind the inspiration for KurEsar in this slOkam:  “KaivaNNam thAmaraivaay kamalam pOlum KaNNiNayum aravindham  ahthE” (The palms and the fingers / Kai, the pair of eyes remind one of the  soft, red hue of the lotus).

MEANING: 

Oh VishNu Bhagavan! When are you going to give the five signals that convey  your benevolent intentions towards me? adiyEn is awaiting the indication of  those signals:  
1. The movement of your auspicious brows,  
2. Your beautiful and cool glances,  
3. Your bewitching smile,  
4. Your sweet words of welcome and  
5. Your thirumukha MaNDalam filled with affection for adiyEn.  

COMMENTS: 

Bharatha Naatya Saasthram states that one should express One’s thoughts by  five means: “Oshtaa-akshi-bhrU hastha paadhou vaachA mounEna so ochayEth” (lips, eyes, brow, hands, legs, speech and silence). Here, KurEsar  begs the Lord to reveal His auspicious intentions towards him with those sig nals. He asks: When are you going to bless adiyEn and when can I know about  that thru the signals emanating from the movements and expressions origi nating from Your limbs and faculty? KurEsar expresses his longing here for  signs of Bhagavath anugraham.

COMMENTS: 

BhagavAn is Mahaa Purushan and as such unique lakshaNams (marks) are  seen on the sole of His sacred feet. They indicate that Bhagavaa is Para  Tatthvam (Supreme principle) and is the SaamrAD (Emperor of the Uni verses). VishNu Sooktham reveals that delectable Honey flows from the sa cred feet of the Lord:  
“VishNO: padhE ParamE madhva uthsa:” 
Sounakar, Sukha Brahmam, Swamy ALavanthAr and Swamy Desikan have  made similar prayers for the placement of the Lord’s Thiruvadis with the  above subha lakshaNams on their heads. Sri Sukha Brahmam longed for such  a blessing this way: “sanchidhayEdh BhagathasccharaNAravindham va

MEANING: 

Oh VaikuNTha NaaTha! When will your lotus soft feet have its permanent rest  on adiyEn’s head as undiminishing wealth? Those sacred feet are the ones,  which through their steps showed the dimensions of the worlds and stay as  the matchless alankArams (decorations) for the heads of Your BhakthAs.  

COMMENTS: 

Lord’s sacred feet are the wealth that never diminishes or disappears (Nithya  dhanam). They are the superior decorations (noble SirOalankAram/utthamam  utthamsam) for the heads of visEsha BhakthAs of the Lord (anutthama bhak thi bhAjAm utthamsam). Those sacred feet are the Ones that measured the  three worlds during Thrivikrama avathAram (Thraivikrama krama krutha aak ramaNa thrilOkam, Paada Padmam). During ThrivikramAvathAram, the mark  of the Lord’s feet was left on all objects in the three worlds. They got sancti fied by that association. DevAs derived their sakthi from that imprint of the  Lord’s feet on their heads (Rg Vedam: athO dEvA avanthu nO yathO VishNur vichakramE). KurEsar longs for that sambhandham. In SrI VaikuNTham, the  abode of Muktha Jeevans is between the sacred feet of the Lord and the aad hAra Padhmam (lotus below the sacred feet of the Lord).

COMMENTS: 

Sri Saathvatha Samhithai states that SrI VaikuNTha NaaThan looks with affec tion at the Muktha Jeevans that reach His supreme abode, greets them with  His sweet welcome and places His hand on the siras of the jeevans as  anugraha mudhrai. KurEsar like others before him begs the Lord to prevent his  indhriyams from roaming here and there (Patti mEyAthu) by placing His aus picious hands over his head (AzhwAr’s request: “aNi mihu tAmaraik-kaiyai an thO! AdicchiyOm talaimisai Nee aNiyAyAi”).

MEANING: 

Oh VaikuNTha NaaTha! The natural beauty of your body without the associa tion of Your aabharaNams is itself astounding. That would be sufficient to sat isfy anyone. When the aabhAraNams are also added, that superior beauty  celebrated by AzhwArs and AchAryAs becomes multifold and makes one say,  enough, enough. This is indeed a matter of great wonder. This slOkam is link able to ThiruppANAzhwAr’s anubhavam of Lord RanganAtha (kOla MaamaNi  aaramum mutthu dhAmamum mudivillathOr yezhil neela mEni IyyO! niRai  koNDathenn nenjinayE!). Swamy Desikan would say later along these lines.  (“BhUshAyudhai: adhigatham nija kaanthi hEthO:”). Every limb of the Lord is  mangaLAnAm MangaLam. When the aabharaNams are added, then they get  enhanced in their beauty and add to the Lord’s Soundharyam.

COMMENTS: 

Sripathi Roopa DhyAnam along the lines described in SrI Poushkara Samhithai  is attempted here (sragvasthrAbaraNai: yuktham svAnuroopai: anUpamai:  chinmayai: svaprakAsaisccha anyOnya ruchiranjithai:). KurEsar wishes to en joy that dhivya soundharyam without blinking his eyes like dEvAs; sadhA  pasyanthi anubhavam is sought. NaayikA BhAvam is implied in this anubha vam (Bhuktham PriyAbhi: animEsha vilOchanAbhi:). There is no doubt about  the Svaroopam of the Lord, when one looks at the unique aabharaNams  adorning the Lord. For instance, the beautiful and tall crown adorning His  head is not seen on the heads of Brahmaa or Sivan. This crown is unique to  Him. Sivan has matted locks. Brahmaa has the appearance of Tapasvi  (Taapasa VEsham). Our Lord’s SarvEswarathvam is indicated by the Crown  
(Bhagavatasthu kiriDAdhi yOgAth SarvEswarathva khyApakam). He is under stood as “ImayOr Talaivan” through the adornment of this Vaira Mudi.

May adiyEn be blessed to live in the company of these dear parijanams and  AchAryAs of Yours forever!  

COMMENTS: 

In our darsanam, BhAgavatha sEshathvam (being the servants of BhAga vathAs) is more important than even serving the Lord (Bhagavath Kaim karyam). This slOkam was blessed to us by KurEsar to remind us of this  tatthvam. AzhwAr’s support for this tradition is seen in: “tala sayanatthu  uRaivARaik-koNDAdum nenjudayAr YengaL Kula dhaivamE”. Swamy Desikan  has elaborated on this topic in the PurushArTa-kAshtAdhikAram of SrImath  Rahasya Thraya Saaram. Even in the state of Mukthi (at Sri Vaikuntam),  Nithya Sooris, MukthAs and our PoorvAchAryAs stay as mutual servants of  each other in a state of Bhagavatha sEshathvam.

COMMENTS: 

We recognize all auspicious things in the universe as LakshmIkaram. When  her glance does not fall on them, they lose their Lakshmikaram. Sri BhAshya kArar celebrated her Mahimai as: “anavadhika mahimaa Mahishee”. She has  every Iswaryam that Her Lord has. She destroys all sins like Her Lord “vEri  MaaRAtha PoomEl iruppAL vinai theerkkumE”. The other quotations for her  incomparable mahimai are denoted by Her sacred names: “Vimukthi Phala  dhAyini, Sarva kaama pradhA, SamsArArNava taariNee, SarvArthi Samudhra  ParisOshinee”. Here, She is saluted as the grantor of Moksham, fulfiller of all  desires, One who gets us across the ocean of SamsAram and as the One who  dries up the ocean of all miseries.

Lakshmi (“ViNNavar amudhuNa,

COMMENTS: 

Swamy KurEsar has used three slOkams including this one to praise the Mahi mai of MahA Lakshmi as saluted earlier by Swamy ALavanthAr, AchArya  RaamAnuja SrI Sookthis, AzhwAr aruL vaakku and Sri VishNu PurANam. He  prayed for the bhAgyam of serving the Lord along with His divine consort, who  matches Him in every aspect (Tulya SeelA). KurEsar seems to indicate that  Kaimkaryam for PirAtti is his aim and PerumAL Kaimkaryam is incidental to  that Kaimkaryam to MahA Lakshmi. She blesses us with worldly Iswaryam,  
Moksham and residence in Sri VaikuNTham (Iswaryam akshara-gathim Pa ramam padham vaa). VEdam salutes the Divine consort of the Lord as:  “Iswareegum sarvabhUthAnAm asyEsaanaa JagathO VishNupathnee”. KurEsar  seems to suggest that his goal is Kaimkaryam to MahA Lakshmi and seems to  request Her dear Lord to be present at that time and accept his Kaimkaryams  as a dhivya MiTunam (Divine Couple).

Bhagavaan is saluted as “SrI BhUmi sahitham Hari:” Here, KurEsar expresses  his intense desire to perform kaimkaryam for the Lord in union with BhUmi  Devi. She carries the world of moving and stationary entities (sTira CharAth makam Viswam bibhrathi) and threfore is saluted as “ViswanmbharA”. She  has immeasurable patience (Kshamaa). She bears with all our aparAdhams  befitting her name, “Sarvam Sahaa”. She is the Mother of the world (“tvam  MaathA Sarva lOkAnAM PaadhanyAsam Kshamasva mE”: Sage Sounakar’s  words). KurEsar wishes to offer his homage to this dhivya Dampathis for the  removal of the deep dark night (KaaLa Raathri) of SamsAra bhandham. KurE sar prays for the anugraham of AruNOdhayam of Bhagavath Kaimkaryam in  
Sri VaikuNTham, where there are no nights (savcchandha Kaimkarya MahOth sava dhivasam).

May NeeLA DEvi of immeasurable generosity, who matches You in every as pect -- magnificent and auspicious thoughts, countless playful acts, the move ment of Her brows, sly glances and naturally blemish free smiles-- accept my  kaimkaryams!  

COMMENTS: 

In Vaikuntam, Parama Padha NaaThan is accompanied by His three devis (SrI,  BhUmi and NeeLA Devis). KurEsar offered his eulogies earlier to Sri DEvi in  three slOkams, BhU DEvi in the last slOkam and salutes NeeLA DEvi in this  slOkam. The presence of the Lord with His three dEvis has been saluted by  SamhithAs and AchAryAs. YathirAjar in Gadhya Thrayam visualizes this scene  at SrI VaikuNTam: “asankhyEya KalyANa guNaguna SrI Vallabha! YEvamb 
hUtha BhUmi-NeeLA Naayaka!”  
SrI Devi carries the red lotus in her hand; BhUmi Devi adorns red lily flower in  her hand; NeeLA Devi carries white lily in her hand. 
NeelA Devi is known therefore as “Alli Malar MahaL”. With Her dhivya sound haryam and love, She has the Lord under Her control, when it comes to Him  agreeing on forgiving the sins of ChEtanam and grants him Sathgathy. Her  power over Her Lord is saluted as “Alli Malar Mahal BhOga MayakkuhaL”. Ku-

COMMENTS: 

Lord has three Devis and shows equal affection towards every one of them.  His prEma Bhandham to them is of equal measure. KurEsar longs for a similar  level of affection from the Lord as one of “Sthree PrAyam”. He prays for the  soubhAgyam of pressing the Lord’s tender feet just as Mahaa Lakshmi and  BhUmi Devi do although he is unfit as a Mahaa Paapi: “VadiviNai illaa Malar  MahaL maRRa NilamahaL pidikkum melladiyai koduvinayEnum pidikka”

Oh Bhagavann! adiyEn is like a dead one. Strange indeed! adiyEn is a fool, who  is increasing his paapams more and more. adiyEn, who is despicable, should  be condemned for my lowliness. adiyEn has not spoken about your glories  even at the lip level. What a pity? How can a person of my neecha svabhAvam  and sins can even think about You, who is the abode of all auspicious guNams  and blemishless?  

COMMENTS: 

From here on with number of slOkams, KurEsar expresses his Naicchiyam  (statement of his lowliness) as he stands before the Lord in the spirit of the  AzhwArs: “NeesanEn niRaivonRumilEn”  
KurEsar and the AzhwArs do not have these neecha vrutthi (lowly ways); they  express themselves this way as an angam of SaraNAgathy (angam of Kaar paNyam)

COMMENTS: 

The expression of Naicchiyam continues in this slOkam. KurEsar refers to the  huge assembly of sins accumulated from many janmAs and asks the Lord a  question: When will it be that adiyEn with your anugraham get all these sins  destroyed and stand before you to perform Nithya Niravadhya Kaimkaryam to  You at Your Supreme abode?

MEANING: 

Oh Bhagavann! What does adiyEn know except the fact that there is nothing  superior to your sankalpam to rescue adiyEn based on the unalterable, ancient  and permanent relationship between us as Master and servant (SEshi sEshan). Here is nothing that is greater in auspiciousness to experience than  the fruits of Your sankalpam to accept adiyEn for Your nithya kaimkaryam.  

COMMENTS: 

Here, KurEsar focuses on KarpaNyam, one of the five angams of SaraNAgathy.  The state that generates the KaruNai (Mercy) of the Lord in us is KaarpaNyam.  PeriyAzhwAr declared in such a mood that he does not know anything about  the auspicious and inauspicious in this world and even if he knows about  those distinctions, it is not that either he could do anything about warding  them off (“Nanmai theemaikaL onRum nAnn aRiyEn, aRivEn aanAlumivai  yellAm yennAl adaippu neekoNNAthu”). This irremovable, inalienable, undis 
putable sambhandham (SEsha-sEshi relationship) and the avasara pradheek shai (Dayaa) propel the Lord to come to our rescue. Swamy Desikan followed  this thought and recorded it for us this way: “KarmasvanAdhi vishamEshu  samO DayALu: SvEnaiva kluptam upadEsam apEkshamANa: SvaprApthayE ta nubhruthAm thvarasE Mukundha! svaabhaavikam tava suhrutthvam idham  grunanthi”  
AzhwAr also reminds the Lord about this never- ending relationship with Him: 
  
122    
  
  

“viduvEnO yenn ViLakkai yenn aaviyai naduvE vanthuuyyakkoLhinRa Naatha nai”. In AchArya RaamAnujA’s Vaishamya-NairgruNya soothra BhAshyam, he  refers to EmperumAn responding to our adopting one of the two upAyams for  Moksham to be practiced by the chEtanams. Our Lord elects the ones, who ob serve the UpAyam of SaranAgathy or Bhakthi yOgam (priyatamO hi Vara NeeyO bhavathy, YasyAyAm nirathisaya priya: Sa yEvAsya priyatamO bha vathy according to BhAshyakArar). He responds to the ones, who adopt the  UpAyams (in gaining His anugraham, SaraNAgathy is the easiest and the best  to practice according to BhAshyakArar: “tasya cha vaseekaraNam taccharaNA gathyrEva”) KurEsar followed His AchArya UpadEsam and stated in this slO kam: “tvam yEnam janam urareekurushE chEth, amrutha: kascchith yuk thatama: na bhavathy yEva” (If You, my Master, choose this janthu, there is  no one to match this status as the best among Yogis).

COMMENTS: 

KurEsar states that those, who are not blessed to receive the moksham grant ing glances of the Lord (VishNO: katAksham) keep on accumulating Paapams  and go round and round the wheel of SamsAram without hope of redemption  (PaapamE seythu Paavi aanEn). How can we under those circumstances hope  to receive your anugraham asks KurEsar.

AdiyEn does not possess any sharp intellect to com prehend Your Saasthrams and upadEsams. adiyEn has not engaged in the wor ship of Your sacred feet. Therefore, adiyEn stands as the most fitting object  for Your karuNai (avasara Pradheeksha karuNaa).  

COMMENTS: 

Swamy NammAzhwAr’s Paasura Vaakyams (nORRa nOnbhilEn, NuNNaRivilEn)  and Swamy AlavanthAr’s SthOthra Rathna slOkam (na dharmanishtOsmi na  chAthmavEdhi na bhakthimAn tvaccharaNAravindhE, AkinchanOanyagathi:  SaraNya! tvath Paadhamoolam SaraNam prapadhyE) inspired Swamy KurEsar  to bless us with this slOkam. adiyEn is not adept at Karma or Jn~Ana or Bhak 
thi yOgams. adiyEn does not have the discipline to worship your lotus feet.  AdiyEn is destitute and deficient in all means. Your KaaruNyam and SahEthuka  dayaa alone can rescue adiyEn from these cruel samsAric sufferings. adiyEn  has no other gathi (annaya gathithvam is invoked here). adiyEn is therefore  seeking your protection (rakshaa) as a helpless one. Thou art the omniscient  and the most Merciful; yet you expect a plea for protection to save us from the  horrors of SamsAram: “Saravj~nOapi hi VisvEsa: sadhaa KaaruNikOapi, Sam

MEANING:  

Oh Bhagavann! What is the use of my 
meaningless utterances? adiyEn has ac cumulated paapams beyond counts hundreds and thousands of times over the  aeons consciously or without knowing. adiyEn is pulled under the weight of all  these big and small bundles of sins. adiyEn has no recourse except you. You  must forgive me and lift me out of my miseries out of your infinite and intrin sic guNam of Dayaa.  


COMMENTS: 

In the previous slOkam, KurEsar had the adhikAri svaroopam of aakinchanyam  (sense of meekness). In this slOkam, KurEsar states his ananyagathithvam  (not having any one as recourse to save him). He echoes Swamy ALavanthAr’s  moving plea: “AkinchanO-Anyagathi: SaraNya! tvath Paadhamoolam SaraNam  PrapadhyE”. KulasEkhara AzhwAr’s paasurams on VitthuvakkOttammAn (taru  thuyaram tadAyEl) dealing with ananyagathithvam also forms the basis for  this slOkam. It fits with our PoorvAchAryA’s prayer: “agathim SaraNAgatham  HarE krupayA kEvalamAthmasAth kuru”.

object of the merciful  
glances of AchArya  
RaamAnujA, who is  
the dearest among  
those having uninter 
rupted anugraham of  
Your lotus feet. The  
attachment to the  
Indhriya sukhams  
(PrAkrutha bhOgams)  
is tumbling me  
around in the fierce  
ocean of SamsAram.  
Where is the experi 
ence equivalent to  
the power of my  
karmAs? There are  none implies KurEsar  
KoorathAzhwar with AchArya RAmAnujar 
in his effort to describe the miserable state he is in. KurEsar suggests that  BhagavAn’s matchless power alone can free him from these samsAric miser ies. Here KurEsar invokes that sambhandham of AchArya RaamAnujA, who  considered every worldly anubhavam as thruNam (an insignificant speck of  
127  
dust) out of his love for the lotus feet of Achyuthan (yO nithyam achyutha  padAmbhuja yugmarugma vyAmOhathas-thatidharANI thruNAya mEnE).  AchArya RaamAnuja corrected those who are deeply attached to Vishaya  anubhavams like URangA villi Daasar. As Swamy Desikan observed, AchArya  RAmAnujA's sishyAs are not affected by PrAkrutha bhOgams: “Madhana kad hanai: na klisyanthE Yatheeswara Samsrayaa:” In this context, KurEsar thinks  about Raamanuja KaruNA and the power of EmperumAn in banishing the Paa pams resulting from Vishaya sukhams and echoes AzhwAr’s words: “aavi ti haikka Iyvar kumaikkum siRRinbham paaviyEnai pala Nee kAttippadup pAyO?”

MEANING: 

adiyEn roams around in this world after tens of thousands of births in differ ent wombs ranging in size from tiny to mighty animals, birds, humans and  plants; while residing in these wombs during garbha Vaasam, adiyEn reflects  with sorrow in that cramped space about the current and future births result ing from adiyEn’s karmAs. Not discerning any hope for change in the deplor able situation of repeated cycles of births and deaths, adiyEn roams around  ceaselessly in the prakruthi MaNdalam.  

COMMENTS: 

From this slOkam to the next 5 slOkams, KurEsar describes the terrors of  Prakruthi Bhandham (SamsAric shackles) resulting from one’s karmaas.  
GarbhOpanishad, VishNu PurANam (6th amsam, 5th adhyAyam), SusruthAdhi  samhithAs, JyOthisha Saasthram describe the memories recalled by the  Jeevan during garbha Vaasam (residence in the womb): the bad karmAs per formed during the previous births, the births taken and the future births to be  taken. The Jeevan resides in small wombs (KshOdhIyasa:) or in big wombs  (athi Mahathi); it is positioned in a highly compressed place (nirbhara  nipeeDana garbhEshu). The body is sorrow stricken (Khinna dEha:) as the  
Jeevan reflects on its sad lot due to its history of karmAs and its conse quences. It thinks about its tens of thousands of births taken up to this point  (JanmAntharANi para sahasrANi anuvichinthya). The jeevan is despondent  over not seeing any hopeful prospects for escape from the cycles of births and 
129  
deaths due to its load of KarmAs and feels the pressures of roaming in this  samsaric world endlessly.

Reentering the world from the mother’s womb, adiyEn experi ences and endures indescribable sufferings. adiyEn, who does not know of  anything but sufferings continue to engage in acts (KarmAs) that will yield as  phalan only additional suffering in the subsequent births too because of my  foolishness!  

COMMENTS: 

Seven kinds of dhOshams (blemishes) are attached to PrAkrutha bhOgams  (worldly pleasures) enjoyed by the Jeevan that make the Jeevan get wound  up even more tightly in SamsAram. Swamy Desikan describes them in a slO kam of SaraNAgathy DhIpikai (56th SlOkam). They interfere with the enjoy ment of BhagavAn and Bhagavath-BhAgavatha Kaimkaryams. These bhOgams  are insignificant compared to the ParipoorNa BrahmAnandham.They are per ishable, sorrow producing as one enjoys them and sorrow yielding after the  enjoyment. When the jeevan is inside the womb, it has the power to know  about its previous and future births (Jaathi smarathvam). When the wind  (SaTha Vaayu) touches the newborn child, it becomes a Jatam and forgets  about all of its previous lives. Swamy NammAzhwAr chased away that SaTha  Vaayu with a hoomkAra, as a result of the blessings of the Dhivya dampathis  and VishvaksEnar as he lay in the womb and came to be known as SaTha kOpan. KurEsar suggests that it is impossible for chEtanams like us to gain  that type of anugraham.

COMMENTS: 

KurEsar is performing upadEsam for us through his NaicchAnusandhAnam.  When KurEsar states that he is immersed in the enjoyment of Vishaya  bhOgams, it is to be considered as the limit of Viraktha Jeevan’s naicchA nusandhAnam. Swamy ALavanthAr described himself in this context as  “amaryAdha: kshudhra:” Thirumangai AzhwAr described his sufferings in the  
famous Paasuram: “VaadinEn Vaadi VarunthinEn”. Sounaka Maharishi de scribed his state, where the body is ailing from vyAdhis and the mind is run ning after vishaya sukhams (Sareeram mama DevEsa! VyAdhibhi:  paripeeDitham, manO mE PuNDareekAksha vishayAnEva dhAvathy).

KatOpanishad compares the Indhriyams to wild horses that take the jeevan  across rough terrain: “IndhriyANi hayAnAhu: vishayAn tEshu gOcharAn”. They  drag one thru pathless tracks. The arrogance arising from thinking that one  has excellent vidhyA ends up in VidhyA Madham. Wealth creates dhana Mad 
ham (madness caused by wealth). Birth in a noble kulam generates abhijana  madham. Together, these three madnesses are known as  “MukkuRumbhu” (three kinds of madness). KurEsar known for his superior  aathma guNams and VairAgya-anushtAnams never suffered from these mad 
ness or aasura svabhAvams. KurEsar expresses his NaicchAnusandhAnam for  correcting people like us.

MEANING: 

Oh Bhagavann! The intense desire for both easily attainable and the difficult to-attain things never subsides. It grows thousand fold even after attaining  them to gain additional similar things. Even if the wished -- for things are de stroyed due to interferences, the intense longing for such vishaya sukhams  grows and grows uncontrollably. This thrushNai (desire and thirst for Vishaya  bhOgam) stays as VardhishNu (ever growing) and is never quenched (na  saamyathi) laments KurEsar.

Oh Bhagavann! What a pity? adiyEn is not engaged in reciting Your auspicious  naamAs, eulogizing Your kalyANa guNams, prostrating before You and per forming AarAdhanam for You or meditating on Your dhivya mangaLa vigra ham. adiyEn has no ruchi or bhakthi for such noble acts. adiyEn has neither  the desire nor sakthi to be engaged in such efforts. adiyEn does not even have  the feeling of repentance over not being engaged in such activities. Is there  anything left among SaadhanAs that are opposed to your auspicious mind set  (ThiruvuLLam)?  

COMMENTS: 

When one performs SaraNAgathy to the Lord, the two angams of that Prapat thi (aanukoolya sankalpam and PrAthikoolya varjanam) has to be accom plished very well. Here KurEsar has nirvEdham (sorrow) over his imperfec tions in his observance of PrAthikoolya Varjanam. The prayer behind this sor rowful statement is that housed in VishNu PurANam (5.7.70), where KaaLiyan  
(Naaga rAjan) prays to Lord KrishNa this way: “sOham tE DevadEvEsa nAr chanAdhou sthuthou na cha, saamarTyavAn, krupAmAthra manOvrutthi:  praseedha mE”  
KurEsar feels dejected that even repentance (anutApam) over the omissions  does not arise in his mind. The purpose behind this type of statement of unfit ness (naicchAnusandhAnam) is to get rid of such prAthikoolyams and develop  gradually the qualifications for performing SaraNAgathy at the Lord’s sacred

MEANING: 

Oh Lord of all! What a pity? adiyEn is not touched even by an iota by the nec tarine and all pervasive breezes arising from Your Ocean of KaruNaa. adiyEn  does not comprehend how this misfortune (dhurbhAgyam) resulted. adiyEn  wallows in this state of helplessness, and is unable to find a remedy to reverse  this misfortune. adiyEn’s sorrowful status is clearly understood by me.  

COMMENTS: 

There are four ways to destroy the sins through prAyascchittham: “AnutApa,  Uparama, PrAchitthOnmukhathva and PrAyaschittha PoorNangaL”. In the  previous slOkam, KurEsar said that he has no anutApam; in the slOkam before  the previous slOkam (the 95th slOkam), KurEsar pointed out that there is no  uparati for him and his sins keep on growing. In this slOkam, KurEsar de 
spairs over his inability and lack of incentive (motivation) to perform the ade quate PrAyascchitthams to destroy his paapams. He hints that there is no  hope for him since the paapams are so heinous and limitless (apAram) that he  has reason to despair. Swamy Desikan voiced such feelings in Dayaa  Sathakam: “prasamayithum asEsham nishkriyAbhir-na sakyam”. He expresses  his dhurbhAgyam (lucklessness) about the ever-present breeze of the Lord’s  infinite mercy missing to touch him.

MEANING: 

Oh Lord of Nithya and Leelaa VibhUthis! Your Lordship, Your freedom from  changes in spite of your supporting every thing through Your indwellership in  all of Your creations, Your compassion to remove the miseries of the suffering  souls, Your omnipotence, Your Forbearance and particularly your guNam of  blessing others with soubhAgyams without expecting any thing in return are  well celebrated. Those auspicious guNams have found their ideal target in adi 
yEn, who is the abode of limitless and fearsome sins, which gives me the  status of a goner.  

COMMENTS:  

In the earlier slOkams, KurEsar saluted the anantha KalyANa GuNams of the  Lord correcting the erring jeevans out of His dayaa and bringing them to His  fold. Here, KurEsar states that all those guNams celebrated by VEdams and  Upanishads must be used in his favor. He points out that they cannot afford to  miss him as the most eligible target by the principle of “Reductio ad absur 
dum” (elimination process). They will be otherwise purposeless. Thus KurEsar  hints that he has the anugraham of SrI VaikuNTha NaaThan.  
For the Nithya sooris or the Muktha Jeevans, there is not much need for the  GuNams like KaaruNyam (Dayaa). For sages like Sanaka, who possess Sva roopa Jn~Anam, these guNams are not much in need either. These guNams  are only for the benefit of those who are helpless and lost in SamsAram.  Swamy Desikan says in this context: “manyE MaathA JaDa iva SuthE vathsalA 
138  
maadhrusE tvam”. Swamy ALavanthAr observed: adiyEn is the fitting object of  Your Dayaa (idhAneem anutthamam PAthramidham DayAyA:). KurEsar con structed the second Paadham of this slOkam (SwAmin! akAraNa suhruth tvam  aTO visEshAth) to remind us of the message of Upanishad that Sriman NaarA yaNan is the path and goal for us through SaraNAgathy (nivAsa SaraNam  suhrudh gathi: NaarAyaNa:). GeethAchAryan reminded us of this central doc trine: “suhrudham sarva bhUthAnAm jn~AthvA mAmm sAnthimrucchathi”.  Know me as the well-disposed One to all janthus and there from attain Peace  of mind says the Lord to Arjuna.

MEANING: 

Oh Bhagavann! It is well known that  
you rush to protect those who prac 
tice Bhakthi or Prapatthi yOgam to  
attain your sacred feet and also  
those who are fit to observe one of  
these yOgams. That is not an act of  
generosity by you. It is almost natu 
ral and some thing to be expected of  
You. That is KarmAnuguNa phala 
pradhAnam since they follow the  
path laid out by Your Saasthrams. It  
follows the rule:"kruthE cha prathi 
k a r t h a v y am y E s h a d h a rm a :  
sanaathana:” Your action towards  
me without any recourse or inability  
to follow the difficult yogams of  
Karma, Jn~Ana and Bhakthi has to  
be different. It will not be a great  
testament to your anugraha sakthi if  
you do not come to adiyEn’s rescue  
during my state of helplessness. adi 
yEn is “Dhee-karma-bhakthi rahitha  
asakthan”. KurEsar’s son (ParAsara  
KUram ThAyAr 
140Bhattar) commented on this aspect of the Lord coming to the rescue of the  asakthars and becoming fulfilled through such an act. Bhattar described in his  Sri RangarAja Sthavam that such an act of the Lord is like having a water stand in the middle of a desert instead of having such a stand in a place abun dant with water. Saving those, who are competent in Jan~Ana, Bhakthi  yogams is like adding water to a fish that is constantly in the middle of water.  Helping those fish struggling outside water, by placing them inside the water  is the example of the Lord helping asakthars,said ParAsara Bhattar. Thus Ku rEsar expressed his aakinchanyam (meekness) and ananyagathithvam (being  without recourse).

MEANING: 

Oh Lord! The adhikAram (fitness and qualifications) for practicing Bhakthi or  Jn~Ana or Karma yogam cannot be realized unless You will it so (athuvum  avanathu innaruLE). It is impossible for them to succeed by themselves in  such efforts. The Lord, who is SiddhOpAyan blesses them with the fruits of  such efforts. As for adiyEn, SaraNAgathy at Your sacred feet for some one  with my limitations in intellect and anushtAnam is the way shown by the  AzhwArs (nORRa nOnbilEn, nuNNaRivilEn aahilum ini unnai vittonRum aaRRa 
hiRkkinRilEn aravinaNai ammANE). adiyEn has dared to observe SaraNAgathy  at Your holy feet. The SaasthrArTam of the impossibility of SaadhyOpAyams  like Bhakthi Yogam giving the Phalan of Moksham without the prasadhanam  (favor) of the SiddhOpAyan (BhagavAn) is indicated here. KurEsar states that  he is therefore clinging to the upAyam of Prapatthi alone.

MEANING: 

Oh boon granting Lord (Varadha)! Thou art known to protect those, who ap proach you by the ways that you have created in Your SaasthrAs. If there are  any restrictions that you have about protecting the others outside the above  group, in that case, please bless me with the sakthi to practice the required  upAyam, fitness and the freedom from seeking the fruits of such an obser vance. Please bless adiyEn with all those required angams for reaching you as  UpEyam.  

COMMENTS: 

At the end of this Sthavam, KurEsar declares without ambiguity that the Lord  does not grant MOksham without Svanishtai or AchArya or Ukthi or BhAga vatha Nishtai. BhagavAn expects vyAjamAthra SaraNAgathy (rakshaapEkshAm  pratheekshathE). This is the essence of the Lord’s upadEsam: “MaamEkam  SaraNam vraja”.  
Following the way shown by the AzhwAr, KurEsar appeals for the Lord’s dayaa  to fulfill without deficiency all the angams of SaraNAgathy including the com pletion of the Utthara kruthyams to realize nithya, niravadhya kaimkaryams at  Parama Padham.  
KurEsar addresses Lord VaradarAjan, his ishta dhaivam in the last slOkam of  Sri VaikuNTa Sthavam: “Varadha! tvam yEva Mayi Sakthi, adhikAra vaanchaa,  prathyUha Saanthim, itharath viswAm cha vidEhi”. Kuresar did not ask 
  
  

  
  

“dEhi” (please grant me); instead, KurEsar selects the word “vidEhi” (please  generate in me). KurEsar seeks the anugraham of Sakthi, desire for fitness to  practice the upAyam and removal of those obstacles that stand in the way of  successful practice of the angams of the SaraNAgathy yOgam. With MahA  Viswaasam in Lord Deva Raajan of Kaanchi, Kuresar concludes Sri VaikuNTha  Stavam in the most hopeful, optimistic and triumphant note.

This Taniyan is about KurEsar and the SrI Sookthi of Sri VaikuNTha Stavam  blessed to us by him. In this Sri Sookthi, the Vaibhavams of Sri VaikuNTha  NaaThan are housed in Veda-VedAnthams. He celebrates His VaikuNTha Raa jadhAni, where He reigns supreme as the Emperor surrounded by Nithya  
Sooris and Muktha jeevans enjoying ParipoorNa BrahmAnadham and perform ing nithya, abhimatha Kaimkaryams for Him. In this Sri Sookthi, KurEsar sa lutes the UpAyams for attaining Him and eulogizes His DhivyAthma Sva roopam, Dhivya Mangala Vigraham, His three divine consorts (SrI, BhUmi and  
NeeLA DEvis), His anantha kalyANa guNams, His dhivya aabharaNams and Aa yudhams. KurEsar expressed movingly His Naicchiyam. He prayed through this  Sthavam for the well being of his own sishyan, NaalUrAnun, who had commit ted unpardonable apachAram against him. KurEsar had the ideal lakshaNams  of a MahA Desikan and forgave that MahAparAdhi, who committed AchArya  drOham.  
KurEsar also had the ideal sishya lakshaNam and demonstrated it in every  step of his way to his own AchAryan, SrI Bhagavath RaamAnujar. He gave his  own eyes to keep AchArya RaamAnuja out of the danger posed by the evil  ChOLA king.  
The attributes of the MahA Desikan celebrated in this Taniyan are:  Nigama sirasAm antha: nigooDam arTam vyakthee kurvan
