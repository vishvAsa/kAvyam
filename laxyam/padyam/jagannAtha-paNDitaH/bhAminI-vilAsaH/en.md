**INTRODUCTION**

 While paying a warm tribute, on one occasion, to thelate Lord Oxford (formerly Mr. Asquith) for his classicalknowledge and scholarship, Mr. Baldwin declared that hewas the last of the Romans—“the last of those whose debtwas to Athens and whose inspiration from Rome.”Itmay likewise be said of Pandit Jagannātha that he wasthe last of the “Romans,”for, the tradition of ClassicalSanskrit poetry which started practically with Kālidāsa,and which flourished through the vicissitudes ofseventeen centuries, found its last exponent of note inPandit Jagannātha. This observation is not of courseintended to convey the impression that the tradition of Classical Sanskrit Poetry has ceased to exist altogether.Far from it. The fact is that while, on the one hand, itcannot be denied that eminent Pandits have proved themselves heirs to the tradition which Jagannātha followedin his day, it has, on the other hand, to be admitted thatno successor of Jagannātha has attained to a statureas great as his own; and, besides as time rolls on,thetradition is certain to be influenced and proportionatelymodified by foreign modes and currents of thought andexpression. Jagannātha, therefore, may well be lookedupon as practically the last representative of the traditionof Classical Sanskrit Poetry.

**HIS DATE.**

 The darkness hanging over Indian literary chronologyhas become proverbial. Though the assertion of Macdonellthat the Indian mind was lacking in the historical senseis to be treated as an exaggeration, yet it is not altogetherunfounded. About a great many of Sanskrit writers weknow next to nothing. In not a few cases, the dates can

approximately be proposed only in terms of centuries:and even so the dates proposed by different scholars differby centuries! Kālidāsa, according to some, might haveflourished in the First Century B. C., while, according toothers, he must have lived in the 4th Century A. D.Kauṭilya might be assigned either to the 4th century B. C.or the 3rd century A. D.; and so on. For such a sad stateof affairs, the writers themselves are indeed responsible.This aversion to autobiographical references on the part ofearlier writers like Kālidāsa seems to have been theresult of their natural or—what is more likely—conventional reticence. The task of settling theirchronology therefore becomes proportionately difficult.

 It seems however that the tradition in this respectunderwent a wholesome change, for the later Sanskritauthors do not show the aversion which their predecessorsdid. This modification has taken place early enough, forwe find Bāṇa making detailed personal references in his**हर्षचरित**; and also, to a certain extent, in **कादम्बरी**; and Bāṇamight well have been, as Mr. Kane suggests, the first tobring about this wholesome change. Similarly, ŚrīHarsa, the author of the *Naiṣadhīya,* who lived about theclose of the 12th century A. D., gives a tolerably goodaccount of himself and his works in the concluding stanzaof each Canto of his renowned Kāvya. This conventionof making personal references attained greater and greatervogue, as can only be expected; yet, with all this changeit is not possible to arrive at precise dates about the birth,death etc. even in the case of later writers from whateverinformation they have left about themselves in theirworks.

 Fortunately, Jagannātha has been rather unstintingin making personal references. In a verse in the Śānta-

vilāsa. (45) he complacently says that during his youthhe enjoyed the splendid patronage of the Lord of Delhi:**दिल्लीवल्लभपाणिपल्लवतले नीतं नवीनं वयः**। Again, to the munificence of the Emperor he pays a warm tribute in thestanza :

**दिल्लीश्वरो वा जगदीश्वरो वा मनोरथान् पूरयितुं समर्थः।  
अन्यैर्नृपालैः परिदीयमानं शाकाय वा स्याल्लवणाय वा स्यात्॥**

 Now, regarding the identity of this Lord of Delhi, there is a popular belief that it was Akbar who offered patronage tothe Pandit, and therefore Jagannātha was a contemporaryof Akbar. On what evidence this popular view rests it isnot possible to ascertain. But, whatever that evidence, itis clear that it must be dismissed as unreliable becauseit would conflict with the internal evidence furnishedby Jagannātha's works, which unmistakably showsthat the Pandit flourished during the reigns ofthe Moghul Emperors Jehangir and Shah Jehan,particularly the latter. In the verse **श्यामं यज्ञोपवीतं**[^1]etc. Jagannātha mentions **नुरुद्दीन** which is areference to the Emperor Jehangir. And the highlylaudatory manner in which Jagannātha refers toJehangir suggests that the Pandit must have enjoyedthe latter’s patronage. The Emperor Shah Jehanis literally mentioned by Jagannātha as his patron.Shah Jehan seems to have been so much pleased

with this court Pandit that he bestowed onhim, as Jagannātha himselfavers, the title of**पण्डितराज.** ‘अथ सकललोकविस्तारविस्तारितमहोपकारपरम्पराधीनमानसेन प्रतिदिनमुद्यदनवद्यगद्यपद्याद्यनेकविद्याविद्योतितान्तः-करणैः कविभिरुपास्यमानेन कृतयुगीकृतकनिकालेन कुमतितृणजालसमाच्छादितवेदवनमार्गविलोकनाय समुद्दीपितसुतर्क-दहनज्वालाजालेन मूर्तिमतेव **नव्वावासफरवानमनः** प्रसादेन द्विजकुरुसेवाहेवाकिवाङ्मनः कायेन माथुरकुलसमुद्रेन्दुना रायमुकुन्देनादिष्टेन **सार्वभौमश्रीशाहजहांप्रसादादधिगतपण्डितराजपदवीविराजितेन** तैलङ्गकुलावतंसेन पण्डित-जगन्नाथेनासफविलासाख्येयमाख्यायिका निरमीयत। सेयमनुग्रहेण सहृदयानामनुदिनमुल्लासिता भवतात्।’–आसफविलास (Opening sentencesas quoted in the Introduction to the N. S. Editionof **रसगङ्गाधर**). There is, again, the verse **भूमीनाथशहाबदीन**[^2]etc. in which Jagannātha pays highcompliments, courtier-wise, to Shah Jehan. The **आसफबिलास**, as the name only too patently shows, has for itstheme the Nawab Asaf Khan who, as we gather fromhistory, was the favourite Khan Khanan of the EmperorShah Jehan, and who died in 1641 A D. In **जगदाभरण**,Jagannātha praises Dara Sikoh, the eldest son of ShahJehan. From these references, it becomes abundantlyclear that Jagannātha flourished in the reign of ShahJehan, and very probably he began his literary career inthe reign of Jehangir.

 This internal evidence is quite conclusive. Yetthere is an external consideration confirming the internal

evidence. There is a traditional belief[^3] Introduction.")in Jaipur thatSavai Jaya Singh, the Maharajah, performed anAśvamedha sacrifice in 1714 A. D., and sent an invitationto Nageśa Bhatta, the Commentator of Jagannātha'sRasa Gangādhara. It appears from this that NageśaBhatta lived about the first quarter of the 18th century.Now Nageśa Bhatta was removed from Jagannātha by alittle less than two generations: from which it followsthat Jagannātha must have lived about the two middlequarters of the 17th century.

**HIS LIFE.**

 Jagannātha was a Tailang Brahmin by caste, as isseen from the concluding verse of his **प्राणाभरणः तैलङ्गान्वयमङ्गलालयमहालक्ष्मीदयालालितः श्रीमत्परमभट्टसूनुरनिशं विटूल्ललाटंतपः।संतुष्टः कमताधिपस्य कवितामाकर्ण्य तद्वर्णनं श्रीमत्पण्डितराजपण्डितजगन्नाथो व्यध्यासीदिदम्॥** In the opening sentences of **आसफविलालस**also which are quoted above, he refers to himself as**तैलङ्गकुलावतंसेन**. Some Mss. of the Bhāminīvilāsa arereported to have in the colophon the words **‘इति श्री मदखिलान्ध्रवेगिनाडिकुलावतंस—’**etc. from which it appears thatJagannātha was born in the**वेगिनाड**family. The name ofJagannātha’s father was **पेरुभट्ट**, and that of his mother**महालक्ष्मी**. of **वन्दे तं पेरुभट्टाख्यं लक्ष्मीकान्तं महागुरुम्।** R. G.**पेरुभट्ट** seems to have been also known as **पेरमभट्ट** forJagannātha calls himself**पेरुभट्टसूनु** in the concludingstanza of**प्राणाभरण** just quoted above. Jagannātha wascertainly fortunate inasmuch as he was born in afamily with high literary traditions; and particularly hewas so ‘well-fathered’because **पेरुभट्ट**was a man ofconsiderable scholarly attainments, as Jagannātha him-

self says in the opening verses of **रसगङ्गाधर. पेरुभट्ट** hadstudied **वेदान्त** under **ज्ञानेन्द्र भिक्षु, न्याय** and **वैशेषिक** philosophiesunder **महेन्द्रपण्डित, पूर्वमीमांसा** under देव i. e.,**खण्डदेव** inBenares, and the **महाभाष्य** under the grammarian **शेषवीरेश्वर**Small wonder, then, that under these propitious circumstances the boy Jagannātha was brought up with lovingcare by his parents of. **महालक्ष्मीयालालितः** in the verseतैलाङ्गन्वय etc.), and received such education from his fatheras made him eventually the **पण्डितराज**that he turned outto be. Though Jagannātha received his education fromhis father for the most part, yet, seems, he had also satat the feet of **शेषवीरेश्वर,** the guru of his own fatherJagannātha must indeed have had a natural aptitude forthe many-sided scholastic education given to him for wenow know him not merely as a poet of a very high order,but also as an accomplished rhetorician—as the author of**रसगङ्गाधर** : moreover, his mastery over the Science ofGrammar is displayed in the ambitious commentary**मनोरमाकुचमर्दिनी** which was written by him by way of arefutation of **मनोरमा** of **भट्टोजीदीक्षित**.

 The young Pandit, having been fully equippedintellectually, left home and, as is evidenced by his ownwritings, found his way into the Court of the MoghulEmperors under whose warm patronage he passed hisyouthful days, cf. **दिल्लीवल्लभपाणिपल्लवतले नीतं नवीनं वयः।**(**शी. ४५)** So great seems to have been the impressioncreated by the learning and scholarship of this youngPandit at the Imperial Court, that the Emperor ShahJehan conferred on him the title **पण्डितराज**(the Lord ofthe Learned) which, the latter, from thevery frequentmention of it made by him in his works, appears to haveprized very much, cf. **पण्डितराजस्य कवितायाः।**Sānta V. 44.The epithets **पण्डितपति** (Śānta V. 39 ) and **पण्डितनरेन्द्र** (which

Jagannātha uses about himself in a verse at the beginningof the Rasagangādhara) are apparently paraphrases ofthe title **पण्डितराज**. While he was basking in the sunshineof the Imperial Moghul Court, Jagannātha seems to havereceived very warm attentions from at least two otherindividuals besides the Emperor. In the Āsafvilāsa, helavishes the highest praises[^4] on. Nawab Asafkhan, thefavourite Khan khanan of Shah Jehan, though it is to benoted that the initiative for the composition of theĀsafvilāsa came from Rai Mukund. of. **रायमुकुन्देनादिष्टेन**etc. in the passage **अथसकललोक** etc. quoted above. Dara Sikoh,the eldest son of Shah Jehan, is eulogized by Jagannāthain his **जगदाभरण**. Apart from the sense of gratitude to thisprince for the generous treatment which the latter mighthave given him, Jagannātha must have had a specialbond of affection for him, because Dara was himself akeen student of Sanskrit.

[^4]: "Cf. the following verses found in R. G.—  सुधेव वाणी वसुधेव मूर्तिः सुधाकरश्रीसदृशी च कीर्तिः। पयोधिकल्पा मतिरासफेन्दोर्महीतलेऽन्यस्य नहीति मन्ये॥  युक्तं तु याते दिवनासफेन्दौ तदाश्रितांना यदभूर्द्वनाशः। इदं तु चित्रं भुवनावकाशे निराश्रया खेलति तस्य कीर्तिः॥"

  Various episodes purporting to give interestingdetails in the life of Jagannātha are current among thepeople; but none of them is corroborated by any unimpeachable external or internal evidence. One of suchepisodes persistently believed by the people would showthat while Jagannātha was at the Court of the MoghulEmperor, he was smitten with love for a young Moslemdamsel whom, it is said, he ultimately married. In

सुधेव वाणी वसुधेव मूर्तिः सुधाकरश्रीसदृशी च कीर्तिः।  
पयोधिकल्पा मतिरासफेन्दोर्महीतलेऽन्यस्य नहीति मन्ये॥

युक्तं तु याते दिवनासफेन्दौ तदाश्रितांना यदभूर्द्वनाशः।  
इदं तु चित्रं भुवनावकाशे निराश्रया खेलति तस्य कीर्तिः॥

support of this, various—now famous—verses[^5]ascribed to Jagannātha are quoted as showing his fondness for the**यवनी**. Further, it is said that in old age Jagannāthawent to Kāśi, but there he was condemned as a mandepraved on account of the association with a यवनीJagannātha, however, thought otherwise; he went to thebanks of the Ganges, and with keen fervour began to singverses[^6] in praise of the holy river. In response, it is said,the water of the river began to rise higher and higher tillJagannātha was given a full bath and had his purityattested.

[^5]: "यवनी रमणी विपदः शमनी कमनीयतमा नवनीतसमा। उहिऊहिवचोऽमृतपूर्णमुखी स सुखी जगतीह यदङ्कगता॥१॥  यवनी नवनीतकोमलाङ्गी शयनीये यदि नीयते कदाचित्। अवनीतलमेव साधु मन्ये न वनी माघवनी विनोदहेतुः॥२॥  न याचे गजालिं न वा वाजिराजिं न वित्तेषु चित्तं मदीयं कदापि। इयं सुस्तनी मस्तकन्यस्तहस्ता लवङ्गी कुरङ्गीदृगङ्गीकरोतु॥३॥"

[^6]: "These verses form the गङ्गालहरी."

 Now, as has already been remarked, there is nounchallengeable internal or external evidence corroborating this traditional episode which has been current,however, with remarkable persistency. As for the versescited in this connection, they are not found in any of thewritings of Jagannātha. Even granting their authenticity,there is no reason why they must be regarded as beingpersonal to Jagannātha in application. And the Gangālahari does not betray a single hint as to its genesis. It isthoroughly devotional in character; and there is nothing init which might preclude the supposition that it might havebeen composed under any other different set of circum-

stances. Moreover, Jagannātha was a scrupulous, piousBrahmin. It follows therefore that the traditional beliefis not corroborated by the writings of Jagannātha. Butthe tradition gains colour when we take into account theatmosphere at the Imperial Moghul Court. One point,however, is certain: The Pandit could not have marrieda yavana girl. He may perhaps have associated with ayavani, following the prevailing custom at the MoghulCourt. This keeping of a yavani, too, must have madeJagannātha a sinner and a derelict in the eyes of theBrahmins of Benares.

 In later years of life, Jagannātha seems to haveceased taking interest in worldly affairs, and bent onpassing the remainder of his days in piety and peace.From the 45th verse of the Śāntavilāsa**संप्रत्युञ्झितवानंमधुपुरीमध्ये हरिः सेव्यते।** it appears that he settled in **मधुपुरी**i. e.**मथुरा**, and passed his days in the devotion of Hari.This fact would cut right across the common belief thatthe Pandit passed his last days on the banks of theGanges—in Kāśi. This common view seems to be basedon the verse **किं निःशंकं शेषे शेषे वयसस्तवागतो मृत्युः। अथवा सुखशयीथा निकटे जागार्ति जाह्नवी जननी॥**(Śānta V. 31). WhenJagannātha went to Kāśi and settled there in old age,Appayya Diksita is said to have taunted him by sayingthat it was no use to be indifferent at the fag end of life,for Death is almost at the door. To this Jagannātha gavethe brilliant retort that there was no danger to himbecause Mother Ganges was near by to take care of him.From this incident, it appears that Jagannātha passed hislast days in Kāsi. How then are these two mutuallydiscordant pieces of evidence to be explained? There is,of course, another reading in place of the line **संप्रत्युज्झितवासनं मधुपुरीमध्ये हरिः सेव्यते।** This Variant reads: **संप्रत्यन्धक**-

**शासनस्य नगरे तत्त्वं परं चिन्त्यते।** (The highest truth is contemplated now in the city of Siva i. e. Kāśī); this latterreading seems on the face of it to have been the concoctionof some Pundit who, being already aware of the incidentbetween Jagannātha and Appayya Dixit, felt the absurdityof the present reading and wanted to do away with it. Itis open to us, in the last resort, to conclude, as it isalready suggested, that Jagannātha may have lived forsome time both in Kāśī and in Mathurā in his last days.

**JAGANNĀTHAAS A MAN.**

 Jagannātha must have been a man of ambitions inlife, for, as we have already seen, after finishing hisstudies he left his native place and travelled abroad.His temperament seems to have been emotionallysensitive, as can be seen from his dealings with others.His attitude towards his parents is one not onlyof warm filial love but also of reverence. The parentswho had taken so much care to bring up their son wererewarded by the gratefulness and affection which thelatter cherished for them. To his patron, the Emperor,Jagannātha bore high loyalty, which is shown by thewarmth of feeling with which the Emperor is referred toby him, whenever an occasion arises for him to do so.This emotional sensitivity bordered on impulsiveness.His emotional response to any stimulus was very great.And it is to this source indeed that are to be traced thewarm love and loyalty on the one hand, and the violentantagonism, on the other, both of which Jagannāthashowed. He was as loyal and friendly to his patron andothers as he was hostile to his foes. He undertook to writehis refutation of **मनोरमा**of Bhattoji Dixit mainly becauseBhattoji Dixit had turned “faithless to his Guru”—anattitude which Jagannātha could never understand, much

less connive at. With virtuous indignation and pride,he asserts: **पण्डितेन्द्रो जगन्नाथः स्यति गर्वं गुरुद्रुहाम्.** This sameemotional impulsiveness, again, explains the arrogant.looking personal references which Jagannātha makes inhis writings. His scornful attitude towards other poets,his high estimation of his own abilities, the arrogantvein in his writings—these proceed from the impetuoustemperament of the emotional poet.

 Yet, Jagannātha was a scrupulous man. None but aconscientious heart could adopt such a touching attitudeas Jagannātha did, when, laden with years and experienceof the world, he tried to look back upon the variedpageant of the past and take a review of how he hadlived all along: **शास्त्राण्याकलितानि नित्यविधयः सर्वेऽपि संभावितादिल्लीवल्लभप णिपल्लवतले नीतं नवीनं वयः। संप्रत्युज्झितवासनं मधुपुरीमध्ये हरिःसेव्यते सर्वं पण्डितगजराजि-तिलकंनाकारि लोकाधिकम्॥** This verseshows how eager Jagannātha was to shape hislife in accordance with the Vedic injunctions. It alsoshows the religious nature of Jagannātha. As a matterof fact the devotional compositions like **गङ्गालहरी, अमृतलहरी,करुणालहरि** all show the religious attitude of the poet. TheSāntavilāsa shows Jagannātha as a fervent devotee ofViṣņu, or Śrīkṛsna. He was a Vaiṣṇava of the Advaitaor Śānkara school.

**JAGANNĀTHA’S WORKS.**

 From among about a dozen compositions ofJagannātha, there are four or five which are well-known,A reference is already made to the famous lyricalpoem **गङ्गालहरी**which is full of devotion and reverential emotion. The **मनोरमाकुचमर्दिनी** was composed byJagannātha with the set purpose, as the title itselfshows, of refuting the **मनोरमा** in which Bhattoji

Dixit had propounded certain views contrary to thoseheld by Śeṣaśrīkṛṣṇa who was the Guru of Bhattoji Dixit.The **चित्रमीमांसाखण्डनम्** is a work on Rhetoric and iscomposed in order to point out the faults in **चित्रमीमांसा**, acomposition by Appayya Dixit. But by far better knownand looked upon as a standard work on Rhetoric is the**रसगङ्गाधर**. In this work Jagannātha examines and refutesthe views of his illustrious predecessors and expounds hisown. While this work shows the masterly knowledge ofJagannātha of the science of Poetics, it shows him at thesame time as an able writer both in prose and verse.His prose is characterized, as Prof. Kane has well observed,by a lucid and vigorous style and displays great criticalacumen. In his exposition of a topic, Jagannātha hadto cite examples. But, conscious as he was of his ownpoetic powers, he disdained to draw upon others andcomposed his own verses suitable to the topic undertreatment. With great elation he says in the beginningof the **रसगङ्गाधर :–निर्माय नूतनमुदाहरणानुरूपं काव्यं मयात्र निहितं नपरस्य किञ्चित्। किं सेव्यते सुमनसां मनसापि गन्धः कस्तूरिकाजननशक्तिभृता.मृगेण॥** His stanzas bear testimony to the poetical abilityof the Pandit. “They are composed in an easy, flowingand graceful style and exhibit great poetic talent”. The**भामिनीविलास** is a poetical composition which is alsowell-known. Jagannātha himself enumerates thequalities of his poetry in a stanza in the **करुणविलासः निर्दूषणागुणवती रसभावपूर्णा सालङ्कृतिः श्रवणकोमलवर्णराजिः। सा मामकीन कवितेवमनोऽभिरामा रामा कदापि हृदयान्मम नापयाति॥** (6) It has tobe admitted that this evaluation of his own poetry byJagannātha is, to a great extent, correct. There is aspecial quality of his poems which Jagannātha refers tonow and then in the concluding stanzas of the Śāntavilasa,and on which he prides himself. It is **मााधुर्य**. In hisopinion (cf. Śāntavilāsa, 42), a poetical composition is

worth its name only if this quality, **माधुर्य**, is present in it**माधुर्य**is one of the ten qualities of **काव्य** and partakes of atwofold nature—**शाब्द**and **आर्थ**. The ‘Verbal Sweetness’**(शाब्दमाधुर्य)** is defined by Jagannātha as: **संयोगपरह्स्वातिरिक्तवर्णघटितत्वे सति पृथक्पदत्वं माधुर्यम।**‘Verbal Sweetness’isgained by the use of separate words while at the sametime avoiding short syllables followed by conjuncts.And the ‘Sweetness of sense’ **(आर्थमाधुर्य)** is defined as:**एकस्या एवोक्तेर्भङ्गयन्तरेण पुनः कथनात्मकमुक्तिवैचित्र्यं माधुर्यम्।**The‘Sweetness of sense’is the variety of expressing one andthe same idea in different charming ways. The **भामिनीविलास**, of course, is characterized by this two-fold **माधुर्य.**and Jagannātha’s claim has to be conceded.

 However, attention must be drawn to certain drawbacks in Jagannātha's poetry from our own point of view.One such is his mannerisms. Sometimes he prefers anawkward way of expressing an idea to a direct andsimple expression of the same. An illustration in pointis the use of the expression **पुष्टिं तन्** in the line **यत्पिषतामपिनृृणां पिष्टोऽपि तनोषि परिमलैः पुष्टिम्।**He means to say, ‘Thoudelightest with thy fragrance etc.’ But instead of directlysaying so, he uses the rather awkward phrase **पुष्टिं तनोषि,**‘Thou dost bring about the nourishment or satisfactionresulting therefrom’. **संतापमाला**in vs. 15 in the Prūstāvikavilāsa is another phrase showing the same drawback.It is not difficult to perceive why Jagannātha used thephrase **पुष्टितन्**in the context. The reason is, and thatshows another drawback, Jagannātha's great love foralliteration. This passionate love for an alliterativeeffect is responsible for the occasional use of roundabout expressions. In fairness to the Pandit, however, itmust be noted that much of whatever artificiality is seen

in his poetry is to be attributed to the literary conventionscurrent in his time.

**BHĀMINĪVILĀSA.**

 It is not possible to say exactly what the title wasmeant by the Pandit to convey. It is surmised that theBhāminīvilāsa was composed by Jagannātha for thedelight and edification of his wife whose name, it is tobe supposed, was **भामिनी**. The word, **भामिनी,**occurs severaltimes in the **भा. वा.** e.g., in the opening verse of the**शृङ्गारविलीस;**also in the 3rd and 17th stanzas of the**करुणविलास.**On the contrary, it may be supposed that thework is so called because Jagannātha has therein,especially in the **शृङ्गारविलास,** described the graces of abeautiful woman. The purpose for which the Bhāminīviläsa was ‘composed’is altogether different, as thepoet says in the last verse of the Śāntavilāsa. Hemakes no mention of **भमिनी** in this connection, butsimply says that he wanted thereby to preserve hispoetical gems from plagiarists.

 The Bhāminīvilasa consists of four vilāsas, out ofwhich the first and the last are edited here. Thereseems to be no vital connection between the variouscilasas except the fact that the second and the thirdcilasas describe a beautiful woman from different pointsof view. There is a certain unity of nature in thecontents of the three vilāsas except the first which, likethe whole work, is an anthology. In the Prastavikavilasathe poet praises good men, censures the wicked, eulogizesvirtues like genosity, helpfulness, etc., draws attention tothe changing wheel of Fortune-indeed, he looks at Lifeas it is, and bodies forth his impressions in the form ofverses. In the other vilasas, on the other hand, there isa respective unity of theme which is treated in an ample,varied way.

 105 On hearing the low thunder (of the cloud), the cub of a lion, born just half a night before, contracts his limbs in order to bound forth, and (in so doing) conceals himself in his mother's lap.

 100 Whrt shall I say. O divinely intelligent rogue, about your honour's partiality for merits? for neither by day nor during the night do you forget any (lit. all) good men endowed with good qualities?

 107 Thou villain, surely I shall reveal in detail (lit. having discussed) thy activities in the presence of learned men : or, why, away, thou sinful soul, with even the accursed talk about thee.

 108 The company of a rogue is the forest conflagration to the deer in the form of joy, an intoxicated elephant to the tree of good behaviour, and a forceful gale to the lamp of knowledge!

 44 This sweetness of the poetry of the Panditarājais surely worthy to be respected even by the outstanding sweetnesses of grapes, milk, sugar-cane, honey,and ambrosia.

 45 Śāstras have been perused; all the enjoinedreligious rites, too, have been observed. The primeof life has been spent comfortably under (literally, inthe sprout-like palm of) the lord of Delhi.

**PRĀSTĀVIKAVILĀSA.**

 **प्रास्ताविक विलास—प्रास्ताविक**–Introductory.**प्रस्तावःप्रयोजनं अस्य.‘प्रयोजनम्’**(Pān.5. 1. 109) **इति ठक्**. This Vilāsa is calledIntroductory, presumably, because the Bhāminīvilāsa openswith it. At the same time it is to be noted that there is nointegral connection between this Vilāsa and the others thatfollow it. Indeed, the commentator does not call it**प्रास्ताविकविलास**, but the **अन्योक्त्युल्लास—**a title certainly more to thepoint, inasmuch as it carries with it a general hint about thenature of its contents. Another point to be noted in thisconnection is that the title, whichever of the two is accepted, ofthis vilāsa, does not conform to the uniformity which is evidentin the titles of other vilāsas. While the subsquent vilāsasderive their titles from the sentiment prevailing throughout theverses contained in them, this vilāsa, in the first place, has nosuch individual sentiment predominant in it; and, secondly, thetitle is not therefore connected with any sentiment whatever.**विलास**–from the rt. **लस्** with **वि**, to shine, or to play.

 Vs. 1.—**मद–**Ichor. From the temples of elephants, it issaid, a fluid with a very bitter smell oozes out. cf. Ragh. V.47and 48. For the idea of rutting **दिग्गज**, compare: **दिग्गज इवानवरतप्रवृत्तदानाद्रींकृतकरः**—Kād. The idea of rutting elephants seems tobe a favourite one with Jagannātha: he refers to it again andagain, e. g., in verses 25, 30, 58, 59 etc. **कराटिनः—**Elephants.**करट–**The temples of elepėants. **‘काकेभगण्डौ करौ’–अमर**. It isbelieved in mythology that there are eight quarter-elephants,one in each of the eight major points of the compass. Theirnames are: **ऐरावतः पुण्डरीको वामनः कुमुदोऽञ्जनः। पुष्पदन्तः सार्वभौमः सुप्रतीकश्चदिग्गजाः॥ अमर. करिण्यः कारुण्यास्पदम्—**The code of chivalry forbidsall–especially strong men, to lay violent hands on a female.cf. **स्त्रीषु गोषु न शस्त्राणि पातयेद् ब्राह्मणेषु च। यस्य चान्नानि भुञ्जीत यत्रच स्यात्प्रतिश्रयः॥ इति सन्तोऽनुशासन्ति सज्जनं धर्मिणः सदा।** Mbh. 2. 41. 13,f. (CitraśālāP. Edition); also, **अवध्यां च स्त्रियं प्राहुस्तिर्यग्योनिगतामपि.**

**असमशिलाः—**The deer are timid, and, therefore, are no matchfor the Lord of beasts. **अनुपमशिखानाम–**Exceptionally sharp;lit; whose edges are incomparable. **उपमीयते अनया इति उपमा** (Astandard of comparison); **न विद्यते उपमा यासां ताः अनुपमाः, अनुपमाःशिखाः (अग्राणि) येषां तेषाम्। नखानां पाण्डित्यम्–**Does not the expression sound rather pedantic?

 Now, what strikes the reader about this opening stanza ofthe Bhāminīvilāsa is the absence of а **मङ्गल**which traditionamong Sanskrit writers prescribes with a view to ensure anunobstructed completion of the work about to be composed.Cf. **मङ्गलादीनि मङ्गलमध्यानि मङ्गलान्तानि च शास्त्राणि प्रथन्ते** eto.—**महाभाष्य.**Also cf. **आशीर्नमस्क्रियावस्तुनिर्देशो वापि तन्मुखम्।** No doubt some readthe verse **माधुर्यपरमसीमा[^7]by the churning of the ocean of Learning, and because it givesmuch happiness to the ‘drinkers’.")**etc. before this verse and probablyattempt thereby to supply a benedictory stanza of the **वस्तुनिर्देशात्मक** type. But this verse cannot be accepted as the genuineopening stanza of the Bhāminīvilāsa, because, for one thing,neither the Calcutta edition nor the Nirṇaya Sāgar editionnotices it. And, secondly, the contents of the stanza are of avery general character[^8]. Such a general and, after all, tameopening is not likely in Jagannātha—that highly self-consciouspoet as we know him from the opening verses of R. G. and

[^7]: "माधुर्यपरमसीमा सारस्वतजलधिमथनसंभूता। पिबतामनल्पसुखदा बसुधायां ननु सुधा कविता॥   The stanza is read as above in Rasagangādhara, p. 306.   Translation.—Poetry is nectar, indeed, on earth for it isthe highest water-mark of sweetness, it is produced (likenectar which arose from the milky ocean when it was churned

[^8]: "The substitution of ममin place of ननुcan hardly becountenanced in view of the fact that नागेशभट्ट,who was removed from Jagannātha by less than two generations, reads ननुinhis commentary on this verse in the R. G."

 1.**माधुर्यपरमसीमा सारस्वतजलधिमथनसंभूता।  
   पिबतामनल्पसुखदा बसुधायां ननु सुधा कविता॥**

** **The stanza is read as above in Rasagangādhara, p. 306.

 Translation.—Poetry is nectar, indeed, on earth for it isthe highest water-mark of sweetness, it is produced (likenectar which arose from the milky ocean when it was churned)by the churning of the ocean of Learning, and because it givesmuch happiness to the ‘drinkers’.

 2. The substitution of **मम**in place of **ननु**can hardly becountenanced in view of the fact that **नागेशभट्ट,**who was removed from Jagannātha by less than two generations, reads **ननु**inhis commentary on this verse in the R. G.

from the concluding ones of Bhāminīvilāsa as well. The poetwho is careful enough to add more than half a dozen stanzasof personal eulogistic references at the end of the Śāntavilāsa,and who avers that he has culled these verses of his togetherto keep them safe from literary pirates may certainly be expected not to open **ग्रन्थ**his merely with a verse of such dubiousrelevance. The characteristic opening of Jagannātha is vigorous and rather ample—both of which qualities are certainlyabsent in the present case.

 It seems, therefore, that Jagannātha has here infringed theestablished tradition which otherwise he follows. Probably,this breach of tradition is to be attributed to the fact that theBhāminīvilāsa is not an integral composition. As Jagannāthaadmits in the last stanza of the Śāntavilāsa, the Bhāminīvilāsa is an anthology of the verses which the poet had composed and which he wanted to preserve from plagiarists. Onaccount of this promiscuous nature of its contents, Jagannātha does not seem to have thought it his worth while toendow the Bhāminīvilāsa with his characteristic openingVerses.

 Commentatorial ingenuity, however, has been too wideawake to allow the charge of a breach of tradition to rest onJagannātha’s head. Consequently, we are told by thecommentator **अच्युतराय** that the verse **दिगन्ते श्रूयन्ते** etc. is itselfa**मङ्गल** of the **वस्तुनिर्देशात्मक** type, and, as such, it yields no lessthan three different interpretations! According to him**मृगपति** stands for (i) the **नृसिंह** incarnation of **विष्णु**; or (ii)**परशुराम** who protected the Brahmins seeking **(मृग)** truth; or(iii)**कृष्ण** who is the husband **(पति)** of Gopis and acts likea deer **(मृगवत्पतिः)** for he roams about in the forest![^9]
All these,

 अप्रस्तुतप्रशंसा स्यात्

—S. D. 10. 58-59.

cause is understood from an effect, e. g. in 73, 52 below (**गिरिगह्वरेषु** etc.) in the last pāda it is said ‘the earth will have onlythe female-elephants left behind’, though what is really intended is ‘the cub of the lion will devour you’. Here the causeis conveyed through the mention of the effect. iv. When aneffect is conveyed through the mention of a cause, e. g., in vs.51 below (**स्थितिं नो रे दध्या**etc.), the elephant is asked not to stayin that forest region, for the lion, the enemy of elephants, issleeping nearby. From this it is meant that if the lion, beingawake, finds the elephant there, he will surely kill him. Here,therefore, an effect is understood from the mention of a cause;and lastly, v., when a thing is conveyed through the description of another similar thing, for instance, in the presentverse (**दिगन्ते** etc.).

 In the present verse the poet's intention is not indeedto convey the merely literal meaning. Obviously, he wishesto speak of a very powerful individual—or, probably about hisown self as an unrivalled poet—who finds no worthy opponent,and disdains to massacre the innocent or the weak. Therefore,he stands superior to all, though yearning for a worthy fighter.Instead of saying all this in so many words, the author drawsupon the analogy of a lion—and thus succeeds in driving hispoint home in an effective, though indirect, way.

 As a matter of fact, almost all the verses in this vilāsacontain the figure **अप्रस्तुतप्रशंसा**and therefore mean more thanwhat meets the eye.

 The metre of this verse is **शिखरिणी. रसैरुद्रैश्छिन्ना यमनसमला गःशिखरिणी।**

 Vs. 2.—**विकच°-विकचानां (विकसितानां) सारसानां आलिः तस्याः स्खलद्भिःपरागैः (पुष्परेणुभिः) सुरभीकृते। सुरभीकृत–**A **च्वि**form **न सुरभि असुरभि,असुरभि सुरभि संपद्यमानं कृतं सुरभीकृतम्. ‘अभूततद्भावे च्विः,–**See Pān. 5.4.50.**मानस**-The Mānasa lake is believed to be the favouriteresort of flamingoes. Cf. **पश्चात् सरः प्रति गमिष्यसि मानसं तत्** etc.–Vik, IV. 15., also Megh. 81. **मराल–**A swan.

 The metre is **पृथ्वी. जसौ जसयलावसुग्रहयतिश्च पृथ्वी गुरुः।**

 In this verse, the poet refers to the pangs of one whohas fallen from a high position, and is constrained to live inlow surroundings. A conscientious man cannot accept achange for the worse in his position with equanimity, for suchdegradation forces him to live among people of a lowerstratum than he is used to. Compare **सुखात्तुयो याति नरो दरिद्रतां धृतःशरीरेण मृतः स जीवति**-Mṛchh. I.

 Vs. 3.—The first three pādas contain various Loc. Abs.constructions. **लोल-**Tremulous. **चकोरीगण**-the cakora, male orfemale, is a bird which is believed to pine for the sight of themoon in order to quench its thirst with her rays. cf. **किंचासिताक्षि मृगलाञ्छनसंभ्रमेण चञ्चूपुटं चटुलयन्ति चिरं चकोराः।** Bhām. 2.73;also, **चकोर्य एव चतुराश्चन्द्रिकापानकर्मणि। कैरव–**A night–lotus. Thenight-lotuses open at the sight of the moon. of. **कुमुदान्येव शशाङ्कःसबिता बोधयति पंकजान्येव**–Śak 5, 28 **मौनं मुच्**.—The poet looks uponthe closed lotus flowers as modest and bashful, and thereforesilent. But about the time of moon-rise, they begin tobloom, i. e., to shed off their silence. **मौनं मुच्** therefore means ‘toopen’.The expression is pregnant, indeed. **प्रस्थातुकाम**Desirousto start. **प्रस्थातु कामः यस्य सः**. The Anusvāra of the Inf. ofpurpose is dropped in accordance with the dictum **लुम्पदवश्यःकृत्ये तुं काममनर्सोरपि। आडम्बर**–A pompeus show, hence, muster.**‘आडम्बरः समारम्भे, विश्व.**

** **The metre is **शार्दूलविक्रीडित. सूर्याश्वर्यदिमः सजौ सततगाः शार्दूलविक्रीडितम्।**

** **Power must be helpfully exercised. Imagination andconsiderateness will only embellish it, and distinguish it fromsavagery. Cf. ‘Tis good to have a giant’s strength; butit’s monstrous to use it like a giant’.

 Vs 4.—**स्यन्दमान–**Oozing out.The variant **स्पन्दमान**meant‘bubbling out’. Note the effect of alliteration in the first twopadas. **मञ्जु—**Adv., Sweetly. निरपेक्षः—Not caring (to be rewarded). **तावकीन–**Thy. Formed by the addition of **स्वञ् (ईन)**

according to**‘युष्मदस्मदोरन्यरस्यां खञ्च’**—Pān. 4. 3. 1, the adeśa**नवक** being had by the sūtra **‘तवकममकवेकवचने’**—Pān 4. 3. 3.

 The metre is **मालिनी, ननमयययुतेयं मालिनी भोगिलोकैः।**

** **It is not the dependants or the hangers-on that may beexpected to do justice to the good qualities of their patron. There always are men with an appreciative eye, who of theirown accord proclaim the merits of others, and yet expect noreward. Virtue will out—through appreciative, yet disinterested, men.

 Vs. 5.—**अवहेला इ**-is used here in the causal sense, i. e.,it is equivalent to **अवहेलां गमय्,** tosubject to denunciation, todespise. **कुटज**–A kind of tree with a bitter smell, blossomingin the rainy season. It is looked upon as worthless andinsignificant, **तुन्दिल**-with a protuberating belly, hence, bursting with. **तुन्दिलस्तुन्दिभस्तुन्दी बृहत्कुक्षिःपिचण्डिल :–अमर.** The metre is**गीति** (a modification of **आर्या**). **आर्याप्रथमार्धसमं यस्याः परार्धमीरितां गीतिः।**

** **The poet warns low and ignorant people against beingindifferent or discourteous, through meanness or ignorance,to great men who are held in high esteem in higher circles.

 V8., 6.—**यावत्-तावत्**-As long as, till. **यापय**-2 sing., Imp.cans. of **या** to go; **यापय्**-To pass. **विरसान्**-cheerless **वनान्तर-अन्यद्वनंवनान्तरम्. मिललिमालः—मिलन्त्यःअलीनां मालाःयस्मिन् सः**—About whichswarms of bees hover.

 The metre is **आर्या.**

**यस्याः पादे प्रथमे द्वादशमात्रास्तथा तृतीयेऽपि।  
अष्टादश द्वितीये चतुर्थके पञ्चदश सार्या॥**

 The cycle of fortune spares none-not even those who arehabituated to a life of ease & comfort. They should somehow pass the period of adverse circumstances with faith inthe future. Fortune that has frowned will smile-in thefulness of time. Patience, of course, till then! For the idea.compare **विपदि धैर्यमथाम्युदये क्षमा** etc.–Bhar. 1. 63. A lso cf. **विपद्यच्चैस्थेयम्**etc.—Ibid. 1. 28.

 Vs. 7.—In this stanza various words bear & doublemeaning—one referring to the well, and the other to a lowly but appreciative man to whom, in fact, the stanza is addressed.**नीच**—(i) Deep, (ii) Lowly, one in a low station of life. **कृथाः**Really **अकृथाः,**2 Sing. Aor. of **कृ**. When a verb in the Aor. isused with **माङ्**(the negative particle **मा**), it comes to possessthe sense of the Imperative, and drops the temporal augment.**‘न माङ्योगे’. अत्यन्तसरसहृदयः—अत्यन्तं सरप्तंहृदयं यस्य सः.** Here theword **रस** in connection with the well means ‘water’, and **हृदय**means ‘the interior’. The well has much water in its interior. The second meaning applicable to the lowly man is‘whose heart is very appreciative’.**रस** in this connectionmeans the sensibility to perceive and appreciate. **गुण—**(i) Acord, (ii) A good quality.

 The metre is **गीति**.

 A keen sensibility to recognize and receive good qualitiesfrom others more than redeems the lowly station of life inwhich one may happen to find oneself.

 Vs. 8.—**मलिनीकृ–**To render dirty, to disappoint. A **च्वि**form. **अनभिज्ञ–अभिजानाति इति अभिज्ञः न अभिज्ञः अनभिज्ञः**, ignorant.**परिणत.**—Matured, ripened. **मार्मिकाः—मर्माणि जानन्ति इति मार्मिकाः,**those who know the essence.

 The metre is **पुष्पिताग्रा, अयुजिनयुगरेफतो यकारो यजि च नजौ जरगाश्चपुष्पिताग्रा।**

** **There will be not a few in the world who busy themselveswith sniffing at men whose real greatness they cannot understand. One should not mind their croakings. Greatness orbeauty shall ever have its connoisseurs-the only personswhose opinion should carry.

 This verse and verse 4 above are in the same vein. thoughthere is a subtle distinction in the scope of their meanings. Inverse 4 the poet looks upon the bees with scant regard, whilehere in this verse he invests them with a dignity of their own.

 Vs. 9.—**अमन्द–**Ample. **अनायिघत–**3 pers. Plu. pass. Aor. of**नी.** Construe the latter half of the stanza thus: **हा तेन मधुकरेणकथं खलु कुटजे ईहा तेने। तेने–**3 per. sing. pass. Perf. of**तन्**–toextend. **ईहा—**Longing.

 The metre is **आर्या.**

 Can those who know better be so fallen as to stoop low,and insult their own knowledge & dignity? Experienceperhaps replies, yes! This fickleness on the part of bettermen is deplored by the poet here. One can imagine how inthe light of this stanza Jagannatha would have raised hishands in horror at ShrīKṛṣṇa for **अतीव सुन्दरतमा हित्वा व्रजस्त्रीरसोयत्कुब्जां चकमे...!**

** **Vs. 10.—**मलयज–**Sandal wood; here, the sandal tree.**उद्+गृ** 6.Conj., to vomit, to eject. **परिमलोद्गारैः—**With effusions of perfume.

 The metre is **गीति.**

 The large–minded overlook the wickedness of others, andeven oblige their enemies. **उदारचरितानां तु वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम्** isliterally true of them.

 Vs. 11.—**पाटीर**—Sandalwood. **‘पटाः सन्ति यस्य स पटी तन्तुवायःतद्वत् ईरयति स्वगुणानन्वत्र पटादौ स यथा प्रेरयति तद्वत्स्वनिष्ठसौरभ्यादि धर्माश्चन्दनद्रुमादौ प्रेरयतीति पटीरो मलयाचलस्तत्र भवः पाटीरस्तत्संबुद्धावायिमलयनिलय चन्दनइत्यर्थः।–अच्युतराय. पटीयान्–अतिशयेन पटुः** very clever, **उरीकर्तुम्–**toimbibe, to adopt. **पटीयाटी–**Mode, habit. **पुष्टिं तन्–**Merely means‘to delight;’ the poet is obviously drawn into the use of this.laboured phrase by the lure of alliteration. This satisfactionhe has earned only at the cost of directness. The metreis **गीति.**

** **The idea is much the same as in the preceding verse. of**घृष्टं घृष्टं पुनरपि पुनश्चन्दनं चारुगन्धि।**

** **Vs. 12.—**नीरक्षीरविवेक–नीरक्षीरयोः विवेकः,** Distinguishing between water and milk. The swans are said to possess thepower to separate milk from its mixture with water. The

well-known **हंसोड़कन्याय** is based on this belief, cf. **हंसो हिक्षीरमादत्ते तन्मिश्रा वर्जयत्यपः।** Śāk. 6. 28.

 The metre is **आयी.**

 The responsibility of the great is great indeed. Failureor indifference to their duties will have a very bad effect uponothers. If they neglect their duties, who else may not? cf.**यद्यदाचरति श्रेष्ठस्तत्तदेवेतरो जनः। स यत्प्रमाणं कुरुते लोकस्तदनुवर्तते॥** Bh. G.3. 21. Kautilya’s observations, **राजानमुत्तिष्ठमानमनूत्तिष्ठन्ते भृत्याः।प्रमाद्यन्तमनुप्रमाद्यन्ति॥** (chap. 16), are equally applicable to anyleader of men, enthroned or otherwise.

 Ve. 13.**—उपरि**-In appearance.**करवालधाराकाराः—करवालस्य(खङ्गस्य) धारा इव(क्रूरः) आकारोयेषां ते. आकार–**Shape, appearance. **करवाल०**Who are deadly–looking like the edge of a sword. **भुजंगमपुङ्गव**the best—and that means the worst-of serpents. Words like**पुङ्गव, ऋषभ, व्याघ्र,** etc. are used as the latter member of a compound in the sense of ‘the best’ . cf. **स्युरुत्तरपदे व्याघ्रपुङ्गवर्षभकुञ्जराः।सिंहशार्दूलनागाद्याः पुंसि श्रेष्ठार्थगोचराः॥ अमर. अन्त :—**At heart. **द्राक्षादीक्षागुरव** :—The preceptor initiates a novice; and he is alwayssuperior to his pupil in point of knowledge. In the same waythese rare men are so kind-hearted and therefore so ‘sweet’that they may well be the preceptors of grapes in point ofsweetness.

 The metre is **गीति**;but the second pāda jolts very badlytowards the end, for it is defective in rhythm. It is laiddown that no odd gaṇa (a unit of four mātrās) should be **ज**<MISSING_FIG href="../books_images/U-IMG-1725287383090104-removebg-preview.png"/>in an Āryā. Here, however, the rule is violated, for theseventh gana is a **जगण**. Hence the awkwardness in rhythm.Cf. **आर्यापूर्वार्धे ‘नेह भवति विषमे जः’इति नियमादत्र च विषमे सप्तमस्थाने जगणस्यसत्त्वाच्छन्दोभङ्गदूषितमेतदार्यापूर्वार्धमिति ज्ञेयम्।** R. G. p. 275 n.

 Vs. 14.—**स्वच्छन्दम्**—At will,**हरिदन्तराणि–**The intervalsbetween the quarters.

 The metre is **प्रहर्षिणीयम्. म्नौज्रौग्रस्त्रिदशयतिः प्रहर्षिणीयम्.**Thecontents of this verse are identical with those of stanza 4 above.

Vs. 15.—**मिहिर**–The Sun. **संतापमालाकृला—**Oppressed withexcessive heat. **संतापमाला—**The phrase is a man erism. **निरन्तराधिपटलैः—निर्गतमन्तरं येभ्यस्ते निरन्तराः निरन्तरायानाधीनां पटलैः (समूहैः)। निरन्तर**–Uninterrupted **आधि–**Anguish.**‘पुंस्याधिनीनमी व्यथा’–अमर, जीवनम्–**Thevariant **जीवितम्**is not so good. **जीवनं** yields two meanings (i)Life, existence, (ii) Water.

 Tha metre is **शार्दूलविक्रीडितम्**.

 Service to others in need is praised here by the poet as aworthy ideal. Better to die and be useful to others than existmerely for one's own self. cf. **पर्यायपीतस्य सुरेर्हिमांशोः कलाक्षयःश्लाक्ष्यतरो हि वृद्धेः।**Ragh. 5. 16.

 Vs. 16—**पतङ्ग** A bird. **रमालमुकुलानि–**The tender sprouts onthe mango–tree. त्वयि **संकेचमञ्चति**-When thou art thinned i. e.when thou art dried up. It is a Loc. Abs. construction. **गति**Recourse, Alternative. The bees hover about the lotus–flowers in search of honey. When, however, the lake driesup, and the lotuses fade, they unscrupulously migrate toanother more congenial resort-the mango-tree, as the poet sayshere. The bees and the birds are only casual visitors of the lake:they stay as long as it suits them. The fish, on the otherhand, is a habitual dweller in the lake. Its plight certainlybecomes tragic when the lake dries, for it cannot shift to anyother place.

 The metre is **वसन्ततिलका, उक्ता वसन्ततिलका तभजा जगौ गः।**

** **Prosperity will bring many a friend, but few will proveloyal and abiding when adversity tries them. Yet there willever be some who are solely dependent on us, and will have toshare our misery. They are to be pitied indeed!

 Vs. 17.—**मा मंस्थाः–**Do not presume. **सौरभलोम—**Greed for thyperfume. The bee has a greed for the honey of the lotus-plant.The common element sought to be denied is not **सौरभलोम**, but**लोम**only. **महति—**Respected. Unlike the bee which is selfish,the wind wafts over the lotus-plant only to minister to thedelight of others.

 The metre is गीति

 There are men and men. One should never judge all by the same standard.

 Vs. 18**.—मौनं उप या—**To close down. cf. **मौनं मुच्**in verse 3above. **वदान्य—**Generous. **सादरम्**—Respectfully. **आदरेण सहितंयथा स्यात् तथा तुरतरब**:—The celestial trees are the followingfive: **पञ्चैते देवतरवो मन्दारः पारिजातकः। संतानः कल्पवृक्षश्च पुंसि वा हरिचन्द्रम्॥अमर.** The metre is **उद्गीति, आयीशकलद्वितये विपरीतेपुनरिहोद्गीतिः।**

** **Vs. 19**.—द्विजिह्व :—**A serpent. The tongue of the serpentswas rent into two, it is mythologically believed, when theserpents licked the blades of darbha grass on which the pitcherfull of nectar was deposited by Garuḍa, despite the latter’swarning to them not to approach it. of. Mbh., Ādi. P.**सौपर्णीकाद्रवाख्यान.**

** **The second meaning of is a double–dealer—he whospeaks differently as the occasion suits him. The sandal tree,possessing as it does many goodqualities, is avoided by menthrough fear of the deadly serpents clinging to it. Yet thesandal tree bears these serpents–which shows how noble it is!

 The metre is **गीति.**

 How magnanimous good men are to shelter even thosedouble–dealers who attempt to bring them down in theestimation of the people! of **क्षुद्रेऽपि नूनं शरणं प्रपन्ने ममत्वमुचैः शिरसांसतिव।–**Kumar. 1. 12.

 Vs. 20.—**गाहित**—from **गाह्**1 A. to enter. **प्रपेदे**–3 pers. sing.Pass. Perf. of **पद्**with **प्र**, to acquire. The metre is **आयी.**

** **The idea is obvious: the stanza pays compliments to agood man who offers help to others. Rare, indeed, is such amagnanimous man.

 Vs. 21.—**अपनीतपरिमलान्तरकथे–अपनीता परिमलान्तरस्य (अन्यस्य परिमलस्य) कथा यस्मात् तस्मिन्.** Which is far and away more fragrantthan any other flower. **धन्योऽसि–**Said ironically. How absurd

and unbecoming it is for a bee who has enjoyed the juice ofcelestial flowers to think of transferring himself to anotherand, indeed, less fragrant flower! The metre is **आर्या**.

 The idea is the same as in verse 9 above.

 Vs. 22.―**तटिनी**―river, **विन्ध्यभुव** :―**विन्ध्याद्भूः (जन्म) यस्थाःसा विन्ध्यभूः तस्याः.** Whose source is in the Vindhya mountain.The Vindhya mountain is one of the **कुलपर्वत**sand thereforesacred. cf. **महेन्द्रो मलयः सह्यः शक्तिमानृक्षपर्वतः। विन्ध्यश्च पारियात्रश्च सप्तैतेकुलपर्वत॥ वि**. **पु**. The river flowing from the Vindhya has a nobleparentage. **रथ्या**―A street. The poet asks whether it is worthyof a river holy in itself and flowing from the sacred Vindhyato receive unto itself dirty street―water even while it (theriver) is drying up?The metre is **उपगीति. आर्यापरार्धतुल्ये दलद्वयेप्राहुरुपगीतम्।**

 One, born in a noble family and himself endowed, besideswith good qualities, should never stoop, even under adversecircumstances, so low as to live by unworthy means or helpproffered by unworthy men. The idea is broadly the same asthat of verse 2 above.

 Vs. 23.—**शुक**:―A thorn. **‘शूकोऽस्त्री लक्ष्णतीक्ष्णाग्रे’―अमर. बर्बुर―**The Babbool tree, known as **बाभुल** in Marathi and **बावल**inGujarati. The tree is all thorns with a sprinkling of tinyleaves on the branches. There is, as the poet puts it here, noattraction in the Babbool which may draw men into its vicinity: rather its thorns serve to turn them away!

 One must be free from positive defects and must be endowed with good qualities before one may expect to draw theattention of others. Get.nothing–but injury, is a propositionwhich none will countenance.

 Vs. 24―**गहनम्–**A forest. **कलः**―A sweet but, inarticulatesound; here, the cooing of the cuckoo.**‘मधुरास्फुटे कलः’―अमर.साजात्यम्-समाना जातिः सजातिः तस्या मावः साजात्यम्.** The stats of having

acommon genus :belonging to the same class. The crows,cruel by nature, consider the tongue-tied cuckoo to be one oftheir own kind, for they are misled by the identical colour andshape. The cuckoo’s warble, however, is distinct from that ofthe crow. Hence, the warning which the poet gives to thecuckoo. The metre is **गीति.**

 One should never display one’s good qualities before wickedmen, for that will only provoke them to persecution.

 Vs. 25.―**सुषमा**―Excellence. **‘सुषमा परमा शोभा’―अमर. जीवजातम्**All beings.**‘जातिर्जातंच सामान्यम्’―अमर. आर्ति :—**Trouble, distress. **भवानीतात**―The Himalaya mountain. **हिमानी**―Mass ofsnow. **‘हिमानी हिमसंहतिः’―अमर.** Formed from **हिम―आनुक्** according to **‘हिमारण्ययो महत्त्वे’.**Vārtika on **इन्द्र वरुण भव** etc. Pān. 4.10 49.

 People may have sufficient reason to wonder, if great menshelter those who are notorious for their oppressive and maleficent activities.

 V. 26.―**अवज्ञासी**:―2 pers. Sing. Aor. of **ज्ञा** with **अव**. Forthe dropping of the temporal augment see notes on Verse 7.**मा अवज्ञासी**:―Do not disregard. **दानम्**―The stream of the ichoremanating from the temples of elephants. **द्विपधुर्य**―The bestamong elephants. **धुर्य―धुरं वहति इति.**Formed from **धुर्+यत्**according to **‘धुरो यढ्ढकौ’**Pān. 4. 4. 77.

 The idea in this verse is the same as that in verses 5 and18; only there is a difference in setting. Read after these twoverses, this stanza appears, in spite of its own charm, rathermonotonous, and the idea certainly stale.

 Vs. 27.―**अमरतरु–कामस्य**―**अमराणां तरुः, तस्य कुसुमानां सौरभस्य सेवनेनसंपूर्णाः सकलाः कामा यस्य, तस्य सौरभ–सुरभेर्भावः,** Fragrance **सेवनम्―**Enjoyment. **पुष्पान्तरसेवा**―Enjoyment of otherflowers. **विडम्बना―**Absurdity, impropriety. cf. **इयं च तेऽन्या पुरता विडम्बना**etc. Kum.5.70

 The idea is, again, the same as in Vss. 9 & 20. Suchrepetitions of the same idea appear wearisome, though the

verses, read individually and independently, are charmingenough. These repetitions are only to be explained by the factthat the whole of this Vilāsa is a nosegay of charming &fragrant flowers culled at different times, and then boundtogether.

 Vs. 28.―**परपुष्टाः**―cuckoos; literally, nourished by others.It is believed that the young ones of cuckoos are reared bycrows who are deceived by the sameness of colour andappearance, until the young birds are discovered by the crowsthrough the difference in their notes. Hence the cuckoo isknown as **परपुष्टा**or**परभृता.** f. **प्रागन्तरिक्षगमनात्स्वमपत्यजातमन्यैर्द्विजैःपरभुताःखलुपोषयन्ति।** Śak. 5. 22. **विटपिन्**–A tree. **उपमा-**A standardof comparison; **उपमीयते अनया इति**.

 The idea is literally the same as that in verse 20 above.

 Vs. 29.—Construe : **नालाकार भीनमानौ निदाघे अस्य तरोः या पुष्टिःअल्पैरपि तोयैः भवतः करुणया व्यरचि सा विश्वतः बारां धारासारान् विकिरताप्रावृषेण्येन बारिन जनयितुं शक्या किम्। व्यरचि–**was arranged, managed.3pers, sing. Aor. pass. of **रच्**with **वि**. **प्रावृषेण्य–**Belonging to therainy season. **प्रावृषि भव प्रावृषेण्य।**formed according to **‘प्रावृष एण्यः’**Pān. 4. 3. 17. **वार्n–** Water. **धारासार―**A copious shower of rain.**‘धारासंपात आसारः’–अमर** of. **अयमपि पटुर्धारासारो न वाणपरंपरा।–**Vik. IV. I.**वि+कृ**6 conj.–to scatter. **विश्वत** :―In all places. The suffix **तस्**is used here in the sense of the Loc. of **प्रयुक्तमप्यस्त्रमितो वृथा स्यात्।**Ragh. II, 34 where–on Mallinātha remarks: **सार्वविभक्तिकस्तसि.**

** **The metre is **मन्दाक्रान्ता. मन्दाक्रान्ता जलधिषडगैम्भौ नतौ ताद् गुरू चेत्।**

** **Help however small, rendered in the nick of time is farmore effective than assistance lavishly offered when themoment of necessity is passed. The poet has a fling at thepatrons who would help-but not in time of need. Comparethe words, and note the biting sarcasm, of Dr. Johnson in hisfamous letter to Lord Chesterfield- “Is not the patron, mylord, one who looks with unconcern on a man struggling forlife in the water, and, when he has reached ground, encumbershim with help?”

 Vs. 30.—**विवेक विकलः–**Indiscriminate, lit, lacking the discriminating faculty. **नृनम्–**Surely. **‘नूनं नर्केऽर्थनिश्चये’–अमर.रसा–**Theearth. **नीरसा–निर्गतः रसः यस्याः सा.** Moistureless, dry. **वात्या–**Awhirl–wind. **धन्वन्–**A barren piece of land desert. **अमृत–**Water**‘पयः कीलालममृतम्’–अमर कुतोऽप्याविष्कृतो बेधसा–**of : **दीपादन्यस्मादपि मध्यादपि जलनिधेर्दिशोऽप्यन्नात्। आनीय झटिति घटयति विधिरभिमतमभिमुखीभूतः॥**Rat. 1.

 The metre is **शार्दूलविक्रीडितम्.**

 The worst conspiracy of circumstances against one maybe set at naught, and the individual rescued, by the DivineDisposer. Contrast this verse with verse 3 above.

 Note how one and the same fact offers a variety of approachto a thinking mind.

** **The metre is **शार्दूलविक्रीडितम्.**

 The poet expresses the dilemma: whether to praise a greatman for his good qualities, or to despise him for his bad traits,both of which e, like all others, possesses. Preference toeither would betray partiality or prejudice; overlooking oraccepting both only shelves, not solves, the question. A knottyproblem indeed! (though, it must be admitted, very few wilfail to make up their minds in practice).

 Men should beware of things which have ruined even great men. Fools shouldn’t rush in where angels fear to tread.

 Vs. 59. **स्तन्यम्—**Milk. **स्तने भवम्. ‘शरीरावयवाच्च’**(Pān 4, 3.55) **इति यत् दृगन्तान् आ+धा—**To direct the eyes, to look about.**अयं धीरं धीरं** etc.—The cub hears the deep thunder of the cloud and, believing it to be the gurgling of an elephant, feels restive. The lioness sets her young one’s mind at rest.

 The metre is **शिखरिणी.**

 Qualities do not depend upon accidents like age, etc. They are, if at all, in the blood. Cf**. सिंहः शिशुरपि निपतति मदमलिनकपोलभित्तिषु गजेषु। प्रकृतिरियं सत्त्ववनां न खलु वयस्नेजसो हेतुः॥** Bhar. 1.38.

 Vs. 60.**—मासिक–**A month old. **‘कालादृञ्’**(Pān. 4. 3.11)**इति ठञ् (इक). मध्येजठरम्**—Inside the womb. **जटरस्यमध्ये मध्येजठरम्.**This Adv. Comp. is formed according to **‘पारे मध्ये षष्ठ्या वा’** Pān 2. 1. 18. Even though the foetus in the womb of the lioness is only a month old, yet the poet says—with exaggeration, of course—that it is conscious of its enmity with elephants. The idea is the same as in the preceding stanza.

 Vs. 61.—**वेतण्ड…पन्थिना—वेतण्डानो(गजानां) गण्डाः, नेषां कण्डूतौ (ग्वर्जने) यत्पाण्डित्यं तस्मिन्परिपन्थी, तेन।**Who is a rival in the skill of scratching the itch on the temples of elephants. The idea seems to be this: The olephants know how to scratch the itch (cf.**कण्डूयमानेन कटं कदाचित्** etc. Ragh. 2. 37 or, **माद्यत्कुञ्जरगण्डभित्तिकषणैर्भग्नस्रवच्चन्दनः।** Nāg. 1. 8); but the lion also knows that.

 Vs. 62.**—जनिः—**Birth. **मधुरता—**Exquisite beauty, the sweetness of appearance. The beauty of the lotus–flower rivals with that of the face of a pretty woman.**अच्युतराय**attempts to explain **मधुरता रामामुखस्पर्धिनी** in another way also:**तब मधुरता जहत्स्वार्थया गङ्गायां घोषः इत्यादिवत्त्वन्मधुमाधुरीत्यर्थः।** **रामेति। यावत्स्त्रीगुणा या रमणी तस्या यन्मुखं निरुक्तलक्षणया तदेकदेशोऽधरस्तर्त्स्पर्धनी स्वाधिक्येन तद्विरोधिनीत्यर्थः।**The first two lines are almost an echo of the first two lines of verse 39. **महाकविगिरां सर्वस्वम्—**The ‘every thing’of the speech of great poets. All these facts make the poets seize on you (the lotus flower) as the subject of their speech. **कामस्य च**—And you are the best possession of the god of love.

cherish affection. **मधुप—मधु पिवति इति.** It means (i) the bee, or (ii) one who drinks wine, hence a vicious man.

 The metre is **शार्दूलविक्रीडितम्.**

 Meritorious persons should not conceive friendship or relation with wicked men. It is beneath them.

 Vs. 63.**—लीलामुकुलितनयनम–लीलया मुकुलिते नयने यथा स्यातां तथा।**Adv. comp. with eyes playfully closed. The elephant who is at eternal enmity with the eventually ferocious lion, is starkly foolish to ignore his own perilous condition & sleep comfortably. cf. **विधाय वैरं सामर्षे नरोऽरौ य उदासते। कक्षे दावानलं क्षिप्त्वा शेरतेतेऽभिमारुतम्॥**

 Having contracted enmity with a powerful enemy,one cannot afford to be negligent.

 The metre is **शार्दूलविक्रीडितम्.**

 It is good to be generous; but better to be generous to those who deserve. See notes on verse 35.

The hunter is not alone in the world

to slay trusting animals; there is many a villain moving about royal palaces, or holy places hatching his evil designs to harass good men. cf. **मृगमीनसज्जनानां तृणजलसंतोषविहितवृत्तीनाम्। लुब्धकधीजरपिशुना निष्कारणवैरिणो जगति॥**Bhar. I. 61.

** **The poet complains that the earth–mark the word used.**काश्यपी—**is indiscriminate for she bears the good and the wicked alike. A discreet man should treat others as they deserve.

meant ‘pungent.’Compare the Ayurvedic term **त्रिकटु**whichmeans **शुण्ठी, पीपर** & **मरिच.** While **तिक्त**meant ‘bitter,’e. g. thetaste of a green nim-fruit. In course of time the two words.came to have their meanings interchanged. Now, saffron isbitter in taste i. e. **तिक्त**(in its original sense); and it is thisbitterness which is meant by the word **कटुता.**

** **The metre is **वसन्ततिलका.**

** **For the idea of the verse, compare the Vernacular saying‘Even a kick by a milch-cow may be borne with good grace’.

The poet triesto bring into bold relief the vast difference between men ofgenius and mere smatterers: (i) men of genius easily masterany department of knowledge, while the smatterer has to toileven to get at it. (ii) geniuses forcibly acquire possession oflearning: the smatterers only slyly gather up whatever theycan lay hands on. Theirs, therefore, is a dubious possession(iii) The man of genius storms the city of knowledge; thesmatterer, on the other hand, approaches a mere house. **वल्ग** 1P-To go, to dance, **अद्यश्वः—**Any day. **मूर्धुसुपदं धा–**To plant one'sfoot on the head of another.

Is it not a ridiculous idea that the fox could baffle the lion,or that hares could overpower elephants, or that fledgelingscould suppress serpents? Well, equally ridiculous is the sightof upstarts parading their little knowledge in front of mastere.of Learning, ef. verse 44 above. Bhartṛhari has already laid

down the plain but golden rule for thom: **विशेषतः सर्वविदांसमाजेविभूषणं मौनमपण्डितानाम्।**

 Vs. 72. **—परुष–**Harsh. **अलब्धशाणोत्कषणाः—न लब्धं शाणे उत्कषणंयैस्ते.** which are not whetted on the whet–stone. The diamond isprimarily a rough–hewn dug–out stone; when it is whetted onthe whet–stone, it attains to its proper lustre and shape, andbecomes fit for ase in the coronets of kings. **अलब्धशाणो** etc.**—**of.**मणिःशाणोल्लीढः** etc. Bhar. 1. 44.

The various views aboutthese spots are summed up in the following stanza : **अङ्कं केऽपिशशङ्किरे जलनिधेः पङ्कं परे मेनिरे सारङ्गं कतिचिच्च संजगदिरे भूच्छायमैच्छन् परे।इन्दौ यद्दलितेन्द्रनीलशकलश्यामं दरीदृश्यते तत्सान्द्रं निशि पतिमन्धतमसं कुक्षिस्थमाचक्ष्महे॥. पिशुनजन—**The wicked.

 Vs. 77.**—विसृज्यते—**Is avoided.**अपायशङ्किभिः—अपायं शङ्कितुंशीलं येषां तैः—**Those who fear danger.**आशीविषः—आशिषि विषं यस्यसः—**A serpent.

 Vs. 78.—This stanza is a good illustration of **समासोक्ति,** forthe same details are open to two different interpretations, oneof them being technical. First we take the ordinary meanings:**परार्थव्यासङ्ग—परस्मै अयं परार्थश्चासौ व्यासङ्गः.** Work for the sake ofothers. **उपजहत्—**Nom. sing. of pres. part. masc. of **हा** with **उप,**to abandon. The first pāda means: He who overlocks his owninterests and works for the welfare of others. Bhartṛhariwould agree with Jagannātha in calling such a man & **सत्पुरुष.**of. **एते सत्पुरुषाः परार्थघटकाः स्वार्थान्परित्यज्य ये।**Bhart. I. **अभेदैकरत्वम्—नविद्यतेभेदः यस्मिन् तत्, तथाभूतं एकत्वम्.** Unity which knows no difference.Phenomenal plurality is a matter of experience, yet the wiseman recognizes the fundamental unity of all.Cf. **तथाहि समुद्रादुकात्मनोऽनन्यत्वेऽपि तद्विकाराणां फेनवीचितरङ्गबुद्बुदादीनामितरेतर-विभाग इतरेतरसंश्लेषादिलक्षणश्च व्यवहारउपलभ्यते। न च समुद्रादु-कात्मनोऽनन्यत्वेऽपि तद्विकाराणांफेनतरङ्गादीनामितरेतरभावापत्तिर्भवति। नच तेषामितरेतरभावानापत्तावपि समुद्रात्मनोऽन्यत्वं भवति :** Śānkara Bhāṣya on B. S. 2. 1. 13 **गुणभूतेषु—**May be dissolved in two ways : (i) **गुणानां विकाराः गुणमयानि, गुणभयानि च तानि भूतानि गुणभूतानि।** or (ii) **गुणेभ्यः भूतानि (उद्भूतानि) वस्तूनि।.**

The sense remains the same in both of these. **गुणभुतानि**means**^(८)**beings[^11] born of Guņas’. Here there is a reference to **सत्त्व, रजस्**and **तमस्**, the three **गुणऽ** forming Prakriti**—**from which theuniverse is evolved. The idea of the second āda is : the goodman realizes that behind the apparent differences in thethings of the world, they are homogeneous and (metaphysicallyspeaking) identical. **ललित—**Charming.**उदात्तमहिमा—**The variantis **दातृमहिमा—**Greatness peculiar to a generous man.

[^11]: "‘सप्तमीविशेषणे बहुव्रीहौ’—Pān. 2. 2. 35."

 The second meaning refers to the Bahuvrīhi compound ingrammar and describes its various essential aspects from &technical point of view. etc**.—**The Bahuvrīhi compoundis formed in order to denote something not expressed by thewords forming the compound Of. **‘अनेकमन्यपदार्थे’—**Pān. 2. 2.94 and the gloss on **‘अन्यपदार्थे’**given in the **तत्त्वबोधिनीः समस्यमानपदातिरिक्तस्य पदस्यार्थेइत्यर्थः॥** In the case of a Dvandva Comp. boththe members are equally prominent **(प्रधान)**; in a Tatp. thesecond member is prominent, the first being only an appendage**(उपसर्जन)**. In the Bah. Comp., on the other hand, neither ofthem is prominent, for the comp. being adjectival in character,qualifies and refers to a substantive not contained inthe comp.itself. For instance the comp. **शतपत्रम्**consists oftwo words **शत**and **पत्र**. But the comp. **शतपत्र**does not denoteeither of these two **पदऽ** but something else which has got ahundred petals : **शतं पत्राणि यस्य तत् कमलम्.** Hence the Bahu. comp.subordinates its own meaning **(स्वार्थ)** and refers to somethingelse **(परार्थ). अभैदैकत्वं**etc.—It is necessary for the formation ofa Bhu. comp. that its members agree with each other in theircases when dissolved i. e. they must be **समानाधिकरण.** Cf. **अप्रथमाविभक्त्यर्थे बहुव्रीहिरिति समानाधिकरणानामिति फलितम्।**Sid. Kau. Forinstance, **प्राप्तमुदकं यं प्राप्तादको ग्रामः। ऊढो रथो येन स ऊढरथोऽनड्वान्**etc. In these instances the subordinate words **(गुणभूतऽ)**

** व्याधिकरण** Bahuvrihi is allowed only in the Gen. & Loc. Gases.**^(८)‘सप्तमीविशेषणे बहुव्रीहौ’—**Pān. 2. 2. 35.

viz. **प्रातं उदकम्, ऊढः रथः** forming the Bahu. Comp. arein the same case. Hence the poet says in the secondpāda, ‘which continuously possesses a unity (of meaning)without difference (in the **विभक्तिऽ** of the words) in the membersforming the compound **(गुरुभूतेषु)’**. Better than this, however.is the following interpretation: **अभेदैकत्व** means the state ofunity in which all individualities are sublated. Just as variouskinds of herbal juices which go to make up honey lose theirindividualities and give only one, that of **मधु**[^12]similarly inthe Bahu. Comp. its various members submerge their individualities. stand as a composite whole & denote only onething. **स्वभावाद्** etc. **—उदात्त** means the **उदात्त** accent. There arethree accents found in the Vedas, **उदात्त** (High), **अनुदात्त**(Low)& **स्वरित**(Sounded). There are detailed rules governing thepositions of these accents in a word, New, according to theSūtra,**‘बहुव्रीहौ प्रकृत्या पूर्वपदम्’.—**Pán. 6. 2. 1, in a Bahu. Comp.the first member retains its own natural accents i. e., the **उदात्त**accent in the whole compound word will be in the natural**(स्वभावात्)**position within the first member. The third pādatherefore means,‘in which the charming and important **उदात्त**accent shines naturally (in its natural place)’.—Pāninilays down that compounds can be formed of **समर्थ**(competent)words only.**‘समर्थः पदविधिः’** Pān. 2. 1. 1. Hence the Bahu.Comp. must have ‘competency’. Or **समर्थ** means, able toexpress thesense of unity without distinction **(अभेदैकत्व).सामर्थ्यमप्येकार्थीभावबोधकतारूपं तत्रैवोक्तम्।** B. G., p. 284.

only the particular associations or connections of a man thatmake him honoured irrespectively of his noble birth or personalattainments. Extraneous circumstances more than hisqualities help to make a man what he is. *cf.* **प्रायेणाधममध्यमोत्तमगुणाः संसर्गतोदेहिनाम्।**Bhart.

See notes on verse 37. Note the contrastin the contents of this stanza and stanza 70.

The differences & distinctions of phenomenal existence are therefore unreal, and misleading. Hence**द्वैत**(Duality) is called ‘darkness’because it does not reallyexist. **किं शास्त्रम्** etc.—The real Śāstra is that which dispels thedarkness of ‘Duality’and enables one to realize the**सर्वात्मभाव.तत्त्वाववोध—**Knowledge of facts. Facts can never be altered; hencetheir knowledge would spare many troubles which onewould otherwise experience.

 The metre is **वसन्ततिलका.**

 One should have nothing to do with a wicked man. For,like deadly poison, or fire, or a cobra he only harms him whotries to lead him on the way of good men. Here the poetrefers to the dangers involved in, and not the impossibility of,bringing a villain round. Bhartṛhari dwells upon he latterin the verse : **व्यालं बालमृणालतन्तुभिरसौ रोद्धुं समुज्जृम्भतेछेत्तुं वज्रमणीञ्छिरीषकुसुमप्रान्तेन सह्यते। माधुर्ये मधुबिन्दुना रचयितुं क्षाराम्बुधेरीहते नेतुंवाञ्छति यः खलान्पथि सतां सूक्तैः सुधास्यन्दिभिः॥ 1. 6.**

 Vs. 96.**—उर्वी—**The earth. **जगदण्ड—**The cosmic egg, theuniverse. cf. the word **ब्रह्माण्ड.** The universe is called **अण्ड** becauseit developed into the form of an egg when God applied himselfto the work of creation. of. **तदण्डमभवद्धैमं सहस्रांशुसमप्रबम्।**Manu. 1.9.**प्रलय**—Lit.

Jagannātha himselfexplains: **बीजाकरणं बीजप्रक्षेणपूर्वकं कर्षणम्।** R. G. **सत्कारं चर्—**To trestwell, to behave courteously. He who attempts to behave wellwith a villain (with the desire of correcting him) may as welltry to plough the sky with seeds, or draw pictures on wind(as canvas), or mark out lines on the surface of water!

Thefollowing are the variants for the four pādas: (a)**कुरुते** or **शम्बां कुरुते,** (b) **यत्नतः सलिले** in place of **सुन्दरं पवने,** (९) **स्नपयति पवनं सलिलैः,** (d) **यः क्षुद्रे** in place of **यस्तु खले.**

** **Vs. 98.—If a necklace is offered to a monkey, he willeither lick it and smell out of curiosity, or finally will decidethat it will be a nice elevated seat for him, when eoiledup! Never throw pearls before swine.

 Vs. 99.—Apparently, the verse is addressed to a bee thatleaves a lotus-plant. But really the poet addresses a fickle

lover whom the beloved **(नायिका)** warmly loves in spite of hismany defects. Therefore the various adjectives admit of twomeanings. **मलिन—**(i) The bee is ‘dirty’; (ii) the lover is **दूषित—**Guilty (in love).**रागपूर्णा—**(i) The lotus-plant is ‘full of redcolour’; (ii) the beloved is ‘full of love’. **विकसितवदना—**(i)Whose face has opened.

(ii) The lover is a prattler: he ‘protesteth too much’.**चपल—**Fickle, unsteady-equally applicableto both. **सरसा—**(i) **रस–**juice. The lotus-plant is full of ‘juice’for the bee.

Mark the contrast between **स्वास्यं**and**सकलं—**The cloud is entirely darkened, though he gets waterfor others. Men have their faces only paling when beggingfor their own selves, though their case is worse than that ofthe cloud. It is very trying to beg from another—for thesake of some one else; how much more so when one has to begfor one’s own self? This verse explains why the poet envied(!) the good luck of trees in verse 88 above.

 The metre is **वसन्ततिलका.**

 Vs. 101.**—सानुविशेषः—**Some peak of the mountain **मलय.**The poet thereby emphasises that the family of sandal wasnot exalted or renowned. **जातिः—**Class, genus.

 Good qualities shall command recognition, and earn ahigh position. cf. **पदं हि सर्वत्र गुणैर्निधीयते।** Ragh. 3. 62.

 Kaliyuga flourishes through the charming objects in theworld, which captivate the hearts of men. Every one likes topossess the good things of the world, but one should recognizethe real effects of such possessions on their own selves. If theworldly objects were to cease capturing the human beings,then from that moment Kali will begin to langaish–it will bea return to **कृतयुत**indeed!

On which beesare sweetly buzzing. **मधौ–मधु**means Spring.The mango–treeis the cuckoo's cherished resort in spring. In the absence ofthe mango–tree, therefore, the Cuckoo was overwhelmed withsorrow.

 The metre is **प्रमिताक्षरा प्रमिताक्षरा सजससैःकथिता।**

 Vs. 107.**—विदुषमग्र**can be taken in two ways in the context:(i) **विदुषामग्रे तव चरितम्.** How thou behavest (and that is mostmeanly, of course) before learned men. (ii) **विदुषामग्रे विविच्यवक्ष्यामि. विविच्य—**Having analysed, in detail.

 Vs. 108.—This verse resembles verse 87 above in theform of contents. **आनन्दमृगदावाग्निः—**Just as the forest fire**(दावाग्नि)** scares away–or even destroys-the deer, so also doesthe company of the wicked spell the end of all pleasantness.**शीलशाखिमदद्विपः—शीलं एव शाखी (तरुः), तस्य (तंप्रति) मदद्विपः।** Theintoxcated elephant to the tree of ‘good conduct’. Goodconduct ends when the company of the wicked begins. cf.**दौर्मन्त्र्यान्नृपतिर्विनश्यति यतिः सङ्गात्सुतो लालनाद् विप्रोऽनध्ययनात्कुलं कुतनयाच्छीलंखलोपासनात्।**etc. Bhart. 1. 42. **ज्ञानदीपमहावायुः—**Just as a fiercelyblowing wind puts out the lamp, so also the company of thewicked extinguishes the lamp of knowledge.

 Vs. 110. **—विनिवेशिता—**Placed. **रसनामिषेण–रसनायाः मिषेण.** Inthe guise of a tongue. The poet supposes that the tongue in

the mouth of the wicked is really a she–serpent; for, those whom their tongue bites never survive.**न जिवन्ति—**Do not survive; People bitten by the tongue of the wicked are ruined; their good name as well as every trait of charecter they prize most is lost. Cf. **जाडयं ह्रीमनि गण्यते** etc.Bhart. 1. 49. **अमन्त्राः—**Ordinary serpents can be overpowered, or their poison neutralized, by the aid of charms. But this she–serpent in the mouth of the wicked is so uncommonly deadly that there are no charms to restrain her or neutralize her poison

 The poet here refers to the habit of wicked men of backbiting and censuring others. (Bharthari refers to the **दुर्जनऽ**as**आक्षेपरूक्षाक्षग्मुखरमुखाः**1. 79) Their victims are sure to suffer on account of this unremitting propaganda against them. of.**अहो खलभुजङ्गस्य विचित्रोऽयं अधक्रमः। अन्यस्य दर्शन श्रोत्रमन्यः प्राणैर्वियुज्यते॥**

** **The mstre is **मालभारिणी. विषमे सहजे नगे नगे नाविषमस्त्र्येण तु मालभारिणीयम्।**

** **Vs. 111.—The poet new appropriately winds up his tribute (1) to a **खल** with a vote of ‘thanks’In this verse, he refers to some action on the part of the **खल. उन्नत–**High, Noble. There is bitter irony in the whole of this verse. The poet apparently compliments and thanks the wicked man, but he really means to say, “What a wicked dead thou hast done! Thou hast thereby earned only infamy. And we shall be cursing thee as long as we live.”Cf. **उपकृतं बहु तत्र किमुच्यते सुजनता प्रथिता भवता परम्। विदधदीदृशमेव सदा सखे सुखितमास्स्व ततः शरदां शतम्॥ (बहुभिरपकारैस्ताप्यमानस्योक्तिरियम्। शब्दव्यापारविचार)**

** **Vs. 112**—अविरतम्—**Adv. Comp. Incessantly.**विमलशारद** etc.–The light of the clear autumnal moon. In autumn the moon shines at her best for the sky is ideally clear at the time. Fame must be spotless i. e. white without any blot. Hence fame is often compared with moonlight on account of its whiteness–and pleasantness as well.**चन्दिर—**The moon; derived from the rt. **चन्द्** to be glad, to shine (K. G.)

 The metre is **द्रुतविलंवित. द्रुतविलंवितमाह नभौ भरौ.**

 The good always work for others; their words are sweet. they are broad–minded, and their fame is pleasant and unimpeachable.

 Vs. 113. **—एत्य—**Gerund of **आ + इ** to go. **कुसुमाकरः—**The vernal season.**चिरं मग्नाम्—**Which is lost long since. The cuckoo does not feel inspired to coo out his sweet notes except in spring.**समधायि—**3rd per. sing. Aor. pass. of **सम्+धा**to fasten. **हृदये संधा—**To aim at the the heart. **शौभिक—**A hunter.

For the same idea expressed under different circumstances see verses 57 and the verse quoted in the notes on it.

 Vs. 114,**—विपुलाडम्बरः—**Very showy, pompously decorated. **आपात–**Appearance.

 The want of intrinsic worth can never be adequately made up for by external get–up however pompous. A fool will remain a fool, however much he may try to look otherwise.

 Ve. 117.—The stanza, apparently addressed to a bee settling on **सरजस्का केतकी,** hints at the man who indulges in intercourse with a woman in menstruation. **सरजस्का—**(i) **रजस्** means the pollens in flowers. Hence,**सरजस्का** means ‘having

pollens’. (ii) she who is in menstruation. **रजस्**here means ‘the menstrual flow’. Sexual conjugation with a woman in her menstrual period is forbidden both by the Ayurveda and the Dharmasāstras. cf. Manu. 3. 47. **पाण्डुवर्णा—**(i) grey in colour. **केतकी** is grey in colour. (ii) pale in colour. **कण्टकप्रकरान्विता—**(i) the **केतकि** is ‘thickly studded with thorns.’(ii) **कण्टक** means bristling of hair, **रोमहर्ष**.Paling of colour and horripilations are indications of the spontaneous manifestation of love **(सात्त्विक भावऽ). स्तम्भप्रलयरोमाञ्चाः स्वेदो वैवर्ण्यवेपथू।**etc. D.

Bees play about the moon–lotuses which open out at the sight of the moon. In the second half of the stanza there is also a hint that even queens pander with drunkards.

 Vs. 126.**—उच्छृंखलः—**Unrestrained, Wayward. Fate is capricious and unprincipled, for he does not give you when you ask, but gives when you don't.

An Aluk samāsa. cf.**मध्येजठरम्** in Verse 64 notes. **वल्गद्गाण्डिव** etc**.—वल्गत् (टंकारं कुर्वत्) यद् गाण्डिवं तस्मान्मुत्काश्चने काण्डाः (इषवः), तेषां वलयैः (ओधैः), ज्वालानां आवल्यः (ममूहाः) तासां ताण्डवेन च भ्रश्यत् (विनाश्यमानम्) खाण्डवम्, तस्मिन् रुष्टं पाण्डवम्।**Pāṇḍva i Arjuna who was highly enraged, in the Khāṇḍava forest which was at the time being consumed by the ravages of the mass of flames and by the barrage of arrows discharged from the twanging Gāṇḍiva bow. Once the Fire–god became constipated with ghee on account of the incessant sacrificial activities of king Maruta. So he approached Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa for help so that he may devour the Khāṇḍava forest (which belonged to Indra. the god of rain) and thus digest the ghee jamming up his belly.**अर्जुन** and **कृष्ण**consent to help him; and then Arjuna with a continuous discharge of arrows, and Kṛṣṇa with his discus guarded the boundaries of the forest so that none may escape, while the Fire–god ravaged wildly

in the forest. cf. Mahābhārata, Vanaparvan, sub–parvar **खाण्डवदाहपर्वन्. क्षितीशः—**Voc. would be a better reading.

 The metre is **शार्दूलविक्रीडितम्.**

 Vs. 128.**—खण्डितानेत्र** etc.**–खण्डितानां नेत्राण्येव कञ्जानि (पद्मानि), तेषां आलीनां मञ्जुरञ्जने (मधुरप्रसादनकर्मणि) पण्डिताः।** Expert in sweetly pleasing (or opening) the clusters of lotuses in the form of the eyes of women supplanted in love. **पद्मऽ** open out when the sun rises, cf. **पद्माकरं दिनकरो विकचीकरोति।**Bhar. 1-74. The woman who is ingnored by her husband and who burns with jealousy because he bestows his affections on another woman of his heart is called **खण्डिता.**cf.**ज्ञातेऽन्यासङ्गविकृते खण्डितेर्ष्याकषायिता।** D. R. 2-25.Such a woman rejoices at the rise of the sun for her faithless husband who has been spending the night in the company of his ‘lass’ will be separated from his beloved for the day. Therefore the eyes of the **खण्डिता**woman beam with delight at the rise of the sun. **मण्डिताखिलदिक्प्रान्ता.:—मण्डिताः अखिलाः दिक्प्रान्ताः यैः।** Which have brightened up (lit.decorated) all the ends of the quarters. **भानवः—**Rays.

**SĀNTAVILASA.**

** शान्तविलास—**Like the two Vilāsas which immediately precede it**—श्रृङ्गारविलास** and **करुणविलास,** this Vilāsa too derives its name after one of the Rasas, though it is to be noted that **शान्त**is not admitted as an independent Rasa by all schools of Sanskrit rhetoricians. Like the other two, again, the title of this vilāsa serves as an index of the sentiment prevailing throughout most of the verses comprising it.

** शान्तरस** is the sentiment of Quietism. When the battles of life have been waged and their stark horrible nakedness is perceived, and when, consequently, the dust and the rear of the Battle. so inviting and irresistible at other times, lose their appeal, the mind, becoming tired of worldly pursuits and the arge of senses, becomes chastened; a tranquil mood supervenes; and one yearns to rise above the Babel and escape into that Full Life which is all tranquillity. Thus the sentiment of Quietism—of the peace of mind—induces in the end an atmosphere as placid and untroubled as some forest retreat, untrod by man, where the morning sun shines over the softly bubbling water of the stream. In this Vilasa, the poet depicts a frame of mind to which worldly pleasures appear to be so many fetters, sense—organs so many hoops, life beset with its untold worries an oppression—the whole world a horrible nightmare. To such an harassed soul the poet points out the way of escape from misery, Viz., the worship of Śrī Kṛṣṇa who being identical with the highest Divinity is certain to rescue the miserable and worried refugee from his difficulties. In most of the stanzas of this vilāsa, therefore, in spite of the varied approaches to the theme, there is but one refrain, and that is the advice to all to dedicate their lives at the feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. And Jagannātha, like a devout Vaiṣṇava, waxes passionately devotional in his reverential references to, or descriptions of, that fascinating divinity-ŚrīKṛṣṇa.

 Vs. 1**.—विशाल…विकलितम्–विशालं च तद् विषयाटवीवलयम्, तस्मिन् लग्नो यो दावानलस्तस्य प्रसृत्वराः(प्रसरणशीलाः) शिखाः, तासां आवलीभिः विकलिनम्। विषयाः—विशेषेण सिन्वन्तीति विषयाः**Those that fetter the mind and the soul more and more i. e. worldly pleasures or objects.**अटविवलम्–**forest region. Worldly pleasures are fraught with as many dangers as a forest region is. For, from the philosophical point of view, they try to prevent the soul from realizing its own true nature; and until the soul realizes the truth it will have perforce to journey on in the Sansāra. Hence the **विषयऽ** are spoken of as a ‘forest–region.’**दावानल–**a conflagration. It stands for the desires to enjoy’.**कामऽ**are often compared with fire**.प्रसृत्वर–**spreading. Formed from **प्र+सृ** by the addition of the termination**क्वरप्.** The idea of the first two lines: The numberless worldly pleasures inflame the desires **(कामऽ).** These desires even when satisfied do not die down, but, on the contrary, continue to grow. In the end, the mind becomes confused on account of its being tossed hither and thither by ceaseless desires. **अमन्दमिलदिन्दिरे–अमन्दा मिलन्ती च इन्दिरा (शोभा) यस्य तस्मिन्. माधुरी–मधुरस्यभावः**The face of Śrīkrsna is invitingly beautiful. **चन्दिर=चन्द्र,** derived from the rt. **चन्द्**to delight. **चकोरायतान्–**3 pers. sing. Imperative of the denominative verb from **चकोर, चकोराय्–**To behave like a cakora.**चकोर इवआचरति. ‘कर्तुः क्यङ् सलोपश्च’**(Pān. 8 1. 11) **इति क्यङ्**. Just as the cakora pines for, and gazes steadfastly at, the sight of the moon, so let my mind earnestly concentrate itself in the devotion of Mukunda.

 The metre is **पृथ्वी.**

 Vs. 2**.—जलधिनन्दिनी** etc.**—जलधिनन्दिन्याः(लक्ष्म्याः) नयने नीरजे इव, तयोःआलम्बन।** Laxmīfondly gazes at her lord **विष्णु** i. e.**कृष्ण.**Viṣņuis the resting–place of the eyes of Laxmī. Laxmīis called **जलधिनन्दिनी** because along with the moon, the **कौस्तुभमणि,**the **ऐरावत** and others, she was born from the **क्षीरसमूद्र**when it was churned by the gods & the demons.**ज्वलज्ज्वलन**etc.—**ज्वलन् यो ज्वलनः(अग्निः) स इव जित्वरः (जयशीलः) यो ज्वरभरः तस्य त्वरया**

**(वेगेन) भङ्गुरम्. जित्वर—**Winning. Formed like **प्रसृत्वर** in stanza 1.**ज्वर—**Worldly oppression. The world and its objects are not what they appear to be. They are illusory. To a thinking mind directed towards salvation the worldly existence is an oppression because it is not the reality. The only reality is Brahman–One without a second. For **ज्वर** cf.**‘अतोऽन्यदार्तम्’।**Bri. Up. 3-5 **‘मृत्योः स मृत्युमाप्नोति य इह नानेव पश्यति’।** Kāthak. 2-1-10.**त्वरा—**Force, impetuosity. **प्रभातजलज**etc.**—प्रभातस्य जलजानां उन्ननन् गरिमगर्वः (गुरुताया गर्वः), नस्य सर्व कषन्तीति।** Which destroy the pride of beauty of the morning lotuses. For a parallel idea compare **यन्मां न भामिनि निभालयसि प्रभातनीलारविन्दमदमङ्गिमदैः कटाक्षैः।**Bham, 3-4 **जगत्रितयरोचनैः—जगतां त्रितयस्य रोचनैः—**Pleasing the three worlds. **त्रितयम्—त्रयोऽवयवा यस्य तत्। ‘संख्याया अवयवे तयप्’**(Pān, 5-2-42) **इति तयप्. शिशिरय्—**To cool.

 Vs. 3.—In this verse Kṛṣṇa is spoken of as a mass of clouds **(कादम्बिनी).** The poet tries to show the distinguishing characteristics of this uncommon mass of clouds, which make it superior to the ordidary clouds.**कादम्बिनी—**Lit., amass of clouds. **‘कादम्बिनी मेघमाला’—अमर.** Kṛṣṇais identifed with a mass of clouds because, like the latter, he is glossy and dark in complexion. of **जयतु जयतु मेघश्यामलः कोमलाङ्गो जयतु जयतु पृथ्वीभारनाशो मुकुन्दः॥**Kālidāsa too. apart from the aptness of the Rūpaka, has, it must be supposed, called**कृष्ण** a मेघfor this very reason : **कृष्णमेघस्तिरोदधे।** Ragh. 10-48. **स्मृतापे—स्मृतमात्रा. तरुणातपं हरन्ती** ete.—Ordinary clouds can relieve the growing sunshine only while they are present in the sky. But Kṛṣṇa destroys worldly cares even while he is only contemplated by men.**अभङ्गुतनुत्विषाम्—अभङगुराः तनूनांस्त्विषः यासां तासाम्। वलयिता—**Surrounded. Formed from **वलय + इतच्** according to **‘तदस्य संजातं तारकादिभ्य इतच्’।** Pán. 5–2–36 **विद्युताम्—**In connection with **कृष्ण** the ‘lightings’stand for the Gopīs whose complexion was lustrous and non-momentary **(अभङ्गुर).** The ordinary **कादम्बिनी** is surrounded by hundreds of lightnings whose flashes are perishable and short-lived **(तनु);** but **कृष्ण** is surrounded by ‘lightnings’

(Gopīs) whose complexion is shiny and enduring. For a parallel idea vide Ragh. 6-65. **कलिन्दनगनन्दिनी—**The river Jumna, for it flows from the mountain. **कलिन्द** She is also called **कालिन्दी. सुरद्रुमालम्बिनी—सुरद्रुमान् आलम्बितुं शीलं यस्या सा.** Kṛṣṇa's favourite haunts were the rīchly verdured regions along the banks of the Jumna.**मतिचुम्विनी भवतु—**May the mind cotemplate. For the last two lines cf. **अस्माकं तु तदेव लोचनचमत्काराय भूयाच्चिरं कालिन्दीषुलिनोदरे किमपि यन्नीलं महो धावति॥**

 Vs. 4—In this verse Kṛṣṇa is described as a Tamāla tree. **वनान्तरम्—**The interior, the inner recesses, of the forest. As Kṛṣṇa moved about, the interior of the forest became illuminated. **पथि गतागत श्रमभरम्—**The great exhaustion produced by com ing up and down the road of Sansāra cf. **पुनरपि जननं पुनरपि मरणं पुनरपि जननीजठरे शयनम्।**This line is applicable both to an ordinary Tamāla tree and to Kṛṣṇa. Just as the ordinary Tamāla tree relieves the fatigue of travellers on the road, Kṛṣṇa removes the distress of the souls that travel on the track of the Sansāra–i e. are born and reborn again and again. **लतावलिशतावृतः—**The ordinary Tamāla is entwined by hundreds of creepers; Kṛṣṇa is surrounded by hundreds of Gopīs. The woman is often compared with a creeper entwining a tree (i. e. her husband). **रूचा—**Instr. Sing. of **रूच्,** splendour. **श्रमान्—**The fatigue of phenomenal existence; or hardships in life.

 Vs. 5.—Kṛṣṇa is described as a cloud in this stanza. **जटिलय्—**To entangle, to indent. Denominative from .**जटिल. ज्योत्स्नामय—**Full of moon-light, i, e., as delightful as moonlight. The ordinary cloud showers fresh water, no doubt; but Kṛṣṇa showers the world with his pleasant nectar-like lustre, which is not seen anywhere else **(नव). त्रिविधः संतापः—**The threefold worries of the world: (i)**आधिभौतिक—**material worries–worries about the body and about worldly things. (ii) **आधिदैविक—**Worries that visit a man through supernatural agency. (iii) **आध्यात्मिक—**Psychological worries, like **काम, क्रोध** etc. The ordinary cloud can at best mitigate physical worries, but Kṛṣṇa

alleviates all the three types of them. **नतनिखिलवृन्दारकवृतः—नतैःनिखिलैः (सर्वैः) वृन्दारकैः(देवैः) वृतः।** cf. **इन्द्रादिदेवगणवन्दितपादपद्मं वृन्दावनालयमहं वसुदेवम् (वन्दे)।स्वान्तध्वान्तम्—**The darkness of the heart,the preponderance of **तमोगुण.** When the heart is clouded by the**तमम्,** the soul cannot realize the truth, for his vision is blurred.cf.**तमस्त्वज्ञानजं विद्धि मोहनं सर्वदेहिनाम्। प्रमादालस्यनिद्रामिस्तन्निबध्नाति भारत॥**Bh. G. 14-8. Or **ध्वान्त** may be interpreted as the Primal Ignorance **तिरय्—**To destroy. **नवीनः—**Extraordinary.

 Vs. 10.**—शिक्षा—**Advice. Here the poet refers to the **अन्तर्यमिन्** or ‘the inner voice’which is the voice of God. cf. **ईश्वरःसर्व भूतानां हृदेशेऽर्जुन तिष्ठति।**Bh. G. 18. This ‘Inner divinity’always guides or warns the individual to whom it is open toaccept this divine lead or not. cf. **एष ह्येव साधु कर्मकारयति तं यमेभ्योलोकेभ्य उन्निनीषत एष उपवासाधु कर्मकारयति तं यमधोनिनीषते।’**Kau. Br. 3-8.**केनापि देवेन हृदि स्थितेन यथा नियुक्तोऽस्मि तथा करोमि।** Or the reference maybe to the Vedas and other Revealed texts which are believedto be the words of God.

The **गणिका** then held out an invitation to **कृष्ण**and**वलराम**to visit her residence, which **कृष्ण** eventually honoured.Read : **अथ व्रजन्राजपथेन माधवः स्त्रियं गृहीताङ्गविलेपभाजनाम्। विलोक्य कुब्जांयुवतीं वराननां पप्रच्छ यान्तीं प्रहसन रसप्रदः॥१॥ का त्वं वरोर्देतदु हानुलेपनंकस्याङ्गने वा कथयस्व साधु नः। देह्यावयोरङ्गविलेपमुत्तमं श्रेयस्ततस्ते न चिराद्भविष्णति॥२॥ सैरन्ध्युवाच—दास्यम्यहं सुन्दर कंससंमता त्रिवक्रनामा ह्यनुलेपकर्मणि। मद्भावितं भोजपतेरनिप्रियं विना युवां कोऽन्यतमस्तदर्हति॥३॥ रूपपेशलमाधुर्यहसितालापवीक्षितैः। घर्षितात्मा ददौ सान्द्रमुभयोरनुलेपनम्॥४॥ ततस्तावङ्गरागेण स्वपर्णेतरशोभिना। संप्राप्तपरभागेन शुशुभानेऽनुरञ्जितौ॥५॥ प्रसन्नोभगवान् कुब्जां त्रिवक्रांरुचिराननाम्। ऋज्वीं कर्तुं मनश्चक्रे दर्शयन् दर्शने फलम्॥६॥पद्भ्यामाक्रम्य प्रपदे द्व्यङ्गुल्युत्तानपाणिना। प्रगृह्य चुबुकेऽध्यात्ममुदनीनमदच्युतः॥७॥सा तदर्जुममानाङ्गीबृहच्छ्रेणिपयोधरा। मुकुन्दस्पर्शनात्सद्योबभूव प्रमादोत्तमा॥८॥ततो रूपगुणौदार्यसंपन्ना प्राह केशवम्। उत्तरीयान्तमाकृष्य स्मयन्ती जातहृच्छया॥९॥एहि वीर गृहं यामो न त्वां त्यक्तुमिहोत्सहे। त्वयोन्मथितचित्तायाः प्रसीद पुरुषर्षभ॥१०॥एवं स्त्रिया याच्यमानकृष्णो रामस्य पश्यतः। मुखं वीक्ष्यानु गोपानांप्रहसंस्तामुवाच ह॥११॥ एष्यामि ते गृहं सुभ्रूः पुंसामाधिविकर्शनम्। साधितार्थोऽगृहाणां नः पान्थानां त्वं परायणम्॥१२॥ श्रीमद्भागवत, दशमस्कन्ध, अ. ४२.**

** **The **अजामिलोपाख्यान** occurs in the sixth **स्कन्ध** of **श्रीमद्भागवत.**

The story is told in order to glorify the power of the name ofViṣṇu or Nārāyaṇa. The story may be summarised as follows:Ajāmila was a Brahmin living in Kānyakubja. He had become depraved by associating with a slave-girl. He had tensons, the youngest of whom, Nārāyaṇa by name, was verydear to the parents. In course of time Ajamila lay on deathbed, and saw three dreadful looking men-the **यमदूतऽ**. Thereupon he involuntarily cried out to his son Nārāyaṇa. Nosooner did he utter the name Nārāyaṇa than the **विष्णुदूतऽ**hurried up to the spot and intercepted the **यमदtतऽ**whowere trying to snatch away the life of Ajāmila.Then & conversation ensues between the **यमदूतऽ** and**विष्णुदूतऽ.** The **यमदूतऽ**said that Ajāmila deserved to bepunished for his evil deeds; but the**विष्मुदूतऽ**retorted that allsins, no matter how great their number, are destroyed by themere utterance of the name of Viṣṇu or Nārāyaṇa. (Read:**अयं हि कृतनिर्वेशो जन्मकोट्यंहमामपि। यद्व्याजहार विवशो नाम स्वस्त्ययनं हरेः॥एतेनैव ह्यघोनोऽस्य कृतंस्यादघनिष्कृतम्। यदा नारायणायेति जगाद चतुरक्षरम्॥ स्तेनःसुरापो मित्रध्रुग्ब्रह्महागुरुतल्पगः। स्त्रीराजपितृगोहन्ताये च पातकिनोऽपरे। सर्वेषामप्यघवतामिदमेव सुनिष्कृतम्। नामव्याहरणं विष्णो र्यतस्तद्विषया मतिः॥ भा.** V1. 2.7-10.) Ajāmila was released. He felt penitent, went toGangādvāra, and renounced all worldly pleasures; uitimately,after death, he gained himself the divine form of a, **विष्णुपुरुष,**and in an aerial car ascended to the abode of Viṣṇu.

** सीदन्—**Sinking. pres. p. of **सद् (सीद्). मरु–**A desert. **उपेक्ष्यः—**Worthy to be overlooked. For a parallel idea and more orless the same sort of alliteration as in the first half of thisstanza, read: **मत्स्यादिभिरवतारैरवतारचतावता सदा वसुधाम्। परमेश्वर परिपाल्योभवता भवतापभीनोऽहम्॥**Śankarācārya’s **अष्टपदी.**

** **Vs. 13.**—विदित्वा—**Having known it in its nakedness; havingknown it through.**दृश्यम्—**The worldly pageant. etc.**—**Oneis almost tempted to read **विषय** etc. **अन्तर्मुद्रां विधाय—**Withdrawingthe eyes from outside and turning them within, cf. Bh. G.6. 13.**विद्रव्य—**Gerund of the causal of **वि+द्रु**to run away.

**चित्** f.—Consciousness, cognition, Brahman, the First Principle,is **सच्चिदानन्दस्वरूप.** Jagannātha refers to Kṛṣṇa as **चित्** i. e. **चिद्रूप,**for he is identical with Brahman. **नव**etc.**—नवः नभस्यस्य अम्बुदःतद्वत् रुचिः (शोभा) यस्याः। नभस्य—**The month of **भाद्रपद. ‘स्युर्नमस्यप्रौष्ठपदभाद्रभाद्रपदाः समाः।’—अमर**.

 Vs. 14.—The poet wants to show that the name of Kṛṣṇais far sweeter than any other sweetness in the whole range ofthe universe. **मृद्वीका—**Grapes. **सिता—**Sugar. **स्फीन—**p. p. of **स्फाय्**to increase **स्वर्** adv.—The heaven. **अधायि—**3rd pers. sing.Aor. pass. of **धे** to drink. **कतिधा—**In how many ways; broadly,how often. **‘संख्याया विधार्थे धा’।**Fān. 5–3–42 **रम्भाघर खण्डितः—**Biting of the lower lip of the beloved betrays the ecstaticamorousness of the lover.

 Vs. 15—The poet now shows the greatness and the powerof the name of Kṛṣṇa, **वज्रंं पापमहीभृताम्—**Just as the adamant ofIndra is the deadly enemy of mountains (See notes on Prāstāvi k.Vs. 86), so is the name of Kṛṣṇa to mountains of sins. **भवगदोद्रेक—भवएव गदः(रोगः) तस्य उद्रेकः (आधिक्यम्)।**Acute disease inthe form of worldly existence. **मिथ्याज्ञान** etc.**—मिथ्याज्ञानमेष निशातस्या विशालं च तत्तमः।** The pitchy darkness of the night of IgnoThe position is this: Brahman alone is real; the worldIs illusory **(ब्रह्म सत्यम जगन्मिथ्या)**. Yet in actual experience everyone feels and acts as if the world and its contents are real. Thisis False Knowledge or Nescience. When this Nescience isremoved by the light of knowledge, or as the poet here argues,by Śri Kṛṣṇa, then the individual recognizes the truth. **तिग्मांशुतिग्मा अंशवो यस्य सः** The sharp-rayed one i. e., the sun. **क्रूरक्लेशमहीरुहाम्—कूराश्चतेक्लेशाः, ते एव महीरुहः, तेषाम्।** The trees in the formof painful tortures. **उरूमरज्वालाजटालः—उरुमर** can be linked inthree ways in the context : (i) **उरुः भरःयस्य सः। उरुमरः ज्वालाजटालश्च।**The fire **(शिखि)** blazing with flames and having a wideexpanse. (ii, **उरुणाभरेण युक्ताः ज्वालाः उरुमरज्वालाः (म. प. लो.) ताभिःजटालः—**Raging with mighty flames. (iii)**महीरुहमरस्य(महासमूहस्य) ज्वालाजटालः शिखी—**The fiercely blazing fire to the multi

tude of trees. Of course, here, the comp. will be**सापेक्ष**. Yetwe can say, with Mallinath on various occasions, **सापेक्षत्वेऽपि गमकत्वात् समासः. निर्वृति—**Happiness, here, Highest Happiness,Beatitude.

 Vs. 16.**—कोऽपि—**Some one i. e. Kṛṣṇa**बन्दुर्न कार्यस्त्वया—**Markthe manner in which the poet tenders his advice. Just as onewould never enter into friendship with a stranger who islikely to harm one & one’s friends, so. says the poet, the heartshould not befriend Kṛṣṇa for he is sure to destroy the **विषयऽ**which are so dear to it. **उद्गिरद्भिः**Emitting. The point, then, is:Kṛṣṇa destroys the attraction of the worldly objects and thus liberates the heart from their thraldom. Obviously therefore,it is the duty of every one to make friends with Kṛṣṇa. cf.**विषया विनिवर्तन्ते निराहारस्य देहिनः। रसवर्जं रसोऽप्यस्य परं दृष्टवा निवर्तते॥**Bb. G. 2. 59.

 Vs. 17.—The poet continues to dwell on the power andsweetness of the name of Kṛṣṇa. **अव्याख्येया–न व्याख्यातुं शक्याः**Indescribable. **अन्तर्निमग्ना—**Settled within i. e. in the heart.When the name of Kṛṣṇa is uttered in the heart, it conduces toindescribable pleasure. Here the poet refers to the **परा वाणी**which is one of the four varieties of speech, the other threebeing **पश्यन्ती, मध्यमा,** and **वैखरी. कण्ठे लग्ना—**uttered in the throat.This is **मध्यमा. ध्वान्तदजालम्—**Cloud of darkness i. e. ignorance,**रसना—रसना** and **रसज्ञा** are synonyms of **जिह्वा. ‘रसज्ञा रसना जिह्वा’।अमर**. Here, however, the poet uses the word **रसज्ञा** with an eyeon its etymological meaning **रसं जानातीति रसज्ञा.** If the tongue isliterally **रसज्ञा**i. e can appreciate taste, it should taste only the best sweetness and that is the name of Kṛṣṇa.

 Vs. 18.**—एव–**To be sure, no doubt. **वासना—**Liking. **ऊर्ध्वाक्षैः—ऊर्ध्वे अक्षिणी येषां तैः।** With their eyes directed upwards. **निजसखम्—निजः सखा, तम्. सखिन** is changed to **सख** at the end of a Tatp. comp.according to the Sūtra **‘राजाहः सखिभ्यष्टच्।’–**Pān 5. 4. 91. **कृष्णाभिधानम्—कृष्ण इत्यभिधानं यस्य तत्.** Named Kṛṣṇa. Cātakas, as iswell known, look up to the clouds for water. An onlooker,

says the poet, is at once reminded of the divine Kṛṣṇa whose complexion is dark and glossy like the cloud; therefore, he concludes, cātakas which render this service are the birds of his choice!

 Vs.19.**—विष्वद्रीच्या—**All–pervading, reaching everywhere.**विष्वक्(सर्वत्र) अच्चति इति.** The word is formed in a peculiar way;**विष्वक** is changed to **विष्वद्रि** before **अञ्च्,** **‘विष्वग्देवयोश्चटेरद्र्यञ्चतावप्रत्यये।’**—Pān. 6. 3. 92. The masc. base becomes **विष्वद्र्यञ्च्**, and the fem**.विष्वद्रीची.** The universe shines through the all–pervading lustre of Viṣṇu. cf. **तमेव भान्तमनुभाति सर्वे तस्य भासा सर्वमिदं विभाति।**Kāthak, 2. 2. 15. **यत्—**Since. **प्रत्ययालम्वनम्—**The support or the substratum of the cognition. **सर्वेषां** etc.—Everyone feels the conviction ‘I’about oneself. Now, what is this ‘I'? To what object does this knowledge of ‘I’refer? Well, this object is the Inner divinity who is Viṣṇu **स्वहृदयगतावेदिनः—स्वहृदयगतं न विदन्ति इति.** Not recognizing Him who resides in their own hearts. Viṣṇu, as the **अन्तर्यामिन्,** isever present in men's hearts. Still, they run about and ask others where Viṣṇu is!

 Vs. 20.**—सेवा—**Service, devotion. The reference to Viṣṇu as **लक्ष्मीपति** suggests that this line is addressed to one who seekswealth **(अर्थार्थिन्).** Cf. **चतुर्विधा भजन्ते मां जनाः सुकृतिनोऽर्जुन। आर्तो जिज्ञासुरर्थार्थी ज्ञानी च भरतर्षभ॥** Bh. G. 7. 16. **चिन्ता—**Contemplation.**चक्रायुध—**Viṣṇuwhose weapon is the discus. This word suggests that a man in dangers **(आर्त)** is addressed. The poet assures him that Viṣṇu wields his weapon & he wiĪll surely remove the dangers looming over his protége. **आलापः—**Conversation.**‘स्यात्संभाषणमालापः’—अमर. गाथा—**Derived from the rt.**गै**to sing. Songs, stories. **स्मररिपोः—**Of Śiva. This is the only reference to Siva in this Vilāsa dedicated to Kṛṣṇa or Viṣṇu And it appears somewhat strange at first sight that Jagannātha here recommends the singing of the praises of Śiva and not of Kṛṣṇa. But when it is noted that this line is addressed to & **जिज्ञासु भक्त,**the reference to Śiva transpires to be intentional and justified.

Tho real knowledge is the knowledge of the Oneness of Existence. The **जिज्ञासु** therefore should not distinguish between **विष्णु**and **शिव** for, ultimately, both are identical with Brahman.**निःर्गलसुखम्—**Ever-lasting happiness, Beatitude. cf. **सुखमक्षय्यम्**(Bn. G 5.21), or **अत्यन्तं सुखम्** (Ibid. 6. 28). This line isobviously addressed to & **ज्ञानी. ‘तथा चरण चतुष्टयेऽर्थाभ्यादिजिज्ञासुज्ञानिकर्तृकाश्चतुर्विधा भक्तयो ध्वन्यन्ते।’अच्युतराय. सेवा, चिन्ता (i. o स्मरण)**and **आलाप (i.e. कीर्तन)** also represent some forms of theninefold **भक्तिः—श्रवणं कीर्तनं विष्णोः स्मरणं पादसेवनम्।अर्चन वंदनंदास्यंसख्यमात्मनिवेदनम्॥**

** **Vs. 21.**—भवग्रीष्म** etc.**—भव एव ग्रीष्मः, तस्य प्रौढातपस्य निवहेन संतप्तानिवपूंषि येषाम्।** To the meritorious, the world is a hot-bed ofcares and unmitigated oppression. **द्राक्—**At once. **अविवेकव्यतिकरम्—अविवेकेन व्यतिकरः (सम्बन्धः).** Fetters arising fromIndiscrimination or lgnorance. **विशुद्ध—**clean, clear, untaintedThe **आत्मन्** is often described in Vedanta philosophy as **शुद्धबुद्धमुक्तस्वभावः आत्मामृतसरः—**The lake full of the water of the Atman.**नैराश्यशिशिरे–निराशस्य भावः तेन शिशिरे.शिशिर—**Cool on account ofabsence of des.res. When the mind is buffetted about bydesires, it experiences much anguish. But once a man suppresses his desires and becomes the master of his mind, he comesto enjoy an uncommon peace of mind. is one of theconditions precedent to the realization of the Highest knowledge which is Highest Happiness Cf **एतं वै तमात्मानं विदित्वाब्राह्मणाः पुत्रैषणायाश्च वित्तैषणायाश्च लोकैषणायाश्च व्युत्थायाथ भिक्षाचर्यं चरन्ति।**Bṛh. U. 3. 5, Also, **तद्वत्कामा यं प्रविशन्ति सर्वे स शान्तिमाप्नोति न कामकामी॥** Bh. G. 2. 70. **कलुष** n.—Sin. There is a suggested comparison between good men and elephants. When the elephantsare oppressed by excessive heat, they break through theirfetters and plunge into a pool of clear cold water. The last lineis differently read in some texts; **विगाहन्ते दूरीकृतकलुषमार्याः करटिनः।**

** **Vs. 22.**—बन्धे न्मुक्त्यै—**For theremoval of fetters. बन्धऽtands for the Sansāra**मख—**A sacrifice. **कर्मपाश—**Fetters ofAction. Men perform religious ceremonies**—**Actions**—**with a

view to getting free from the Sansāra. But how foolish theyare, for Actions, good or bad, are veritable feiters themselves.All Action, good or bad, is bound to bear its fruit. The lawof Action is inexorable. So, by the performance of gooddeeds, surely men may be made happy; but they cannot astainsalvatien from the tantaces of worldly Existence. Cf. **कर्मणाबध्यते जन्तुः।**Also **‘प्लवाएते ह्यदृढा यज्ञरूपा अष्टादशोक्तमवरं येषु कर्म।एतच्छ्रेयो येऽभिनन्दन्ति मूढा जगमृत्युं ते पुनरेवापियन्ति॥’Again, ‘ते तंभुक्त्वा स्वर्गलोकं विशालं क्षीणे पुण्येमर्त्यलोकं विशन्ति॥’एवं त्रयीधर्ममनु**प्रपन्ना गतागतं कामकामा लभन्ते॥Bh. G 9 21 **मुनिशत** etc.**—मुनीनां शतानि तेषां मतेषु अनल्पां चिन्ताम्।**People wish to attain to peaceof mind. This they seek by feverish deliberation (**चिन्ता** alsohints at ‘anxieties,’as opposed to **शान्ति**) over the hundred andone views of sages !! cf.**श्रुतिर्विभिन्न मृतयोऽपि भिन्ना नैकोमुनिर्यस्य वचःप्रमाणम्।धर्मस्य तत्त्वं निहितं गुहायां** etc. **अशुभजलधिः—**The ocean of Evil.People wants to cross the ocean of Evil, but for the sake of thisthey drown themselves in holy waters! **प्राभादिकम्—**Broughtabout by mistakes or ignorance. **प्रमादेन निर्वृत्तम् प्रामादिकम्।—**The**प्रमाद** lies in the incompatibility of means employed with the endin view. Mark the contrast between **मुक्ति** and **पाश, शान्ति** and**चिन्ता** and **पारमारोढुकामत्व** and **मज्जन.**

** **Vs. 23.**—प्रथमं चुम्बितचरणा** etc—The proper method of contemplating a divinity is to begin with the contemplation ofthe feet and then rise higher up to the various limbs, cf. **संचिन्तयेद्भगवतश्चरणारविन्दम्** etc.—Bhag. This method is obviously basedon a high sense of reverence, and is also adopted in the description of divine beings. For instance, Kālidāsa begins the description of Pārvatīwith the description of her toes–for whichvide Kumar. 1–33, p. p. Also note Mallināthās observationthereon : **देवतानां रूपं पादाङ्गुष्ठप्रभूति वर्ण्यते मानुषाणां केदाशारभ्येति धार्मिकाः।भावना—**Cotemplative action **जङ्घा** etc.**—**Pāṇini’s rules demandthe Neu. gender and sing. number of a compound of wordsdenoting the limbs of an ‘animal’.**‘द्वन्द्वश्च प्राणितूर्यसेनाङ्गानाम्’।—**Pān. 2–4–2. But as **अच्युतराय** the commentator argues,

Viṣṇu is surely not an animal–He is the One Brahman. Hencethis rule of Pāṇini does not apply here.

 Vs. 24**—कालकूटः–**Deadly prison. **रमणीकुन्तल—**The tresses ofhair of a lovely woman. **भोगिभोगः—भोगिनः भोगः.**The hood of aserpent. **श्वपच—**A Cāṇḍāla. आत्मभूः**—**A son.Tue son is theself of the father born afresh. cf. **आत्मा हि जज्ञे आत्मनः।**A it. Br.**मलयानिल, रमणकुन्तल** and **आत्मज** are objects which cause delightwhile **कालकूट, भोगिभोग,** and **चाण्डाल** are things which are generallyavoided. **निरन्तरा—निर्गतंअन्तरं यस्य सा.** Which knows no cistinction. **परमात्मनि स्थितिः** etc.**—**The poet wishes to attain to thatstate of knowledge which will enable him to realize**‘सर्वंखल्विदं ब्रह्म,’**that nothing besides the **परमात्मन्** exiss, and that,therefore, things, good or bad, high or low, are all in essenceone and the same Brahman. **सर्वभूतात्मभाव** is presented as thegoal. Cf. **विद्याविनयसंपन्ने ब्राह्मणे गवि हस्तिनि। शुनि चैव श्वपाके च पण्डिताःसमदर्शिनः॥** Bh. G. 5.18. Note that in the first two pairs **उत्तम**objects are mentioned before **अधम** ones, while in **श्वपचात्मभुवोः,**the order is reversed. Why? Because, as Jagannāth explainshimself, in the Highest state of **व्रह्मत्मभाव**there can be nodistinction between any two things—all is one. **‘यद्यपि प्रथमार्धेउत्तमाधमयोरुपक्रमाद्वितीयार्धेऽधमोत्तमवचनं क्रमभङ्गमावहति, तथापि वक्तुर्ब्रह्मात्मकतयो**(R. G. reads **जाता**in place of **भूयात्**) **त्तमाधमज्ञानवैकल्यं संपन्नमितिद्योतनाय क्रमभङ्गो गुण एव॥** B. G. 34.

Whenlife is so precarious, and the ultimate end of life is death, surelyrational beings should feel alarmed and bestir themselvesto work out their salvation instead of blindly enjoying  
worldly objects.

 Vs. 27.**—कृपण—**A sword. **कृतान्तः—**God of death, Yama.**मनाक्—**even slightly. In passionate words, the poet assertsthat he would rather court poverty, physical harm, or evendeath, but he would never swerve even slightly from his duties.

Thepossession of elephants is looked upon as the high—watermark of worldly opulence, cf.**—मदजलदुर्दिनान्धकारगजघटितधनघटापरिपालिता (लक्ष्मीः)।** Kād. (**शुकनासऽ** Advice). **द्रविणरसपर्याकुलदृशाम्—द्रविणस्य रसेन (आस्वादेन) पर्याकुला दृक् (दृष्टिः) येषां तेषाम्।** Whoseeyes are rolling on account of the taste of wealth. Wealth iscompared with an intoxicating drink. Just as an intoxicatingdrink renders the eyes unsteady and therefore perplexed; similarly men who have drunk the wine of wealth lose their sigh. (i. e. powers of discrimination). cf. **यदाढ्यानामग्रे द्रविणमदनिः संज्ञमनसाम्।** Bhar. 3. 36. **सौकर्यम्—सुकरस्य भावः**Ease of doing.**अस्तं अय्—**to vanish.

 Vs. 31.**—निःशङ्कम्—**Adv. comp. Fearlessly. **वयसः शेषे—**fag-end of life. **निकटे** etc.—It is believed that death on the bankof the Ganges leads directly to absolution. The reference isprobably to **काशी. काशी** is known as **मुक्तिपुरी.**Hence, the approachof death on the banks of the Ganges will only be a blessing in disguise. If this verse is understood to be autobio-

graphical, it will go to show that that poet Jagannātha passedhis last days in Benares on the banks of the divine Ganges.But see vs. 45 below.

 Vs. 32.—धावं धावम्—धावित्वा धावित्वा. By continually runningabout. It is a Gerund in **णमुल्. मम शिरसि अस्ति—**Almost a vernacular phrase. Kṛṣṇa is over my head i. e. he is there superintending or looking after me. The verse expresses an alti udeof Resignation unto the protest on of Kṛṣṇa who, the poet believes, will surely pilot his protége safely to his Haven.

 Vs. 33.**—मम मनः—**The poet addresses his own heart ormind. **मनोभवशासनं—मनसि भवः मनोभवः (कामः), तस्य शासनः शिवः।** Thedestroyer of the mine-born God of love-Śiva. cf. Prā-tavik.83 **अनारतम्** adv.—Ceaselessly. **आमन्तम्—**From the pres. p of**आ+म्ना** to contemplate. **संसृतिगर्त—**The chasm of Sansāra **एतावता—**By this much, i. e. by hurling me into the pit of theworld. **पुत्रशोकः—**The sorrow about the son.Kāma is **मनोभव;**he is therefore the son of **मनस्**. The tenor of the verse is asfollows: The poet (or the speaker) is intent upon the contemplation of Śiva; he is fervently praying to Śiva. But, in spiteof his devotion, his mind runs after worldly enjoyments whichare sure to fetter the soul. The poet attributes this adverseattitude of the ‘mind’to the mind’s desire to avenge tue deathof its son (Kāma) by harassing the devotee of Śiva who hadburnt Kama. But no abatement of the mind’s sorrow forits dead son is likely to result from such a course of vicariouspunishment.

 Vs. 34.**—मरकतमणि—**Emeralds which are dark green incolour. **मेदिनीधर—**A mountain. **प्रपेदे—**3 pers. Sing. Perf. pass of**प्र+पद्**. The delusion was caused by the dark complexionof Rāma.

 Vs. 35–The idea is much the same as in the last verse: Onseeing Rāma from afar, the Ṛṣis wondered what that darkglistening thing was! **तरणितनय—**The Jumna. The water of the

Jumna is believed to be darkish in colour as against the whiteness of the water of the Ganges. It could not be the Jumnafor the Jumna is full of water, while the object which the Ṛṣissaw from a distance had none. **ज्योत्स्ना—**Literally, moonlight;here pleasant lustre. **सा मधुरा कुतः—**The lustre of emeralds is notso ‘sweet’—so appealing to the heart. **छाया—Splendour.‘छायासूर्यप्रियां कान्तिः।’–अमर कौतुकम्—**Curiosity. **वनवसतिभिः—वने वसतिर्येषां तैः,** By forest—dwellers.

When Hanumān crossed the ocean andfirst sighted Sīta in the Aśoka garden of Rāvaṇa, he wasdeluded by her lustrous form as to whether what he sawwas lightning fallen on earth or a celestial creeper droppedfrom the celestiel tree. **गुरुनिःश्वसितैः—**By the heavy sighs.Sītā was separated from Rāma and was therefore heaving deepsighs through sorrow. This enabled Hanuman to decide whatexactly she was. **मनीषी—**Intelligent, wise. **निरणैषीत्—**3 pers. sing.Aor. of **निस्+नी**, to decide. From her sighs, the Monkey concluded that she was a woman separated from her lovinghusband.

Brahmins, the custodians of learning, are proverbiallypoor. Learning and wealth seldom go together-most surelynot in a Brahmin. The following verse offers an ingeniousexplanation why Laxmīavoids the Brahmins: **पीनोऽगस्त्येनततश्चरणतलहतो वल्लभोऽन्येन रोषादाबाल्याद्विप्रवर्यैः स्ववदनविवरे धार्यते वैरिणी मे।गेहूं मे छेदयन्ति प्रतिदिवसमुमाकान्तपूजानिमित्तं तस्मात् खिन्ना सदाहं द्विजवरसदनंनाथ नित्यं त्यजामि॥ असत्पथजुषाम्—सनां पन्थाः सत्पथः न सत्पथ; असत्पथः,जुषन्ति इति ०जुषः, तेषाम्.** Of those who resort to the path of Evil,wicked men **समानां शतम्—**A hundred years **समा** is generallydeclined in the plaral. cf. **आपः सुमनसो वर्षा अप्सरः सिकतासमाः। एतेस्त्रियां बहुत्वेस्युरेकत्वेऽप्युत्तरत्रिकम्॥ नाशो इन्त** etc.—Good men dieprematurely, while villains enjoy a good old age. cf. **सृजति**

For the formation of the word**जटाल** see Prāstavik. 35. **किं कुर्वे**etc.—The poet, of course, refersto the flagrant ironies of life. But he is painfully conscious ofhis own helplessness and insignificance; otherwise, it seems.hewould have taught **जगदीश**how to mend His ways!

 Vs. 38.—This stanza marks the beginning of the end ofthe Śāntavilāsa. The following points are to be noted; (i)This stanza and the following ones are sharply different in thenature of their contents from all the preceding stanzas; and, infact, (ii) they have nothing in the connected with the prevailing sentiment of the whole Vilāsa. (iii) Tuey all more orless hold together from the point of view of their contents, andform the concluding portion not only of the Śāntavilāsa but ofthe whole Bhāminīvilāsa as well. (iv) These stanzas showJagannātha’s high self-consciousness as a poet. They breathedefiance and challenge of other poets, almost curses at thosewho cannot appreciate and acknowledge Jagannātha’s worth as& poet, and pontifical sniffs at the humble beginners in therealms of poetry. (v) They refer, again and again, to whatJagannātha looked upon as the one outstanding merit of hispoetry**—माधुर्य.** And lastly, (vi) They are conspicuous for themore or less autobiographical element in them.

**रत्नासानुः—**The Menu mountain, the furthest Northerly outpost known to Indian mythology. **मलयवलयित—मलयेन वलयितः(संजातवलयः)** Fringed by the Malaya mountain.

However much out of good taste it may beto mention one’s greatness, here, at least, Jagannātha may beexcused the use of the word **पण्डितपति**about himself, for he maybe referring to the title**‘पण्डितरााज’**which he had received fromthe Emperor Shaha Jehan. **अधुन्वन्—नधुन्वन्.धुन्वन्—**Pres. P. of**धु** 5 con., to shake, to nod.

Mark the self-conscious vein of the stanza.

 On reading these verses, one cannot help wondering whether Jagannātha knew that **इन्द्रोऽपि लघुतां याति स्वयं प्रख्यापयन् गुणान्.**What would Bhartṛhari have said about these stanzas,for in his opinion **निजगुणकथा** is nothing short of a sin? cf.**कृतं वीतव्रीडैर्निजगुणकथापातकमपि;** Bhart. 3. 36. Jagannātha, however, does not seem to be severely alone in this respect, cf.Jayadeva’s words about himself : **विलासो यद्वाचामसमरसनिष्यन्दमधुरःकुरङ्गाक्षीबिम्बाधरमधुरभावं गमयति। कवीन्द्रः कौण्डिन्यः स तव जयदेवः श्रवणयोरयासीदातिथ्यं न किमिह महादेवतनयः॥** Pra. R. 1. 14.

 Vs. 42.**—मार्मिकः—मर्म जानातीति मार्मिकः.**One who knows thesecret. **अत्यन्तपाक** etc.**—अत्यन्तं णकेन (परिणत्या) द्रवन्त्याः मृद्वीकायाःमधुमाधुरीमदः (मधुनः माधुर्येण जनितो मदः), तस्य परीहारे (निरसनकर्मणि)उद्धुराः(समर्थाः), तासाम्।** The whole phrase is in apposition to**चाचाम्.** The idea is essentially the same as that in the third pādaof Vs. 38. **परीहार—**the **इ** in **परि** is lengthened according to theSūtra **उपसर्गस्य घञ्यमनुष्ये बहुलम्।—**Pān. 6. 3. 122. **उद्धुर—**Lit., Onewho has thrown off the yoke; hence, bold enough, powerfulenough. **संमुखे मादृशाम्—**In the presence of men like me.Note

the standard which Jagannātha sets for all aspirants forrecognition as poets to conform to. Moreover, this verseshows that in the opinion of Jagannātha a poetic composition,whatever its other qualities, must needs possess **माधुर्य. स्वान्तम्—**the heart. **नो चेत्**etc.—A poem wanting in **माधुर्य**does not deservea recital in the presence of poets like Jagannātha! Fortunately,such a‘highbrow’attitude is not shared by many; otherwise the number of mute Miltons would swell–to the detriment, in the last analysis, of the Muse of poetry herself.contrast Jagannātha’s characteristic words **किं सेव्यते सुमनसांमनसाऽपि गन्धः कस्तूरिका जननशक्तिभूतामृगेण।** (R. G.) with the moresensible view of Jayadeva: **अपि मुदमुपयन्तो वाग्विलासैः स्वकीयैःपरभणितिषु तोषं यान्ति सन्तः कियन्तः। निजघनमकरदस्यन्दपूर्णालवालः कलशसलिलसेकं नेहते किं रसालः॥** Pra. R. 1. 19.

 Vs. 43**—वाचंयमाः—**Studiously restrain their tongue, **वाचंयम** isused only when the sense of a vowis to beconveyed; otherw se **वाग्यम**is used. Does not this line apply toJagannātha himself? His complaint may well be met by the‘Tu quoque’argument, in the light of the last verse. **कमलाविलास** etc.**—कमलायाः (लक्ष्म्याः) विलासाः एव मदिरा, तया उन्मीलन् (उद्भवन्)यो मदः तेन घूर्णिताः (पर्याकुलिताः)** Kings are mad with the intoxication of wine in the form of dalliance with Laxmi (or gracefulmovements of Laxmī). For the idea, compare: **बोद्धरो मत्सरग्रस्ताःप्रभवः स्मयदूषिताः। अबोधोपहनाश्चान्ये जीर्णमङ्गेसुभाषितम्॥** Bhart. 3. 2.**लस्यम्—**Gentle dance. There are two varieties of dance—one,wild and boisterous, is called **ताण्डव,** and the other, mild andgentle, is called **लास्य,** Compare : **मधुरोद्धतभेदेन तद् द्वयं (नृत्यand नृत्त)द्विविधं पुनः। लास्यताण्डवरुपेण नाटकाद्युपकारकम्।**D R. 1. 10. **कामालस** etc.**—कामेन अलसा या स्वर्वामा तस्या अधरस्य माधुरी.** The sweetness of thelower lip of a heavenly damsel who is slothful through theinfluence of love. **अधरय्—**Pres. p. of the Denominative verbfrom **अधर,** low. **अधरय्—**to lower, to throw into the back-ground.**विपाकः—**Maturation.

 Ve. 44. **—धुर्य—**Outstanding; excellent **धुरं वहतीति धुर्यः, ‘धुरो**

**यड्ठकौ’** (Pān. 4 4. 77.) **इति यत्.** Note the alliteration in thefirst half of the verse. **माक्षिकम्—**Honey.

 Vs. 45.–This verse is distinctly autobiographical. **आकलितानि–**Studied. Jagannātha speaks of himself as**‘मननतरितीर्णविद्यार्णवः’**in R. G. **नित्यविधयः—**Daily rites like **संन्ध्यावंदन** etc. **दिल्लिवल्लभ—**TheEmperor Shah Jehan whose warm patronage the poet enjoyedand from whom he received the title **पण्डितराज. नवीनं वयः–**youth. **संप्रति–**Now. **उज्झितवासनम् उज्झिताः वासनाः यस्मिन् कर्मणि तत्तथा.**Having renounced all desires. **मधुपुरी—**Muttra.This lineshows that the poet spent his last days in Muttra. But insome places, this line is differently read : **संप्रत्यन्धकशासनस्य नगरेतत्त्वं परं चिन्त्यते।** This reading would indicate that the poet wentto Kāśi in his old age. For a discussion of this point, see the ntroduction. **तिलक–**The mark on the forehead;hence, anornament. **अकारि—**3 pers. sing. Aor. Pass, of **कृ.**

** **Vs. 46.**—दुर्वृत्ताः—दुष्टंवृत्तं येषाम्.**Villains, ill-behaved men.**जारजन्मानः–जारेभ्यःजन्म येषाम्.** Bastards; born without blue bloodin their veins. Mark the vehemane of Jagannātha’s hostileattitude towards plagiarists. **हरिष्यन्तीति शङ्कया—**The same kindof suspicion had troubled Jayadeva, too; cf. **तेन हि निजनाटकमर्पयित्वेदमुक्तऽस्मि–‘रक्षणीयमिदं सूक्तिरत्नं चौरेभ्यः’इति।**Pra R. 1. **मञ्जूषा—**A safe. This line is important because it shows the genesisof the present work.
