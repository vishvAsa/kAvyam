**FOREWORD**

**RAMAYANA MUKTAVALI.**

<MISSING_FIG href="../books_images/U-IMG-172620864461.png"/>

It is a happy idea of Sri T. Srinivasa Raghavacharya to offer to students and lovers of Sanskrit an anthology of didactic verses collected from that vast storehouse of beauty and wisdom, Valmiki Ramayana. The selection has been made with discrimination and the little book abundantly repays perusal. The English translation, which is quite a successful attempt at reconciling conformity to the original with the demands of English idiom, will make these veritable 'pearls' of wisdom available to a wider circle of readers.  
 I heartily commend the compiler's suggestion that students for whom this book is mainly intended should memorise these verses which will serve to guide them through many of life's perplexities.

***M. Patanjali Sastri.***

**AUTHOR'S NOTE.**

<MISSING_FIG href="../books_images/U-IMG-172620872414.png"/>

 This little book contains almost all the 'Neeti Slokas' or moral sayings culled out from Srimad Valmiki Ramayana, with an English rendering of the same. I need hardly say that even one with the Gandhian command of English language cannot render a happy translation of the Sanskrit verses into English and sometimes a close literal translation, even if it were possible, looks rather uncouth. My present endeavour therefore, is mainly to convey in English the idea of the original Sanskrit verses, giving a true translation wherever possible and necessery. Like lustrous pearls gathered from the deep ocean these invaluable pearls of Valmiki are collected from out of the unfathomable depths of the vast ocean of Ramayana and hence the book is styled as 'Ramayana Muktavali'. Though this little book may be welcomed by all the English-Sanskrit knowing lovers of Ramayana, it is mainly intended for students whom I request to get the verses by heart with great advantage to them not only during their scholastic career but also in their everyday life thereafter.

Respectfully dedicated  
to  

SAGE VALMIKI

 who, more than the divine hero and heroine of his immortal work, is a source of perennial inspiration to me and to whose silent blessings I entirely owemy feeble knowledge of Srimad Ramayana.

**१. अलङ्कारो हि नारीणां क्षमा तु पुरुषस्य वा।  
 क्षमा दानं क्षमा सत्यं क्षमा यज्ञश्च पुत्रिकाः॥  
  क्षमा यशः क्षमा धर्मः क्षमया विष्ठितं जगत्॥**

(33_9)

 Forbearance is an ornament to men and woman alike. Forbearance is charity, Forbearance is virtue, Forbearance is sacrifice, Forbearance is fame, Forbearance is righteousness; in fact the entire world rests on forbearance.

**२. न चावज्ञा प्रयोक्तव्या कामक्रोधवशादपि।**

(13_14)

 As a rule none should be treated with indiffernce actuated by greed or anger.

**३. अवज्ञया न दातव्यं कस्यचिल्लीलयापि वा।  
अवज्ञया कृतं हन्याद्दातारं नात्र संशयः ॥**

(13_33)

 Nothing should be given to any one with callousness even in joke. If anybody violates this law he will doubtless be ruined.

**४. नृशंसमनृशंसं वा प्रजारक्षणकारणात्।  
पातकं वा सदोषं वा कर्तव्यं रक्षता सता।  
राज्यभारनियुक्तानामेष धर्मः सनातनः।**

(25_18)

 It behoves those who are responsible for the protection of the subjects under their care to do all that are needed cruel or not, sinful or blameworthy. This is the Law eternal for those who had taken the reigns of the government.

**५. रक्षांसि सन्ध्याकालेषु दुर्धर्षाणि भवन्ति वै।**

(26_22)

 The Rakshasas become uncontrollable when twilight sets in.

**६. चलं हि यौवनं नित्यं मानुषेषु विशेषतः।**

(32_16)

 Youth is ever transcient, the more so among human beings.

**७. पिता हि प्रभुरस्माकं दैवतं परमं हि नः।  
यस्य नो दास्यति पिता स नो भर्ता भविष्यति॥**

(32_21)

 Father is our (maidens') lord and he is verily our supreme God. He to whom we are betrothed by him will be our husband.

**८. धिग्बलं क्षत्रियबलं ब्रह्मतेजोबलं बलम्।  
एकेन ब्रह्मदण्डेन सर्वास्त्राणि हतानि मे॥**

(56_22)

 Fie upon the prowess of the khshatriyas. The brahmic might is the real power. All my missiles were shattered to pieces by a single brahminic wand.

**९. दैवमेव परं मन्ये पौरुषं तु निरर्थकम्।  
दैवेनाक्रम्यते सर्वं दैवं हि परमा गतिः॥**

(58_22)

 Fate is more powerful than human prowess Everything in the world is preordained and everything is regulated by the decrees of Fate.

**१०. प्रायेण हि नरश्रेष्ठ ज्येष्टाः पितृषु वल्लभाः।  
मातृणां च कनीयांसः...............॥**

(61_18)

 The eldest-born is generally the pet of the father and the youngest of the mother.

**॥अयोध्याकाण्डम्॥**

**११. भूयो विनयमास्थाय भव नित्यं जितेन्द्रियः।  
कामक्रोधसमुत्थानि त्यजेथा व्यसनानि च॥**

(3_42)

 Be more humble and ever control thy senses. Get over the evils resulting from desire and anger.

**१२. तुष्टानुरक्तप्रकृतिर्यः पालयति मेदिनीम्।  
तस्य नन्दन्ति मित्राणि लब्ध्वाऽमृतमिवामराः॥**

(3_43)

 The friends of a prince who rules his kingdom to the joy and contentment of his thriving subjects delight his friends even as the advent of nector rejoiced the gods.

**१३. चला हि प्राणिनां मतिः।**

(4_20)

 People are generally fickle-minded.

**१४. किं तु चित्तं मनुष्याणामनित्यमिति मे मतिः।  
सतां तु धर्मनित्यानां कृतशोभि च राघव॥**

(4-27)

 Human minds are rarely constant and ever changing. It is only by their constant deeds the virtue of the good is shown.

**१५. भयं भीताद्धि जायते।**

(8_5)

 Awe comes from those who fear.

**१६. सन्निकर्षाच्च सौहार्दं जायते स्थावरेष्वपि।**

(8_28)

 Even immoveables become attached to us by constant contact with them.

**१७. गतोदके सेतुबन्धो न विधीयते।**

(9_54)

 There is no purpose in constructing a dam after the water had flown out.

**१८. धिगस्तु योषितो नाम शठाः स्वार्थपराः सदा।  
   न ब्रवीमि स्त्रियः सर्वाः भरतस्यैव मातरम्॥**

(12_103)

 Fie upon those who call themselves women, who are ever wily and self-seeking ! I don't mean all women, but only those who are akin to Kaikeyi, Bharata's mother.

**१९. सत्यमेकपदं ब्रह्म सत्ये धर्मः प्रतिष्ठितः।  
   सत्यमेवाक्षया वेदाः सत्येनैवाप्यते परम्॥**

(14_7)

 Truth is the Almighty God resorted to by all; truth is embodied in virtue, in truth converge the everlasting Vedas and it is trutb that leads us to Beatitude.

**२०. यश्च रामं न पश्येत्तु यं च रामो न पश्यति।  
   निन्दितः स वसेल्लोके स्वात्माप्येनं विगर्हति॥**

(17_14)

 Any one who sees not Rama nor is seen by Him is scorned everywhere and he even detests himself.

**२१. न ह्यतो धर्मचरणं किंचिदस्ति महत्तरम्।  
यथा पितरि शुश्रूषा तस्य वा वचनक्रिया॥**

(19_22)

 There is no virtue higher than service to one's father and obedience to his commands.

**२२. एक एव हि वन्ध्यायाः शोको भवति मानसः।  
अप्रजाऽस्मीति सन्तापो न ह्यन्यः (पुत्र) विद्यते॥**

(20_37)

 Barren women have an only grievance that they are childless and nothing more.

**२३. गुरोरप्यवलिप्तस्य कार्याकार्यमजानतः।  
उत्पथं प्रतिपन्नस्य कार्यं भवति शासनम्॥**

(21_13)

 Even a preceptor must be punished, if only he, actuated by pride, acts without discriminating the right from the wrong.

**२४. पितुर्हि वचनं कुर्वन् न कश्चिन्नाम हीयते।**

(21_36)

 No evil had come unto those who obey the behests of their father.

**२५. धर्मो हि परमो लोके धर्मे सत्यं प्रतिष्ठितम्।**

(21_40 )

 Virtue reigns supreme in the world. Virtue is entwined with Truth; and to obey the commands of the father is only in consonance with the laws of virtue.

**२६. संश्रुत्य च पितुर्वाक्यं मातुर्वा ब्राह्मणस्य वा।  
 न कर्तव्यं वृथा वीर धर्ममाश्रित्य तिष्ठता॥**

(21_41)

 Having once taken a resolve to abide by thewords of one's father or mother or even a bramhin, a virtuous man ought not to go back on the same.

**२७.धर्मार्थकामाः किल तात लोके  
 समीक्षिता धर्मफलोदयेषु।  
 ते तत्र सर्वे स्युरसंशयं मे  
 भार्येव वश्याऽभिमता सुपुत्रा॥**

(21_56)

 Virtue, material prosperity, and conjugal bliss are but the fruition of leading a truthful life in this world. Even as a devoted wife attains virtue by her devotion to the husband, conjugal bliss by her love and attachment to him, and material prosperity by bringing forth a worthy son, so, if only we lead a truthful life, there is no gainsaying the fact that Virtue, material prosperity and conjugal bliss will automatically follow.

**२८.यस्मिंस्तु सर्वे स्युरसन्निविष्टा  
 धर्मो यतः स्यात्तदुपक्रमेत।  
 द्वेष्यो भवत्यर्थपरो हि लोके  
 कामात्मता खल्वपि न प्रशस्ता॥**

(21_57)

 No action should be done that does not lead to virtue, material prosperity and conjugal bliss. Whatever is done must be in con-

formity with the laws of virtue, One's endeavour for mere material prosperity makes one an object of redicule, and likewise, one's action done solely for conjugal bliss lowers. one's estimation in the eyes of others.

**२९. गुरुश्च राजा च पिता च वृद्धः  
 क्रोधात्प्रहर्षाद्यदि वाऽपि कामात्।  
 यद्व्यादिशेत्कार्यमवेक्ष्य धर्मं  
 कस्तं न कुर्यादनृशंसवृत्तिः॥**

(21_58)

 If a preceptor of mature age who is also a king and a father wants to uphold truth by carrying out his resolve and thereby. commands his son to do a certain act, be he actuated by anger, joy or passion, who else will transgress his words other than the wicked?

**३०. सुखदुःखे भयक्रोधौ लाभालाभौ भवाभवौ।  
 यच्च किंचित्तथाभूतं ननु दैवस्य कर्म तत्॥**

(22-22)

 Weal and woe, fear and anger, profit and loss, existence and non-existence and many other things in the world for which no cause can be attributed are but the decrees of Providence.

**३१. ऋषयोऽप्युग्रतपसो दैवेनाभिप्रपीडिताः।  
 उत्सृज्य नियमांस्तीव्रान् भ्रंश्यन्ते काममन्युभिः॥**

(22_23)

 Even the mighty sages of lofty penance have to yield to the dictates of Fate and are

decoyed from their life of austerity by desire and anger.

**३२. असंकल्पितमेवेह यदकस्मात्प्रवर्तते।  
 निवर्त्यारम्भमारब्धं ननु दैवस्य कर्म तत्॥**

(22_24)

 The unforeseen weight of the sudden fall of a stroke on our efforts is but the silent work of Fate.

**३३. राज्यं वा वनवासो वा वनवासो महोदयः।**

(22_29)

 Regal splendour and forest life are both akin. But if properly understood the latter should be preferred to the former.

**३४. विक्लबो वीर्यहीनो यः स दैवमनुवर्तते।  
 वीराः संभावितात्मानो न दैवं पर्युपासते॥**

(23_16)

 It is only the coward and unchivalrous that quietly submit to Fate! The chivalrous and the self-confident do not depend on Fate.

**३५. दैवं पुरुषकारेण यः समर्थः प्रबाधितुम्।  
 न दैवेन विपन्नार्थः पुरुषः सोऽवसीदति॥**

(23_17)

 One who is capable of conquering Fate by his manliness, won't regret, if his actions are thwarted by Fate.

**३६. भर्तुः किल परित्यागो नृशंसः केवलं स्त्रियाः।**

(24_12)

 It is simply cruel for women to discard their husbands.

**३७. जीवन्त्या हि स्त्रिया भर्ता दैवतं प्रभुरेव च।**

(24_21)

 For a' wife during her life time, the husband is both God and lord alike.

**३८. व्रतोपवासनिरता या नारी परमोत्तमा।  
 भर्तारं नानुवर्तेत सा तु पापगतिर्भवेत्॥**

(24_25)

 Though a woman may attain a very high position by the observance of fasts and ceremonies, she has only to tread the path of sinners, if she is not devoted to her husband.

**३९. भर्तुः शुश्रूषया नारी लभते स्वर्गमुत्तमम्।  
 अपि या निर्नमस्कारा निवृत्ता देवपूजनात्॥**

(24_26)

 A wife devoted to the service of her lord attains the lofty heavenly abode even though she does not adore the Gods and is devoid of other qualities.

**४०. शुश्रूषामेव कुर्वीत भर्तुः प्रियहिते रता।  
 एष धर्मः पुरादृष्टो लोके वेदे श्रुतः स्मृतः॥**

(24_27)

 A true wife should ever be desirous of serving her husband in all that is conducive to his good and happiness. This is the law Eternal expounded by the Vedas and the codes of morals.

**४१. कृतान्तस्य गतिः... दुर्विभाव्या सदा भुवि।**

(24_35)

 The ways of Providence in the world are always inscrutable.

**४२. ऋद्धियुक्ता हि पुरुषा न सहन्ते परस्तवम्।**

(26_25)

 Men of power and self-will, do not brook the praise of others.

**४३. आराधिता हि शीलेन प्रयत्नैश्चोपसेविताः।  
 राजानः संप्रसीदन्ति प्रकुप्यन्ति विपर्यये॥**

(26_35)

 Those who serve their kings by their industry and good conduct win their smiles and favours; while others become the target of their frowns and anger.

**४४. औरसानपि पुत्रान्हि त्यजन्त्यहितकारिणः।  
 समर्थान्संप्रगृह्णन्ति जनानपि नराधिपाः॥**

(26_36)

 The kings discard even their own kith and kin if the latter act against their interests, and favour only those that are loyal and dexterous even though they belong to the common folk.

**४५. (आर्यपुत्र) पिता माता भ्राता पुत्रस्तथा स्नुषा।  
 स्वानि पुण्यानि भुञ्जानाः स्वं स्वं भाग्यमुपासते॥**

(27_3)

 Father, mother, brother, son and daughter-in-law do all individually attain the fruits of their karma good or bad.

**४६. भर्तुर्भाग्यं तु भार्यैका प्राप्नोति।**

(27_4)

 It is the wife alone that shares her husband's fate.

**४७. न पिता नात्मजो नात्मा न माता न सखीजनः।  
 इह प्रेत्य च नारीणां पतिरेको गतिस्सदा॥**

(27_5)

 Neither the father nor the son, nor her own self nor the mother nor the friend is the final resort of a woman. The husband is her only resort both in this world and the world beyond.

**४८. प्रासादाग्रैर्विमानैर्वा वैहायसगतेन वा।  
 सर्वावस्थागता भर्तुः पादच्छाया विशिष्यते॥**

(27_8)

 To repose still under the shadow of the husband's feet is at all times more delightful than dwelling in palace tops or a pleasure drive in aroplanes.

**४९. पतिहीना तु या नारी न सा शक्ष्यति जीवितुम्॥**

(29_7)

 A woman who is separated from her husband cannot sustain her life.

**५०. श्रुतिर्हि श्रूयते पुण्या ब्राह्मणानां तपस्विनाम्।  
 इहलोके च पितृभिर्या स्त्री यस्य (महामते )॥  
 अद्भिर्दत्ता स्वधर्मेण प्रेत्यभावेऽपि तस्य सा॥**

(29_18)

 The brahmin sages have stated that the Divine Vedas proclaim that she who in this

world, is given in marriage to one, by her father and elders with the sprinkling of the holy water in accordance with their religious custom, is his wedded wife even in the world beyond.

**५१. स्वर्गो धनं वा धान्यं वा विद्याः पुत्राः सुखानि च।  
 गुरुवृत्त्यनुरोधेन न किञ्चिदपि दुर्लभम्॥**

(30_36)

 Heavenly bliss, wealth, agricultural products, knowledge, progeny and happiness are all obtained by mere service to preceptors and there is nothing that cannot be derived from it.

**५२. आनृशंस्यमनुक्रोशः श्रुतं शीलं दमः शमः।  
 राघवं शोभयन्त्येते षड्गुणाः पुरुषोत्तमम्॥**

(33_12)

 Harmlessness, mercy, erudition nice manners, control of senses and control of mind, these are the ornaments adorning the person of Rama who is the foremost among a॥  
persons.

**५३. मूलं ह्येष मनुष्याणां धर्मसारो महाद्युतिः।  
 पुष्पं फलं च पत्रं च शाखाश्चास्येतरे जनाः॥**

(33_15)

 Rama who is the very essence of virtue, is the resplendant root of the tree of all created humanity whereof all other human beings are but flowers and fruits, leaves and branches.

**५४. न हि क्षुभ्यति दुर्धर्षः समुद्रः सरितांपतिः।**

(3_46)

 The unfathomable ocean, the lord of all the rivers, keeps to the banks.

**५५. पिता हि दैवतं तात देवतानामपि स्मृतम्।**

(34_52)

 It is taught in the Vedas that a father is the God of every one even of Gods.

**५६. भर्तुरिच्छा हि नारीणां पुत्रकोट्या विशिष्यते॥**

(35_8)

 It is nobler for a woman to carve to the taste of her husband than carving to the tastes of a crore of her children.

**५७. आम्रं छित्वा कुठारेण निम्बं परिचरेत्तु यः।**  
** यश्चैनं पयसा सिञ्चेत् नैवास्य मधुरो भवेत्॥**

(35_14)

 One who fells a (fruit bearing) mango tree by an axe and plants a margosa in its place cannot reap a tasty fruit even though he might water it with milk.

**५८. न हि निम्बात्स्रवेत्क्षौद्रं लोके निगदितं वचः।**

(35-15)

 It is a well-said proverb in the world that honey cannot be extracted from margosa.

**५९. पितॄन्समनुजायन्ते नरा मातरमङ्गनाः।**

(35-26)

 Men possess the traits of their father, and women those of their mother.

**६०. यो हि दत्वा गजश्रेष्ठं कक्ष्यायां कुरुते मनः।  
 रज्जुस्नेहेन किं तस्य त्यजतः कुञ्जरोत्तमम्॥**

(37_3)

 If one has an attachment to the rope after giving up a mighty elephant, of what avail is it to him after the loss of the elephant.

**६१. आत्मा हि दाराः सर्वेषां दारसंग्रहवर्तिनाम्।**

(37_24)

 The wife is the soul of all those who lead a wedded life.

**६२. असत्यः सर्वलोकेऽस्मिन् सततं सत्कृताः प्रियैः।  
 भर्तारं नानुमन्यन्ते विनिपातगतं स्त्रियः॥**

(39_20)

 However much a loving husband may satisfy the wants of faithless wife, he is discarded by her in his times of distress.

**६३. एष स्वभावो नारीणां अनुभूय पुरा सुखम्।  
 अल्पमप्यापदं प्राप्य दुष्यन्ति प्रजहत्यपि॥**

(39_21)

 It is the charecteristic of the womenfolk to enjoy in times of prosperity (of their husband) but abuse and even discard him at the slightest advent of adversity.

**६४. असत्यशीला विकृता दुर्ग्राह्यहृदयाः सदा।  
 युवत्यः पापसङ्कल्पाः क्षणमात्राद्विरागिणः॥**

(39_22)

 It is also the charecteristic of faithless women to lead a false life, do acts unworthy

of them, possess a heart ever unfathomable, be inclined to do sinful acts and in a trice cease to be affectionate.

**६५. न कुलं न कृतं विद्यां न दत्तं नापि संग्रहम्।  
 स्त्रीणां गृह्णाति हृदयं अनित्यहृदया हि ताः॥**

(39 \_ 23)

 A woman's affections cannot be won over by nobility of birth, or the help rendered or education or gifts or even the sacred marriage tie, because by nature they are not constant.

**६६. साध्वीनां तु स्थितानां हि शीले सत्ये श्रुते शमे।  
 स्त्रीणां पवित्रं परमं पतिरेको विशिष्यते॥**

(39_24)

 For those high-souled women who are truthful, cultured and patient and have a clean conduct there is none more sacred than their husband.

**६७. नातन्त्री वाद्यते वीणा नाचक्रो वर्तते रथः।  
 नापतिः सुखमेधेते या स्यादपि शतात्मजा॥**

(89_29)

 A veena (a musical instrument) without strings and a chariot without wheels are on a par with a woman without a husband. She derives no enjoyment even though she might have a hundred sons.

**६८. मितं ददाति हि पिता मितं माता मितं सुतः।  
 अमितस्य हि दातारं भर्तारं का न पूजयेत्॥**

(39_30)

 Father, mother, and son all contribute to the happiness of a woman only to a limited extent. Which woman will not worship her husband who unlimitedly contributes to her joy any welfare.

**६९. काम एवार्थधर्माभ्यां गरीयानिति मे मतिः।**

(53_9)

 Cupid's sway, methinks, is often mightier than gain and rights.

**७०. अर्थधर्मौ परित्यज्य यः काममनुवर्तते।  
 एवमापद्यते क्षिप्रं राजा दशरथो यथा॥**

(53_13)

 He who seeks after sexual happiness devoid of virtue and material prosperity sinks into the mire like King Dasaratha.

**७१. न परेणाहृतं भक्ष्यं व्याघ्रः खादितुमिच्छति।**

(61_16)

 Tigers disdain another's prey.

**७२. गतिरेका पतिर्नार्याः द्वितीया गतिरात्मजः।  
 तृतीया ज्ञातयो राजन् चतुर्थो नेह विद्यते॥**

(61_27)

 For a woman, the husband is her first resort, the son is the second and the relations are the third but there is no fourth for her in this world.

**७३. भर्ता तु खलु नारीणां गुणवान्निर्गुणोऽपि वा।  
 धर्मं विमृशमानानां प्रत्यक्षं देवि दैवतम्॥**

(62_8)

 For those women who lead a life of virtue the husband with or without character is their visible God.

**७४. नैषा हि सा स्त्री भवति श्लाघनीयेन धीमता।  
 उभयोर्लोकयोर्वीर पत्या या संप्रसाद्यते॥**

(62_13)

 She who is always at loggerheads with her husband, however good and wise he may be, her lord here and hereafter, does not merit the name of wife.

**७५. शोको नाशयते धैर्यं शोको नाशयते श्रुतम्।  
 शोको नाशयते सर्वं नास्ति शोकसमो रिपुः॥**

(62_15)

 Affliction destroys a man's courage, affliction destroys his learning, affliction destroys all that is good in him, in fact there is no greater enemy to him than affliction.

**७६. शक्य आपतितः सोढुं प्रहारो रिपुहस्ततः।  
 सोढुमापतितः शोकः सुसूक्ष्मोऽपि न शक्यते॥**

(62_16)

 It is possible to endure a physical blow from the hands of an enemy but it is difficult to bear the pangs of grief however slight they may be.

**७७. धर्मज्ञाः श्रुतिमन्तोऽपि छिन्नधर्मार्थसंशयाः।  
 यतयो वीर मुह्यन्ति शोकसंमूढचेतसः॥**

(62 \_16A)

 Even ascetics well-versed in the laws of virtue, cultured and proficient in the Dharma

Sastras to the highest degree fall a prey to grief and lose their mental equilibrium.

**७८. यदाचरति कल्याणि शुभं वा यदि वाऽशुभम्।  
 तदेव लभते भद्रं कर्ता कर्मजमात्मनः॥**

(63_6)

 दोषं वा यो न जानाति स बाल इति होच्यते॥**

 स शोचेत्फलवेलायां यथा किंशुकसेचकः॥**

 नाराजके पितुः पुत्रो भार्या वा वर्तते वशे॥**

 As is the sight to guide the body invariably in the daily avocations of life, so is the king to guide the kingdom in the path of truth and virtue.

**१०६. राजा सत्यं च धर्मश्च राजा कुलवतां कुलम्।  
 राजा माता पिता चैव राजा हितकरो नृणाम्॥**

 तस्मात्प्रियतमो मातुः प्रियत्वान्न तु बान्धवाः॥**

 No help will come to a king if he seeks advice from thousands of evil advisers, or even a ten-thousand of them.

**११६. एकोप्यमात्यो मेधावी शूरो दक्षो विचक्षणः।  
 राजानं राजमात्रं वा प्रापयेन्महतीं श्रियम्॥**

(100_25)

 Even if there be a single minister, if only he is wise, brave, clever and discreet he will bring fame and prosperity to a king big or small though he may be.

**११७. उपायकुशलं वैद्यं भृत्यसंदूषणे रतम्।  
 शूरमैश्वर्यकामं च यो न हन्ति स वध्यते॥**

(100_30)

 He who does not check the propensities of a clever and learned adviser, who takes delight inteasing the subordinates, who desires wealth, though valourous, is easily crushed in the end.

**११८. कालातिक्रमणाच्चैव भक्तवेतनयोभृताः।  
 भर्तुः कुप्यन्ति दुष्यन्ति सोऽनर्थः सुमहान्स्मृतः॥**

 तानि पुत्रपशून्घ्नन्ति प्रीत्यर्थमनुशासतः॥**

(100_60)

 The tears that flow from the eyes of those falsely accused, destroy the children and cattles of him who rules merely to enjoy (royalty).

**१२१. नास्तिक्यमनृतं क्रोधं प्रमादं दीर्घसूत्रताम्।  
 अदर्शनं ज्ञानवतां आलस्यं पञ्चवृत्तिताम्॥**

(100_65)

**एक चिन्तनमर्थानां अनर्थज्ञैश्च मन्त्रणम्।  
निश्चितानामनारम्भं मन्त्रस्यापरिरक्षणम्।**

(100_66)

**मङ्गलस्याप्रयोगं च प्रत्युत्थानं च सर्वतः।  
...........................राजदोषा चतुर्दश॥**

(100_67)

 These are the fourteen vices of a king-atheism, untruth, anger, carelessness, procrastination, neglect of the learned, laziness, slavery to the senses, sole idea of amassing wealth, counsel with those that do not know the proper way, non-commencement of the decided issues, absence of caution for secrets, non-use of the auspicious, and showing respect to all and sundry.

**१२२. ज्येष्ठपुत्रे स्थिते राजन् न कनीयान्नृपो भवेत्।**

(102_2)

 The younger son should not be enthroned when there is the elder.

**१२३. यदन्नः पुरुषो भवति तदन्नास्तस्य देवताः।**

(104_15)

 Whatever food a man takes, that has to be offered to his God.

**१२४. सुजीवं नित्यशस्तस्य यः परैरुपजीव्यते।  
 (राम) तेन तु दुर्जीवं यः परानुपजीवति॥**

(105_7)

 One who is depended upon by others leads a happy life; whereas one depending on others leads a miserable life.

**रामगीता**

**१२५. नात्मनः कामकारोऽस्ति पुरुषोयमनीश्वरः।  
 इतश्चेतरतश्चैनं कृतान्तः परिकर्षति॥**

(105_15)

 Man is not free to do anything as he likes as he is powerless. God alone moves him hither and thither in all his actions.

**१२६. सर्वे क्षयान्ताः निचयाः पतनान्ताः समुच्छ्रयाः।  
 संयोगाः विप्रयोगान्ताः मरणान्तं च जीवितम्॥**

(105_16)

 All the accumulated treasures perish. Every climax has an anti-climax. All attachments end in separation and all life must come to an end.

**१२७. यथा फलानां पक्वानां नान्यत्र पतनाद्भयम्।  
 एवं नरस्य जातस्य नान्यत्र मरणाद्भयम्॥**

(105_17)

 All ripe fruits must drop down from the tree. Even so a man has to await the inevitable hour.

**१२८. यथाऽगारं दृढस्थूणं जीर्णं भूत्वाऽवसीदति।  
 तथैव सीदन्ति नरा जरामृत्युवशंगताः॥**

(105_18)

 Even as a house with firm and massy pillars dilapidates, men are withered by old age and eventually die.

**१२९. अत्येति रजनी या तु सा न प्रतिनिवर्तते।  
 यात्येव यमुना पूर्णा समुद्रमुदकाकुलम्॥**

(105_19)

 A night that had passed will not return; even as the waters of the Yumuna getting into the ocean do not flow back

**१३०. अहोरात्राणि गच्छन्ति सर्वेषां प्राणिनामिह।  
 आयूंषि क्षपयन्त्याशु ग्रीष्मे जलमिवांशवः॥**

(105_20)

 Just as the sun's rays evaporate quickly all water during summer, even so the rolling days and nights hasten our end.

**१३१. आत्मानमनुशोच त्वं किमन्यमनुशोचसि।  
 आयुस्ते हीयते यस्य स्थितस्य च गतस्य च॥**

(105_21)

 Why do you grieve for others. Grieve for thyself as every moment of yours is graudually taking away your life whether  
you remain stationery or move about.

**१३२. सहैव मृत्युर्व्रजति सह मृत्युर्निषीदति।  
 गत्वा सुदीर्घमध्वानं सह मृत्युर्निवर्तते॥**

(105_22)

 Death closely follows a man wherever he goes and wherever he sits, and returns with him, however long may be the distance travelled by him.

**१३३. गात्रेषु वलयः प्राप्ताः श्वेताश्चैव शिरोरुहाः।  
 जरया पुरुषो जीर्णः किं हि कृत्वा प्रभावयेत्॥**

(105_23)

 Wrinkles begin to appear all over the body and the hairs turn grey. Man's mortal

frame is crumbled by old age. By doing what will he be able to overcome it?

**१३४. नन्दन्त्युदित आदित्ये नन्दन्त्यस्तमिते रवौ।  
 आत्मनो नावबुध्यन्ते मनुष्या जीवितक्षयम्॥**

(105_24)

 At the day dawn men are delighted with their acquisitions and at sun-set they revel in nocturnal pleasures. But they forget that their life is shortened by each sun-rise and sun-set.

**१३५. हृष्यन्त्यृतुमुखं दृष्टा नवंनवमिहागतम्।  
 ऋतूनां परिवर्तेन प्राणिनां प्राणसंक्षयः॥**

(105_25)

 Men rejoice at the advent of a season which comes afresh. The life of every being is shortened by the changes of seasons.

**१३६. यथा काष्ठं च काष्ठं च समेयातां महार्णवे।  
 समेत्य च व्यपेयातां कालमासाद्य कञ्चन॥**

(105_26)

** एवं भार्याश्च पुत्राश्च ज्ञातयश्च धनानि च।  
 समेत्य व्यवधावन्ति ध्रुवो ह्येषां विनाभवः॥**

(105_27)

 Just as a tidal wave brings together two wooden pieces in a vast ocean and another wave separates them, even so wife and sons, relatives and wealth live together for a short while and get themselves separated thereafter. The separation of these is certain.

**१३७. नात्र कश्चिद्यथाभावं प्राणी समधिवर्तते।  
 तेन तस्मिन्न सामर्थ्यं प्रेतस्यास्त्यनुशोचतः॥**

(105_28)

 There is not one who can live as he intends. What power then has he over the death of those for whom he grieves.

**१३८. यथा हि सार्थं गच्छन्तं ब्रूयात्कचित्पथि स्थितः।  
 अहमप्यागमिष्यामि पृष्ठतो भवतामिति॥**

(105_29)

**  एवं पूर्वगतो मार्गः पितृपैतामहो ध्रुवः।  
 तमापन्नः कथं शोचेद्यस्य नास्ति व्यतिक्रमः॥**

(105-30)

 As a by-stander on a road coming across a batch of travellers would say he will also follow them, even so do we follow the footsteps of our fore-fathers. How can a person grieve when he is in that track from which he' cannot swerve ?

**१३९. वयसः पतमानस्य स्रोतसो वाऽनिवर्तिनः।  
 आत्मा सुखे नियोक्तव्यः सुखभाजः प्रजाः स्मृताः॥**

(105_31)

 Like a torrent which cannot flow back, past life cannot be retraced. Life should therefore be directed towards happiness, as people want to live a life of bliss.

**१४०. एते बहुविधाः शोका विलापरुदिते तथा।  
 वर्जनीया हि धीरेण सर्वावस्थासु धीमता॥**

(105_35)

 A courageous and intelligent man shall avoid in all moods and states these various forms of griefs, lamentations and cries.

**१४९. यथा मृतस्तथा जीवन् यथाऽसति तथा सति।  
 यस्यैष बुद्धिलाभस्यात्परितप्येत केन सः॥**

(106_4)

 If only one realises that death is only another phase of life and that non existence here is another form of existence somewhere, what an earth can perturb him.

**रामगीता संपूर्णा**

<MISSING_FIG href="../books_images/U-IMG-172628107660.png"/>

**१४२. अन्तकाले हि भूतानि मुह्यन्तीति पुरा श्रुतिः।**

(106_13)

 It is a traditional saying that senility comes to all when they near their end.

**१४३. पितुर्हि समतिक्रान्तं पुत्त्रो यः साधु मन्यते।  
 तदपत्यं मतं लोके विपरीतमतोऽन्यथा॥**

(106_15)

 It is not proper for the son to approve of the wrong action of the father when that act is against the wishes of the people and the recognised canons of convention.

**१४४. चतुर्णामाश्रमाणां हि गार्हस्थ्यं श्रेष्ठमाश्रमम्।**

(106_22)

 Of the four ashrams or the stages of life, that of the householder is the best.

**१४५. कः कस्य पुरुषो बन्धुः किमाप्यं कस्य केनचित्।  
 यदेको जायते जन्तुरेक एव विनश्यति॥**

(108_3)

 Who is related to whom in this world and what is there to be obtained by an object here? Every creature is born alone and dies alone.

**१४६. यथा ग्रामान्तरं गच्छन्नरः कश्चित्क्वचिद्वसेत्।  
 उत्सृज्य च तमावासं प्रतिष्ठेतापरेऽहनि॥  
 एवमेव मनुष्याणां पिता माता गृहं वसु।  
 आवासमात्रं (काकुत्स्थ) सञ्जन्ते नात्र सज्जनाः॥**

(108_5,6)

 Just as a traveller bound for a destination halts on his way at a particular place and leaves it the next day, even so a man in his journey of life abodes a father, mother, house and wealth. Great men do not cling to them.

**१४७. निर्मर्यादस्तु पुरुषः पापाचारसमन्वितः।  
 मानं न लभते सत्सु भिन्नचारित्रदर्शनः॥**

(109_3)

 People who have no restraint, who commit acts of sin and violate the rules of conduct will not be respected by the great.

**१४८. कुलीनमकुलीनं वा वीरं पुरुषमानिनम्।  
 चारित्रमेव व्याख्याति शुचिं वा यदिवाऽशुचिम्॥**

(109_4)

 A man's conduct will reveal his lineage, valour, high or low birth, and purity or other- wise of his thought and deed.

**१४९. अनार्यस्त्वार्यसंकाशः शौचाद्धीनस्तथाऽशुचिः।  
 लक्षण्यवदलक्षण्यो दुःशीलः शीलवानिव॥**

(109_5)

** अधर्मं धर्मवेषेण यदीमं लोकसङ्करम्।  
 अभिपत्स्ये शुभं हित्वा क्रियां विधिविवर्जिताम्॥**

(109_6)

 To pretend to be virtuous when there is none, to pretend to be pure when really one is not, to appear as possessing all the good qualities that make a righteous man, to pretend to be a man of principles, when one does not have any and to act unrighteously in the garb of righteousness — all these are to be condemned.

**१५०. कामवृत्तस्त्वयं लोकः कृत्स्नः समुपवर्तते।  
 यद्वृत्ताः सन्ति राजानः तद्वृत्ताः सन्ति हि प्रजाः॥**

(109_9)

 As is the king so are his subjects. If the king is sensuous his subjects will also be likewise.

**१५१. सत्यमेवानृशंसं च राजवृत्तं सनातनम्।  
 तस्मात्सत्यात्मकं राज्यं सत्ये लोकः प्रतिष्ठितः॥**

(109_10)

 Ancient government was resting on truth and mercy. Truth was the principal factor of a kingdom as the universe rests on truth.

**१५२. ऋषयश्चैव देवाश्च सत्यमेव हि मेनिरे।  
 सत्यवादी हि लोकेऽस्मिन्परमं गच्छति क्षयम्॥**

(109-11)

 Gods and sages regard truth as the best virtue. One who utters truth at all times obtains eternal bliss.

**१५३. उद्विजन्ते यथा सर्पान्नरादनृतवादिनः।  
 धर्मः सत्यं परो लोके मूलं स्वर्गस्य चोच्यते॥**

(109_12)

 Just as people are frightened at the mere sight of a cobra, so are they when they see a liar. The best virtue is truth and paradise is also based on truth.

**१५४. सत्यमेवेश्वरो लोके सत्यं पद्माश्रिता सदा।  
 सत्यमूलानि सर्वाणि सत्यान्नास्ति परं पदम्॥**

(109_13)

 God is but truth; and all virtues follow truth. Everything good comes of truth and there is nothing higher than truth.

**१५५. दत्तमिष्टं हुतं चैव तप्तानि च तपांसि च।  
 वेदाः सत्यप्रतिष्ठानास्तस्मात्सत्यपरो भवेत्॥**

(109_14)

 Gifts, sacrifice, penance and the holy Vedas all are based on truth. Therefore we must ever follow truth.

**१५६. एकः पालयते लोकमेकः पालयते कुलम्।  
 मज्जत्येको हि निरये एकः स्वर्गे महीयते॥**

(109 \_ 15)

 One protects the world and another protects his clan. One hies to the damned hell and another enjoys the heavenly bliss.

**१५७. असत्यसन्धस्य सतश्चलस्यास्थिरचेतसः।  
 नैव देवा न पितरः प्रतीच्छन्तीति नः श्रुतम्॥**

(109_18)

 The Gods and the forefathers do not bestow the appropriate fruits for the religious rituals done by those who are not truthful but are fickle-minded.

**१५८. कायेन कुरुते पापं मनसा संप्रधार्य च।  
 अनृतं जिह्वया चाह त्रिविधं कर्म पातकम्॥**

(109_21)

 An untruth emanates from the mind, tongue and body, because the mind thinks of it, the tongue utters it and the body translates it into action.

**१५९. भूमिः कीर्तिर्यशो लक्ष्मीः पुरुषं प्रार्थयन्ति हि।  
 स्वर्गस्थं चानुपश्यन्ति सत्यमेव भजेत तत्॥**

(109_22)

 Kingdom, fame and name, and wealth await a truthful man and follow him even after he quits this world for the other. There- fore one must ever be wedded to truth.

**१६०. कर्मभूमिमिमां प्राप्य कर्तव्यं कर्म यच्छुभम्।  
 अग्निर्वायुश्च सोमश्च कर्मणां फलभागिनः॥**

(109_28)

 Fire, Air and Moon have now become Gods, because prior to their becoming so, they did righteous acts when they were in this world and as a consequence of their having done so now enjoy an enviable status.

**१६१. सत्यं च धर्मं च पराक्रमं च  
 भूतानुकम्पां प्रियवादितां च।  
 द्विजातिदेवातिथिपूजनं च  
 पन्थानमाहुः त्रिदिवस्य सन्तः॥**

(109_31)

 The virtuous say that truth, virtue, fortitude, kindness to all, sweet-words, reverence to Gods, brahmins and guests lead to the portals of Heaven.

**१६२. धर्मे रताः सत्पुरुषैः समेताः तेजस्विनो दानगुणप्रधानाः।  
 अहिंसका वीतमलाश्च लोके भवन्ति पूज्या मुनयः प्रधानाः॥**

It has become almost impossible for the average man in this workaday world to make a complete and useful study of our ancient classics like the Ramayana, in the original. But they contain invaluable lessons for all who cherish Indian ideals. The book under notice is an *omnium gatherum* of quotations, especially moral sayings, from Valmiki Ramayana with the English translation of the slokas. Though mainly intended by the author to be memorised by students, the slokas may well be regarded by all as a guide to our daily conduct.

These quotations, show the profundity of Valmiki's wisdom, as well as his deep knowledge of the world. The verses are fit to be memorised, particulary by students, as the author suggests. The learned compiler has translated the same in English so that there might be an intelligent appreciation of the‘‘pearls"
