<p>The maxim of the blind man and the bull’s tail.</p>
<p>This maxim is based on the following anecdote: Once upon a time a certain blind man started from his native village, intending to go to a neighbouring big city. He had not plodded on far, when he met a barber, fond of practical jokes. The latter accosted the former and learnt from him, that he, the blind man, was travelling to town, where, he thought, plenty of alms was to be had for the mere asking. The barber, finding a sure victim of his jokes, told the blind man that he would find him a guide. He thereupon took him to a field, where a bullock was grazing, and let him catch his tail. He then said to him: “My friend, here is a sure guide for you. Don’t leave him whatever happens, and in spite of all that wicked people might say to do you a mischief.” The blind man soon reached not the town, but the heart of a thorny bush!</p>

Now the man thought within himself, “there are so many persons in the boat that it would be no wonder if I lose myself and be transferred and changed to one of them.” In order to avert such a calamity, Ahibhuk, bound his foot with a piece of rope to keep a mark upon himself, and then feeling easy in his mind, fell fast asleep. The boatman chanced to overhear the man’s loud soliloquy, and saw his queer manoeuvres; and soon finding the man snoring stentoriously, he untied the rope from the man’s feet and fastened to his own.
