# **सुभाषितानि**

भाषासु मुख्या मधुरा दिव्या गीर्वाण भारती। तस्यां हि काव्यं मधुरं तस्मादपि सुभाषितम्॥ द्राक्षा म्लानमुखी जाता शर्करा चाश्मतां गता। सुभाषितरसम् दृष्ट्वा सुधा भीता दिवां गता॥

### **विनयस्तत्र सुदुर्लभः**

नरत्वं दुर्लभं लोके विद्या तत्र सुदुर्लभा।  
शीलं च दुर्लभं तत्र विनयस्तत्र सुदुर्लभः॥  
In this world, to take birth in the human race is rare, wherein to obtain knowledge and wisdom is even harder. Further to have a noble character is harder and further still is modesty.

Wanting to reform the wicked with nectar-sweet advice, is like trying to control an elephant with the pith of a lotus-stem, or cutting a diamond with delicate petals of the Shireesh flower, or sweetening the salty ocean with a drop of honey.

The Ganges descended from the heavens upon the head of Shiva, and thence, to the mountains. From the high mountains, she flowed down the plains to finally lapse into the sea. Thus, the Ganges kept drifting downwards from one level to another. Similarly, those who have lost their sagacity plunge downwards in a hundred ways. Note: The Ganges became proud that she emerged from Vishnu's feet, and lost her sense of bearing

Bracelets do not adorn a person. Nor do pearl necklaces shining like the moon, or a cleansing bath; nor anointment of the body, nor flowers, nor decoration for the hair. It is cultured speech alone which embellishes a man. All other ornaments lose their glitter, only the jewel of speech ever remains the jewel of jewels.

Knowledge is certainly a man's greatest beauty. It is a safe and hidden treasure. It provides prosperity, fame and happiness. Knowledge is the guru of all gurus. It acts as one's friend in a foreign country. Knowledge is the Supreme God. It is the knowledge, not wealth, which is adored by kings. Without knowledge one remains as animal.

The companionship of good people removes the inertia of one's mind, nurtures truth in the speech, enhances prestige, expiates the sins, comforts the conscience, spreads the name and fame in all directions. Say! what good is there which the company of devout does not bring to a man.

The path of service is formidable. It is difficult even for a yogi to follow. If a man in service remains quiet, then he is called dumb. If he is quick-witted, then he is described as loquacious. If he stays close by, then he is taken to be audacious, and if he maintains a distance, then is considered as shy. If he is tolerant, then he is regarded as timid, and if he is unable to bear indignities, then he is known as ill bred.

Indeed, a son is he who makes his father happy with his good deeds. The woman who is a well-wisher of her husband is a wife in the real sense. A friend who remains alike in times of happiness and misery, is a true friend. Verily, men obtain these three only as a result of their good deeds.

He restrains his friend from committing sins, and induces him to do good deeds. He conceals the unseemly secrets of a friend, projecting only his good qualities. He does not desert his friend in difficulties, but gives timely assistance. Saints describe these as the characteristics of a true friend.

It is to remain settled in one's own country. What is ruler ship? It is to command obedience.

One should sacrifice one's self-interest for the sake of one's family, one's family for the sake of one's town members, one's town members for for the sake of one's nation, and sacrifice the whole earth for the sake of one's soul's enlightenment.

There is no kingdom nor any king! No criminal nor any judge to give the penalty to the criminal!! All the people protect each other by the virtue of Dharma (The meaning of Dharma being explained in Subhaashita No.17). This is a 'varnan' of an 'Aadarsha' samaj!! A samaj which is a 'live' samaj in which each and every individual lives completely up to his responsibility!! Only a samaj which will be made up of such 'ideal' individuals can 'realise' the above subhaashita!! One example is worth mentioning. If the number of social service organisations such as orphanages, child care centres etc. keep growing then is it a healthy sign of progress of society or not?? Infact such institutions will come up because the relatives or neighbours may have failed to do their Dharma!! this is told by Bhishmacharya to Yudhisthir in shantiparva (after mahabharat war). while he was lying on "sharapanjari" waiting for bed. Bhishmacharya is generally telling dharmaraja about hou good his rule should be. you may have noticed that the subhashit is in past tans. this situation (praja dharmeNaiva parasparm rakshanti sma) was there in India long back. much before raja-praja system was introduced. to my knowledge ekshwaku was the first king (any body can correct me if i'm wrong.)

Lakshman, This Golden Lanka does not allure me. Mother and Motherland is dearer to me even than heaven. This 'Shloka' is from the conversation between Lord Shree Ram and Lakshmana in 'Valmiki Ramayana'. It is very appropriate to remember the shloka on the occasion of Vijayadashami. Over six thousand years ago, after the great Victory over Ravana, on the day of Vijayadashami, Lord Shree Ram tells Lakshmana that He was not interested in the wealth of Lanka and did never want to rule Lanka. He would rather go back to His Motherland. Later 'Vibheeshana' was made the king of Lanka.

According to him rAvaNa's body was not worthy of proper treatment. to this our shrirAma says, now that he is dead, he is not our enemy and deserves proper sanskara. compare this against how Mongol (or in general muslim) invaders trreated with bodies of our kings.

In contrast a unintelligent ('Murkha') man gets satisfaction in bad habits like sleep (Laziness), quarrel or some type of addiction. Tatparya (Conclusion): In this subhaashita the subhaashitkar has in short advised the reader that how should one spend his/her time!! May be according to him a 'buddhiman' is a person who invests his time in order to get some thing 'valuable' and long lasting!!

It is said that, if one dilutes milk with water, and gives to swan, swan is able to extract milk and drink it. (dudh ka dudh pani ka pani) Swan is white, crane is (also) white. (then) what is the difference between crane and swan? when it comes to extracting milk from a mixture, swan is swan and crane is crane. i.e. crane does not have this ability. This subhashit is trying to explain that the external appearance does not make a person great but his qualities. It also explains that wise people precisely know what is useful and what is not.

What the subhAshitkar wants to covey through this subhAshita is that the greatest of the tasks can be done by arranging/organising the small small things. This message is coveyed by giving the example of a thick rope that is used to bind an elephant. A thick rope gains it's strength due to it's innumerous small threads that are binded together, which in turn has so much of strength as to hold an elephant. 'Small drops of water makes the ocean' also conveys the same meaning.

Meaning Line 1 There is only one bird (Khag) who has very high self esteem and self respect, Let that that Chataka (that bird's name) live long life (Chiranjeev) Meaning line -2 Line two explains why is he called Khagomani. He would prefer to die because of thirst but will ask for water only from God Indra (Purandar). Means, he drinks only rain water. He will never drink water from the pond or stored water. Such high self respect and self esteem he has. In our context we can take it this way, if you want to ask some thing then ask that greatest almighty who is the supreme self and not anyone else. If we want to be like Chataka or if we want to learn something from this bird. In other words dont do Yachana( Yachana is like asking something from some one as u are in need) to any one but only to the greatest authority which is GOD. This bird comes in many contexts in Marathi or Sanskrit. There is a phrase used when u are waiting on something we say , u are waiting like Chataka (Who waits for raindrop to feed himself water)

अध्याय 4

Just like a donkey which carries the sandal wood on it's back doesn't know the importance (Or 'Value') of the sandal wood but only knows (Realises) about some weight which is put on it's back, in the same way many learned people who have studied the 'Shaastras' (Sciences) don't realise the true meaning of it and simply carry the 'weight' of the knowledge!

The sea which is only collecting the water and not giving to anyone (Rather it's water cannot be used by humans directly for drinking/cooking) is present at the lower ground level of earth and in contrast the clouds which donate the water ('jala daan') thunder from the higher altitudes. Here the subhAshitkAra wants to emphasise that the person who does the 'daana' (One who donates- The act of giving the personal belongings) always achieves the higher place than the person who just does the 'sangraha' (collection) without the 'daana'.

(pay attention as to how words are used here) If (the word) "sAkShara" (literate) is inverted, it becomes "rAkShasa" (devil). (but) if (the word) "sarasa" (good) is inverted, it remains "sarasa" This meaning is apparent if we play word game. But the the other more imp. meaning is as follows, A "sakshara" (literate or educated person) can behave like a "rakshas" (a wicked person) in certain situations. But a "saras" (good person, cultured person, gentleman) will not leave his this property (of being good person) in any condition. Subhashitkar is telling us to be a sarasa person along with being sAkShara.

Giving food to the hungry is a good deed (Donation of the food is a very good donation - 'anna dAnam'). But more than the above type of 'dAna', educating the people (Teaching - 'vidya dAnam') is more better type of 'dAna' because by food one's hunger would be calmed down only for the time being. But the knowledge attained is helpful for whole of our life. Therefore it is said that 'vidya dAna' is the most important among various other types of dAna. Also refer to the previous subAshit Kr. 51 (The wealth of knowledge is the most superior wealth of all!)

(but) a wicked person has it (poison) everywhere in his body. subhAShitkAr wants to say that these other poisonous animals are better than a wicked person because they are not "fully" poisonous as him.

The subhAshit is talking about the similarity of a coconut tree and a good person. (The coconut tree) remembers the very small amount of (salty) water which it has drunk in its early ages, and it carries very good tasty water on his head throughout its life. In the similar way good people do not forget (even a very small) favour ('upkAr') done to them.(by others)

In this Subhashit, Subhaashitkar is describing those people, whose aim is just to become popular by any means. If we look around in our society, we will find plenty of them. A few people are always engaged in these "ghaTam bhindyAt" types of activities and by that they earn fame, they've got nothing else to bank on. Obviously Subhaashitkar is asking us to check whether we are doing anything like that.

Like wise the strong people who have good qualities will not trouble the poor who have less might as compared to themselves. The other meaning of this subhAshita can be taken as there should be 'dvandva' (Fight) only between the parties of the matching capabilities.

And a good son is a lamp of the whole 'kula' ('kula' is the group of people belonging to the same ancestors). Here the implied meaning of the lamp is the one which shows a correct path to us. It's correct meaning may be perhaps understood by the samskrit line "tamasoma jyotirgamya" - i.e. Lead us from darkness to the Light.

Background:- Life of Hindu person goes through four phases (Ashramas as they are called). the four Ashramas are 1) brahmashcharyAshrama:- person is expected to undergo learning (schooling) in this phase .. to earn 'vidyA'. 2) g^RhasthAshrama:- person is expected to live married life/earn money and serve for his family in this phase. 3) vAnaprasthAshrama:- in this phase person is suppose to serve society selflessly and earn 'puNya'. 4) sanyAsAshrama:- leave material life and devote oneself for 'mokSha'. Meaning of the subhAShita: One who is not able to earn vidyA (does not pay attention to learning) in first (brahmashcharyAshrama). one who is not able to earn wealth (i.e. not serving his family) in second (g^RhasthAshrama) one who is not able to earn puNya (i.e. is not serving society) in third (vAnaprasthAshrama) what he will do in forth (sanyAsAshrama) .. (i.e. he cant attain 'mokSha'). Even in current context this is applicable because we still can divide life in these four ashrams. only thing which have changed is, now a days while thinking of life, we think about first two ashrams only. This subhAShita says that we shall do right things in right phases of life. (also says that all these things are of equal importance).

In case of normal individuals the words follow the meaning. But in case of great sages ('Rishis') the meaning follows their words! Normally a person thinks of the meaning first and then frames the sentence as per that meaning. But in case of the great sages like Vashishta, Vishwamitra the casually uttered words by them would obtain a very deep meaning. This subhAshita gives us an insight in the intellectual level that was obtained by our ancient sages.

This a very nice subhAshita which many of us may have experienced personally! What we have to realise is that we have to put ourselves in the place of that person and then think. Like in english we use the phrase that you have put your foot in the other's shoe!!

The non poisonous snake should also imitate like biting some one! (Only for the sake of self-defence) Regardless of whether the snake has Poisson or not the hissing of snake will create the terror in the other's mind. There is one small story regarding this. Once a poisonous snake used to bite many people passing by the way. When Shri. Shankaracharya came to know this he advised the snake not to bite people and trouble them. After few months when Shri. Shankaracharya was passing by the same way he noticed that the snake had become very much weak and had many wounds. "What's the matter? Why have you become like this?", asked the great seer. It replied, "Oh Master! You only had told me not to bite the people. So when people came to know that I do not cause any harm they started pelting stones at me". Shri. Shankaracharya replied, "I had only told you not to bite the people. But I didn't tell you that you should stop hissing at the others!!" It is said that a 'yogi' should not loose his temper and should be above all the emotions. Then how should a 'yogi' react to the wrong/ill things that people may commit around him? It's perfectly like the nonpoisonous snake above!! He should 'hiss' but should not cause any harm to others.

Subhashitkar here is trying to portray importance of self esteem in life. If one has it, he is as good as living long life. If a person does not have it, then according to subhaashitkar, life and wealth he has, is useless.

There is no sight such as knowledge - i.e. By knowledege ('vidya') one can see what cannot be seen by a naked eye. Knowledge gives the vision to see beyond some obvious things. There is no 'Tapha' (Nearest meaning I think is Hard work) such as Truth - i.e. One has to do lot's of hard work to be on the side of Truth. There is no sorrow such as the desire - i.e. Desires of a person brings much sorrow to him There is no happiness such as sacrifice - i.e. 'TyAga' (Sacrifice) brings more happiness to the person. \[Hard to believe, Isn't it?!!\] This is a very good subhAshit to think over. Many people may have realised "nAsti tyAga samam suKham" in their family life when they personally may have undergone some hardships only to see their kith and keens more happy and satisfied! Who else than our own Mother would be the living example of "nAsti tyAga samam suKham"!!

If a person does not have money/wealth; his friends, sons, wife, and close relatives leave him ( they dont find him interesting any further). If the same person gains his wealth, they all return to him, money/wealth is man's mpanion in this world indeed! Subhashitkar explains bitter fact of life that, we always try to be with a person who can be of some benefit to us. If that person is no longer of use, then we leave him..( refer to subhashit 54 which has similar meaning). this reminds me a joke... "success is relative... more success, more relatives"

A person who travels in different-different countries, ('desha' can also be translated as direction here.). a person who serves scholars (learned person), his intelligence expands or develops as drop of oil on water surface. Often, a person who is very sharp is called 'tailabuddhi'. When a drop of oil falls on water surface, it spreads over water and forms layer of oil; in that way a drop of oil 'covers' water surface (oil is taila in sanskrit). Similarly intelligence (buddhi) of a person (his grasping power) covers all the subjects. Here, subhasitkar says that, a person who travels a lot (and hence meets many people) and is in contact with 'pundits' develops his brain like that drop of oil in water.

It is very difficult for the unmarried girl called praise ('stuti') to get married. The reason is good people ('sajjan' or 'sabhya' people) do not like her (The 'sajjan' people do not like if anybody praises them) and she herself does not like bad ('durjan') people (Nobody praises a bad ('durjan') person). This subhAshit may seem to be a 'not much serious' one. The subhAshitkAr has tried to tell one of the good qualities of a noble person- That a good person does not like to be praised. And so the poetic mind of the subhAshitkar thinks from the point of view of "praise"!! Where will the "praise" go if good people do not like her and who will prefer to go to the bad person?! And so the subhAshitkAr thinks that may be she ('Praise') will never get married!

A beautiful colourful flower but which doesn't have a nice fragrance doesn't seem good. (A flower apart from being colourful should also have a nice fragrance only then it's utility increases) . Similarly without action, only good talks doesn't seem good. To stress the point that apart from being 'kind-spoken' to every one, one should also support it by his/her own actions, the subhAshitkar has given an example of a colourful flower but without fragrance. If flower doesn't spread it's fragrance around then what is the use of it's attractive looks. The colour of the flower is it's external beauty while it's fragrance is it's 'guna' - i.e. one of the qualities. One of the great saints Samartha Swami Ramdas has said 'kriyavena vaachalata vyartha aahe' - i.e. without the 'kartuttva', the 'vaani' has no meaning.

What is use of knowledge to a person who does not have intellectual capacity? what is use of mirror to a person who is blind? Here, the subhAShitkAr has given an excellent analogy. He says that, knowledge is like a mirror, which reflects world in it. Indeed knowledge is something through which we perceive the world. The subhAShitkAr says that person's praGYA or intellect is like his eyesight.. Unless one has it, one can't use a mirror. Similarly if one does not have power to perceive the knowledge or one does not the have aptitude, then this knowledge is useless to him.

Each person (pinDah) has different aptitude / opinion (no two brains are alike). water in different ponds differ. different casts / communities have their own ways of life. ( they have their own rules and regulations etc.) each mouth speaks different language. Subhashitkar here emphasizes that there is a diversity in this world. No two things are same. This to some extent explains our (Indians) tolerance towards different religions / cultures. we accept that all cant be same. By this we alow other to be 'different' and follow their own way.

Beauty is like an ornament (ABharanam) of the human. Good qualities (guNHa) is an ornament of the beauty (rup)! Knowledge (Dnyam) is an ornament of good qualities and forgiveness (KshmA) is an ornament of knowledge. What subhAshitkAr wants to tell us here is that if you are good looking then develop good qualities in you. If you have both then get knowledge/become intelligent. If you have all the three qualities then become kind hearted (Forgive only those who can become good in future). In short good looking is useless without good qualities and good qualities will seem more nice with knowledge and above all forgiveness (i.e. without Kind heartedness having all other qualities) will make the above qualities person a real good person.

Oh Goddess Saraswati, your treasure of knowledge ('vidyA') is indeed very amazing! If spent it grows ('vrudhim') and if unused (Without using it only accumulating it - 'sanchayAt') it becomes less!! It may be the common experience of every one that the knowledge that an individual has, keeps growing only if that individual applies that knowledge in practical work or in giving it to others. If unused, we keep forgetting what we have learnt. And so here the subhAshitkAr thinks that unlike other treasures, the treasure of knowledge in indeed a superior one! And so the advise given to us is also that we should not be self-centered in matters of giving knowledge to others because that helps even us also!!

There is only one Truth (God) - Sages call it by different names such as agni, yama, vAyu. If anyone asks what is the uniqueness of the Bharatiya samskruti then we can quote the above 'shloka'. Any art, music,literature etc. which gives happiness to the individual is no doubt very good. But these arts cannot be "only" as the source of entertainment. The subhAshitas that we are sending are sent with the aim that these should not only seem good to the readers but it should also have a 'Value' embedded in it, which the reader should try to understand and implement in the individual life. Thinking in this line the above shloka was selected to be sent as the 100th subhAshit. Today there are many religions, cultures etc. in the world which often have clashes between them. They are fighting between themselves due to their difference in opinions on the concept of God, Liberation etc. In this context we should think that what may be the idea/contribution of Bharatiya samskruti in this regards. Does it have a unique idea that may bring peace on this land. Does the oldest civilization has any thing to say, to give to the world? Rigveda is the ancient written document on this earth. The above 'shloka' says that the 'Truth' is ONE, but the sages call it by different names as per their own personal experience (Self-Realization). If this is the case then why should different religions fight among themselves only because of difference in names and forms of their conception of God? This is the teaching that makes Bhratiya Samskruti a 'Universal' samskruti. There is no ONE "Prophet" and no ONE "Holy Book". Every person therefore in 'Bharatiya samskruti' has the right to discover God in his own way. This one 'shloka' makes Bharatiya Samskruti the most unique in the world.

This is the last 'shloka' in the Rigveda. It states - Let your conclusions be ONE (or be alike), Let your hearts be the same (or be alike) \[So that "everyone" feels for the same particular bad/ill in the society in the same intensity. It may be the common experience that not all feel for the same problem in the 'intensity' that we as individual may feel for that. Due to this there may be lack of 'collective' efforts to solve that problem\]. Let your minds think alike/similar. May all these factors make your organisational-power an impressive one. This 'shloka' can be called as an 'sanghatan-sukta' i.e. guidelines for building an impressive organisation/nation.

Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak had ended his book 'Geeta Rahasya' by this 'shloka'.

A person who does the things which are to be done and who doesn't do the things which are not to be done; a person who sticks to rational behaviour (or behaves rationally), is called "Arya".

The term "Arya" is used to refer to elder or respectable person in India. This subhashita give some of the characteristics of 'Arya'. A person who does the things which he is supposed to do i.e. good things, and does not do any bad, can be called Arya.. In short, the one who obeys dharma is Arya. 'Arya' does not reflect any race.

The person with whom we have no relation, but who helps us in our difficult times is our Real relative/brother. In contrast the person who may be our relative/brother (With whom we have blood relations) but who always does bad things for us should not be considered as our relative/brother. Just like a disease which is in our own body does so much harm to us while the medicinal plant which grows in forest far off does so much of good to us!

While fighting with each other, we are five and they are hundred. While fighting with others (enemy) we are hundred plus five.

This are words of yudhiShThIr (dharmarAja). In araNyaparva (i.e. when pANDava were in vanawasa i.e. in jungle for 12 yrs), pandava got a news that kaurava are under attack from gandharvas and were loosing the battle. In fact gandharvas had defeated Kauravas and imprisoned them. That time, bhIma's opinion was, not to help Kaurava, because they were paNDava's enemy. bheema was happy that their job was done by gandharvas. That time yudhiShThIr said that even if Kaurava were enemies, they were their brothers, and paNDava must help them in that crisis.

This is an excellent example laid by yudhiShThIr before us. If we turn our pages of history, many places we find that our rajas were fighting with each other, and they even helped outside invaders to knock down other Indian rajas. And that was major cause of success of invaders.

In todays contex, we must know who is "ours" and who is not.

Friendship of a friend is tested in our bad times, the warrior's heroism is tested in a war, a servant's test lies in his good attitude towards the owner and a donor's test is at the time of drought. The point explained here is that the person who donates wealth/food even at the time of a drought, i.e. at the times when the food is a scarcity, is a real donor. If we do not live up to our expectations at the tough times then there is no use of what we stand for.

Only two types of people are happy in this world. One who are foolish/dull and the others who are very much intelligent and knowledegble. All the other people in between these two limits are the only sufferers. The foolish/dull people do not understand the problem (or cannot grasp the problems) and the intelligent people have the solution for it! And therefore it is only left for the people in between them to keep crying for the problem because having known what it is still they cannot envision the path for it's complete eradication.

Extreme desire should be avoided. but don't throw away desires. We should enjoy self earned wealth with control. This subhashita explains one of the specialties of our culture. You may find two extreme views about life in this world. There are a few groups who think that desire about anything is cause of sorrow in life. And desire causes degradation of a person. So it should be avoided totally. There are some groups which believe that we should try to satisfy all our desires... and that will bring happiness in life. The problem in first case is, it is very difficult to follow. And often these suppressed desires give rise to misbehavior of a person. In second case, it is obvious that, this view is not good for societal interest. Also desires can't be satisfied. if you fulfill one another would arise. Keeping this in mind our Rishis suggested midway between these two. one need not give away desires totally, but try to control them and satisfy them with some limit.

A unwise ('murkha') person hesitates to donate the wealth due to the fear of becoming poor in future. But due to the same fear (of becoming poor in future), a wise person wisely donates his wealth!

See how the same fear causes wise and unwise persons to behave differently! In conclusion the wise person donates his wealth thinking that in future if he becomes poor then he may loose the opportunity to donate. The implied meaning of the suBAshit may be that man should not fear for the transient things like wealth. Today it is there and tomorrow it may not be there. So donate it when you have it!

Subhashit explains how difficult it is to change nature of a person. Everybody must have experienced this. If we find that a person needs to improve in certain thing, and try to explain that to him, may be he will accept it that time. But after some time you will find him back with all his traits. This behaviour is similar to water. water is normally cold. you can heat it to change its this usual properly. But after some time you will find that water is cold again.

What are all the humans doing ultimately? Working to feed themselves (and their family). So even a bird like crow does this! Infact there need not be any more explanation to tell what this suBAshit implies! Just the suBAshit is sufficient!!

(We use ornaments to adorn our body, but there is no ornament comparable to good character.) There is no wealth as satisfaction.

Another is from one article. This is a not a suBAshit as such but as it has good teaching in it we are sending it to the group. In this moving world, whatever moves is enveloped (is prevaded) by God. Therefore, you find your enjoyment (or protect yourself) by offering it to him (i.e. by renunciation) \[To whom does the wealth belong? It belongs to no one\] Be no greedy to what belongs to others. Whatever animate or inanimate objects we witness in this world are the abode of the Almighty. Enjoy it with a sense of renunciation, do not grab, because it belongs to nobody i.e. the resources of the world belong to God and it is for his pleasure that they ought to be used.

The english word 'Religion' is not at all even close to what 'Dharma' is in samskrit language. Other suBAshitas where the word 'Dharma' occurs are SuBAshit Nos. 22,67,80,127,135.

Whatever you have to return back to others or whichever work has to be done by you, please do it in the expected time only (Don't delay too much). If you don't do this in time (You do it late) then the importance of that work vanishes (i.e. the effect of the work if done late will have no impact. Here the impact of the work that is done in time is compared to a sweet drink ('rasa')).

suBAshitkAr says that if you don't do your 'karma' (duties) at proper time then the sweetness of your work's result is lost. 'kaal' (Time) will drink that sweetness!!

Don't wait for any favourable time ('muhurta') at which you will start living good life! The whole point is if you want to lead a good/noble life start NOW! Note that 'dharma' is not religion. Please refer suBAshitas No. 17,22,50,67,140,144 for more explanations of the word 'dharma'.

If human beings are "different" than animals then these things will not give the ultimate joy to any human being.

Explanation:- Srila Vyasadeva is stressing that the most important thing in any book, or mere few sentences of writting, is the purity of the author's intention. Even sadhus, the most exalted men, will apreciate (hear and accept) such texts although they find many discrepancies in them.

Actually the word 'muKhaBhang' applies to both the thorn and the wicked person. When appiled to the wicked person it means you insult that person (and not litellary to hit that person on face!) and when applied to a thorn it means you cut that part of the thorn which is pointed and thus it will not harm anyone. Further the suBAShitkAr says that if you don't have capabilities to do such things then simply leave them aside (You follow a different path!!)

The one who resides in your mind, is not far away even if one is staying far away(physically). (However) The one who doesn’t have place in your heart, is distant even if one is close to you.

Friendship or enmity is a relationship between two persons, and it is decided only on their interests. No person is your friend or enemy if you don't consider your interest..

In the group of thousands of cows, the calf correctly identifies it's mother and comes near it's mother - In the same way the deeds done in the past life correctly gets attached to the person (It's effect cannot be undone). Here suBAshitkAr has compared cow with the 'person' (The one who is doing 'karma') and the previous life deeds ('karmas') with the calf. Just as the cow need not bother that how in thousands of group it's calf will locate her, in the same way a human need not bother about how his/her past life deeds will get attached in the current life! According to the Hindu philosophy the current life that we have got and all the goods and bads in it are due to the effect of our deeds in the past life and the deeds in this life will determine about our next life. So 'plan' your next life!!

Happiness is inside the human-being and not outside. Happiness is not tied with the external entity. Absence of desire is absolute happiness! People become unhappy when they see new/better objects of consumption not in their ownership. So the suBAshitkAr has in simple words told us what are the things that makes one happy or sad. We have to decide if we want to be happy or sad!

And how will one get to live a easy life who is looking for knowledge? suBAshitkAr makes us "understand" that knowledge cannot be gained leading a lavish life-style. Therefore may be in ancient Bharat the 'Gurukula' system was designed in such a way that students in their student life should gain maximum knowledge by staying away from all the pleasures of the materialistic world.

The wealth of the person who does not donate nor use it for his/her own purposes, ultimately gets destroyed. There are so many subhaahitas that tell us not to accumulate wealth! But as Shri. Ramray Kamath has stated in his last e-mail that attachment to money is often hard to resist- it rightly calls for a "sacrifice" in true sense. Please refer to the suBAshitas No. 121, 124, 133, 179 and 189 which give us more guidelines for putting our earned wealth for proper usage!

But when applied to the society or nation it will convey in no uncertain terms that any wrong/insult done, should get a befitting reply. Bharat which has been beaten by the terrorism for so many years could not follow this message.

The way to understand this suBAshita is not by validating our wife, son, friend or country on the above specified parameters but by seeing if we personally have the qualities mentioned by the suBAshitkAr! As for the country it can be said that from the government's point-of-view it is it's duty to see that every person has work and can easily earn his livelihood, but from the citizen's point-of-view it should no doubt be like "Ask not what the country has done for you, but ask what you have done for the country"!

(The work/task which will mean 'proper' usage of time for one person may be the 'waste' for another!) So what exactly to do which will not really mean 'wasting' of time?

One should also have the "Will" to achieve the goal. And thus with a strong will an ant (With inferior capabilities) can keep on moving ahead, but the eagle (With much more superior capabilities) - without any efforts can't even dream to reach near it's goal!

This suBAshita is uttered by Duryodhana. Draupadi asks Duryodhana that what is the reason that inspite having many common things in between Kauravas and Pandavas - (Same family ('kula'), Same Guru Dronacharya, Same pitamaha Bhishmacharya) Kauravas always followed the path of 'adharma' and Pandavas always the path of 'Dharma'?

Duryodhana says, "It's not that I didn't knew what was 'Dharma' and what was 'adharma'. But inspite of knowing what is 'Dharma', I couldn't follow it (It didn't become my habit) and even though I knew what was 'adharma' I couldn't desist from not doing it".

This suBAshita ponits at a very delicate nature of the human mind. Many people know what is right and what is wrong. Still why is it that they still follow the wrong path?! So one has to develop the 'habit' ('pravrutti') of following the righteous path (and not to follow the bad way).

Any intention of Dharmic activity should be absolute and complete from Means through the End.

The working senses are superior to dull matter; mind is higher than the senses; intelligence is still higher than the mind; and he \[the soul\] is even higher than the intelligence. \[The meaning is taken from www.krsna.com\]

Observe the ladder: The matter- Senses - The mind - Intelligence ('buddhi') - The Soul.

Carry your enemy on your shoulders if time is against you. But with first opportunity, destroy your enemy, as earthen vessel is broken on a rock. This subhashit tells us that an enemy is always an enemy. If you are not in position to fight with him, temporarily try to please him. But whenever you get a chance, finish him.

Donkeys are singing song in a weddings of camels. Both are praising each other, (donkeys say) how beautiful (camels are), (camels say) what a pleasant voice (of donkeys. i.e. donkeys are good singers). This is a typical scenario in a gathering of low calibre persons. None of them is of any excellence, but they praise each other, either because they don't know what is excellence, or because they want some mental satisfaction. Now whenever somebody praises you, remember this Subhashit;-)

Getting delighted and feeling friendly by seeing others joys, getting dejected by seeing others sorrows, feeling happiness and satisfied by seeing others good work ('punya karma') and feeling ignorant on the bad deeds of others (Not discussing and thinking only about the bad nature of the person), - such reactions should occur on our own mind.

A short suBAshita with great meaning, which can help any individual to become a better human being!

Background: Chanakya has uttered the above sentences. After Chanakya and Chandragupta established the 'Maurya' dynasty kingdom (defeating the Nand dynasty king), there were some difference of opinions between Chanakya and other ministers of the Kingdom.

Those who wanted to leave me have already left. Those who want to leave me may also do so without any hesitation. But for achieving my objective, that which has helped me and which is stronger than thousands of soldiers - that my intelligence ('buddhi') - let it not leave me!!

See the confidence of Chanakya in himself! Apart from being self-confident, this subhaashita also teaches us that whatever we loose in life it is nothing... But let us not loose good mind/intellect and other noble qualities in ourselves.

“While contemplating the objects of the senses, a person develops attachment for them, and from such attachment lust develops, and from lust anger arises”. The attachment (and hence the desire to attain) for an object develops in the first place by perceiving it through the senses. When such desire is not fulfilled, then there comes anger in the heart (due to frustration of the desire) Therefore the best policy is to not even think about the sense objects and thus live simply and happily. For, the more one thinks, the more one desires; the more one desires, the more one gets frustrated, and the more one gets frustrated, the more one gets angry.

The word 'mama' (Mine) is also a two letter word and thus will lead you to 'mR^ityu' - but the word 'namama' (Not Mine) is a three letter word and will thus lead you to the 'brahma' (The ultimate reality)! Nothing in this world "is mine" - I am not the "owner/creator" of any thing in this world - "idam na mama" (This is not mine) - I am only an care taker or trustee of the so-called things owned by me! One should think and act keeping this in mind.

In contrast the bad ('durjan') people are like berry - only soft from outside, but hard from inside! Just as coconut does not 'look' nice, the 'sajjan' people at first sight may seem to be harsh in their talk and attitude - But in reality their mind is pure. The 'durjan' people may 'look' nice with their sweet talk, but in their minds they will be crooked. What this suBAshita teaches us is that don't be 'nice' and 'good' in your external look - that is not important, but be 'nice'/'good'/'sweet'/'pure' from inside - from your mind. After all beauty is God given - whereas it is in one's hand to make one's mind more and more beautiful!

This is by Dharamaraja in Mahabharata. It tells us how difficult it is to decide what is good or bad. Logic is unstable (i.e. one can draw any conclusions depending on his knowledge and intelligence, and these conclusions may change greatly due to slight changes in available knowledge). Shruti or Veda will give different opinions (different Vedas will have conflicts over an issue). Every Rishi/Muni will have his own opinion, and there is nothing to believe that one is better than another. Philosophy of dharma is very difficult to understand. So, the path followed by great persons, is the right path.

This suBAshita by Maharshi Manu proves the broad mindedness of the Hindu Culture. Ofcourse The 'Dharma' referred here is the 'Yuga-Dharma' and not the 'Sanatan' Dharma. This provision in our culture to frame the new 'Yuga-Dharma' which is relevant for that 'Yuga' (Period) is what has helped our culture to be always relevant in all the 'Yugas'. We don't say that the laws made by some 'great' person/'holy' book - one thousand years ago should be valid and implemented even today! The flowing water is always fresh while the still water develops insects and bacterias!

But this suBAshita is for Listeners! Without the qualities mentioned in the suBAshita, the listener or the seeker cannot really "Realize" or "Live" the Truth/Philosophy that the orator is trying to explain. Even being a Good Listener is so difficult!

In ancient India, there were states called 'gaNarAjya'. These states did not have any king, and were governed by government similar to present democracy. This subhashita is about such gaNarAjya. Whenever unity in unions (societies or gaNarAjya) is broken, they get destroyed, because if they are not united, it is easy for their enemies to conquer them. That's why unions (societies) should always try to be united. We can find many subhashitas in Sanskrit or in other Indian languages that tell us importance of unity in general, and with respect to defence. If we turn pages of our history, we will find that India was, and is, strong in all respects. But, we have a serious lacking, that is devoid of unity, which helps our enemies. Everyone of us should try to help our motherland by uniting our brothers.

If water is added to a vessel drop by drop, it gets filled slowly. Similarly, knowledge, dharma (punnya, virtuous deeds), and wealth are to be earned slowly. This subhashita says that don't ever miss to gain a small amount of knowledge, dharma or wealth, because any small amount actually adds in your treasure.

A servant hates his master if the master is miser and rough in talking. Why doesn't he hate himself as he can not judge who is worthy of serving and who is not? Normally people tend to blame the surroundings for their sufferings. Most of the times the cause of trouble is oneself and not his surroundings.

Salute to the guru, who opens eyes of a person blind due to darkness of ignorance, by knowledge (GYAna). Guru is one of the most honourable personalities in Indian (Hindu) tradition. This Subhashita demonstrates Guru's role in one's life. Difference between an ignorant person and a knowledgeable person is stated as difference between a blind and a person with normal eyesight. Guru is a person who gives sight to otherwise blind person. On the day of Ashaadh pournima (full moon day in Ashaadh month of Hindu calendar), called Guru pournima, Hindu's show their respect to their Guru by sacrificing something for him.

The current era of advertisement (actually, advertising more than what one has) gives exactly opposite message. But our culture, since ancient times, believe in this subhashita. There is more emphasis on 'doing' rather than 'telling' what you did.

Notice that ke and shava have been separated. The word "ka" means water (among several other meanings). Hence ke means â€˜in waterâ€™. pANDava also means fish and kaurava also means crow. Hence the interpretation is: Seeing the corpse (shava) fallen in water, the fish were overjoyed. All the crows, however, started crying .. " O the corpse in water!!"

When a person is having a bad time, to overcome it, he may do something that is ethically wrong, e.g. a person can steal somebody else’s food if he is starving. A cultured person will die - but not do such things.

Any good and positive work to be done cannot be done without facing the hardship. At the moment of actually doing the work we may feel the heat of it! But in future the memories of it will surely give a pleasant and cool experience!

Today's world of advertisement tells us exactly opposite of this. It tells us to attract others by attractive packaging rather than contents. But by attractive packaging, one can only raise expectations, but can not satisfy them.

On your forehead, by Brahma written, is your destiny; That's what decides if you have little or lots of money; It matters not whether you seek in a desert or mountain of gold; Don't kneel and crawl before the rich, don't be pitied, be bold. Just watch the water a pail can get from a well or mighty sea; The source, you go to, makes no difference in a pail's capacity.

It is destiny that determines one becomes wealthy or poor. So, it does not matter where you seek wealth. Therefore, do not go begging or acting servile and pitiably with the rich. It does not matter whether you go to a well or the ocean. The amount of water you can gather depends only on the size of your pail. Reference to destiny here does not imply fatalism,. It indicates the observation by the poet that everything in life is not under one's control , and that even after making one's best efforts, what one can attain in life depends on one's own innate capabilities .Hence the reference to a pail's capacity to hold water.

A person who works for benefit the ruler, is disliked by the people. The one who works for the welfare of the people, is disliked by the ruler. So, it is difficult to find a person who can work for benefit of the both, where he is facing equally strong opposition from both the sides. ( it will be very difficult do something which is liked by both sides, if their interests are clashing.) This Subhashita is suitable for a situation where rulers are not particularly contributing towards the welfare of their subjects, and their actions are primarily driven by their own vested interests.

That 'karma' (action), which does not bound the soul back in the life and death cycle is the real 'karma'. That 'vidyA' (knowledge) which brings liberation to the soul, is the real 'vidyA'. Rest all 'karmas' lead just to hardship and rest all forms of knowledge are nothing but information specalizations (or stamp collection)!

According to our Indian culture, liberation of soul (moksha) is the ultimate aim of life. There are many paths (yoga) towards moksha. One of the them is 'niSkAmakarmayoga' (actions without desire). The one, whose actions are driven by desire, fails to attain moksha. The karma which is driven by desire is binding to soul (i.e. it will add to his pApa (bad deed) or punya (good deed)), and some time later, he will either get reward or penalty for the deed. If the same karma is done without any desire, or if the person performs the karma just as his duty, without claiming its fruits (niShkAmakarma) he does not get any reward or penalty. Those who can practice this for their life, can attain moksha. The vidyA which helps in practicing this niShkAmakarma is real vidya.

But if at all a person does commit sin in such place then it can never be forgived for having polluted the greatness of the place.

When Ravana was forcefully taking away Sita , she had thrown few of her ornaments

in a hope that Rama might see those and make his way to her.

Rama showed these ornaments to Lakshmana and asked if he could recognize those.

At that moment Lakshmana said – “ I do know about Sita’s ear rings nor can I identify any

other ornaments of her.

Being always at her feet to get her blessings, I can only say that this feet chain (nupure)

certainly belongs to her”.

Many salutes to Lakshmana’s such pure devotion!

After getting the boons from King Dasharatha that Bharata be crowned and Rama be sent to forest, Kaikai told Lord Rama that King Dasharatha is not willing to convey the sad message to him. So if Rama is interested in following what King Dasharatha desires only then she can convey the message.

At that moment Rama exclaimed with sorrow and mentioned that he could even jump into the fire on the command of king Dasharatha. So he requested Kaikai mata to order him what King Dasharatha wants. He took oath that he would do whatever King Dasharatha says! Shree Rama never gives his words twice! Therefore he is known to be ek-vachani (If once said, it will be done at any cost).

This really became true after Rama went to exile – King Dashratha left his body in deep sorrow of Rama’s separation.

Sorrow kills ones patience, sorrow makes forget one’s ability to distinguish between good and bad, sorrow takes away all good qualities and thus the sorrow is the biggest enemy of an individual.

Thus one should not give himself/herself in the hands of sorrow.

as shark, Kripa as the speed of the water flow, karna as it’s breakers, Ashwatthama and vikarna

as it’s killer whales and Duryodhana as it’s whirlpools, the river of battle was successfully crossed

by Pandavas, only because their boatman was Lord Krishna.

One cannot guess what a person is going to do. One cannot understand or

Only after people see the sweet fruits as a result of doing such a task then one

recognises such a person’s greatness, who can be rightly called as a ‘Pandit’.

To give an example, Veer Savarkar gave call to Indian youths during second

world war to join British Army. This was the time when ani-British sentiments

amoung the Indians was at it’s peak and many people wondered that how can

such a patriot and a crown of Indian revolutionaries say such thing! But after the

independence people saw the fruits of Veer Savarkar’s appeal. A slave nation having

been deprived of arms for centuries needed experienced soldiers having expertise in

modern arms and ammunitions for building an independent army.

Indian Army General Shri. Thimappa in the post independent India was soldier in

second world war!!

Yaksha asked – “What is weightier (more sustaining) than the earth and what is higher than the sky?

What is swifter than the wind and what is more numerous than grass? “

Yudhisthira replied – “The mother is more sustaining (weightier) than the earth and father is higher

(bestower of more benefits) than the sky. The mind is swifter than the wind and thoughts (of a sorrow stricken mind)

are more numerous than grass.

The earth and sky are often compared to the mother and father in the Vedas. The earth sustains and the sky gives

rain but the mother sustains and nourishes her children with much more care and love and the father also bestows

more benefits on his children.

Background -

Yaksha put forth the following question to Yudhishthira - “Who is the enemy of men difficult to conquer

and what is the endless disease? What is the nature of a good man and what is the nature of a bad man?”.

The above SuBAshita is the answer given by Yudhishthira -

Anger is the enemy of men difficult to conquer and covetousness (greed) is the endless desire.

A good man is one who seeks welfare of all beings and a bad man is one who has no compassion or mercy.

Yaksha had asked Yudhishthira, “What is the news?”

In answer to that Yudhishthira said –

In this frying pan of great illusion (the world), Time is cooking the

Creatures with the fire of the sun having the days and nights as it’s fuel

and the months and seasons constituting it’s ladle. This is news.

Time consumes everything and hence one should utilize the available

little time for his own emancipation. Many people do not realise that they

are gradually being consumed by time and hence that is the news deserving

widest publicity.

After seeing the dead body of her husband Ravana, Mandodari uttered,

“It is said that when the tears of a pati-vrata (a devout wife) drop on the land,

they do not go waste. And this has been proved once again in your case.”

Vrata means that which is strictly followed with utmost devotion and missionary zeal.

Sita, having followed the vrata of being devoted to her Lord Rama, had attained a spritual

and moral depth. And Ravana having captured and tortured such an elevated soul had to

pay for his sin. Mandodari’s wisdom has to appreciated that even in the time of greatest

sorrow she could understand the real cause of her husband’s demise.

The virtuous who partake of what is left over after sacrifice,

are absolved of all sins. Those sinful ones who cook for the sake

of nourishing their body alone eat only sin.

Bhagwan Shree Krishna has highlighted that an individual should not

live only for himself/herself. The message of helping others and doing

some charity is conveyed, which is the utmost need of this hour.

Also note that the word ‘yadnya’ has much more wide meaning other than

only the ritual part of it.

Leave the company of bad and evil at all conditions. Because it will lead to desires

(worldly/bad), from the non fulfillment of these desires, anger and moHa (attachment)

will arise and further in this chain the buddhi (intelligence) will get destroyed and at the

end it will be total destruction. (Refer to suBAshita No. 253)

The bad qualities, even though present in small traces in the human mind, like that of tiny

waves, would eventually get developed in to a big ocean due to the company of bad and

evil people!

The above subhAshit teaches us three things to be learnt from a Donkey.

and those are:

1\. He carries load (meaning he slogs,takes pains..thats

what we also have to do to achive our

objectives)without taking any rest

2\. He doesn't care about cold,hot

weather,monsoon...anything...just does it whatever has

been assigned to him...and (that too with honesty)

3.(and after all this) he is always happy, doesn't

complain about anything.

These three things can be learn from a donkey....

thats what the subhAshitkar says.

The facial expression of Shri. Rama (also his feelings) neither

displayed smile on hearing the good news of his coronation ceremony nor

did it display any dismay on hearing the bad news of his exile. May such a sight of Shri. Rama always do good to us.

It is not at all a simple thing for any ordinary individual to maintain

such a balance of mind on two extremely opposite conditions in life.

Therefore the last two lines of the suBAshita is for a humble devotee

of Shri. Rama who says that “May such a pure sight of Prabhu Shri. Rama

always guide me”.

Salutations to you Oh Poverty!! I am blessed because of you!

Being poor, I can see the whole world but no one else can see me!! (Rather no

one notices poor people).

If someone can think of such kind of philosophy inspite of having to struggle

for basic necessities of life then we can only say that such a person is a

realised soul fit for liberation! But such persons are rare not only in poor

class but across the whole humanity! For us the message to take from this

suBAshita is always try to find some thing good even from the worst.

For defeating Lanka, (Lord Rama) had to walk across the sea. His opponent was (powerful) RavaNa, and his army was of monkeys (All odds were against Rama). Inspite of that Rama killed all the demons. Success of great men depend solely on their own capacities, and not on the means they get to use.
