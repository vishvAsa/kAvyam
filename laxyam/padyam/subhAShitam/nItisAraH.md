\[1\] Here the reference is to the Panchatantra story of the woman who killed a mongoose assuming that it had killed her child. She came to know later that the mongoose had in fact saved the child by killing a snake that was about to bite the child. Thus, she had to grieve on account of her thoughtless action.

\[2\] A kalpa is equal to a day of Brahma the creator. This is equal to 1000 yugas or 432 million human years.

\[3\] Hasta is a unit equal to cubit, a measure of length - equal to 24 angulas or about 18 inches, being the distance between the elbow and the tip of the middle finger

\[4\] A kind of beautiful red blossoms, but without any odour that grow on Palasa tree

Even a virtuous person perishes due to association with the wicked just as the swans that gave refuge to the crows perished because of the evil deeds committed by the crows.
