(1.) Parvati, bathed in her hopes by the Trident-holde: burning, in that manner, the mind-born deity in her presence, cursed her beauty in her heart. for beauty has for its guerdon good fortune as regards (the being liked by) one's beloved. 
(2.) She wished to make her beauty fruitful by austeritles, having recourse to concentration; how else, could she secure the two things such love and a husband of that kind. 
3 Mená, hearing that her daughter, who had set her heart on Girisá, was resolved to practise penance, clasped her to her bosom, and spoke dissuading ber from the difficult practice of asceticism 
(4.) In the house are deities such as the heart would desire what a wide difference is there between austerities and thy body The delicate S'irisha flower can bear the tread of a bee but not that of a bird 
(5.) Menâ, though thus exhorting her daughter, whose desire was Inflexible, could not dissuade her from her resolve: who can make a mind firm in its resolution to achieve a desired object or turn back water (rushing) towards a low ground. 
On one occasion that steady-minded girl, begged of her father, who knew her desire, a residence (permission to dwell) in the forest to perform religious austerities till their fruition, through a friend who was her confidante. 
(7.) Being granted permission by her great father, delighted in a persistence worthy of her, she repaired to a peak, full of peacocks, which came to be known by her na ne ever afterwards among the people. 
She, of never-to-be shaken disposition, having given u; her necklace, which rubbed away the sandal paste (or her breast) by its threads, wore a bark garment, tawny like the morning sun, the close union of which with the buds was 1 revented by the elevated breasts.(29) 
(9.) As her face looked pretty by her decorated tresses so it did by the matted hair also; a lotus does not look beautiful only by the swarms of bees but even by its union with moss. 
(10.) By that string of Munja grass having three threads, which she wore for her penance and which (by its harsh touch) caused her hair to stand erect every moment, was the place of the waistband made red, being fastened there for the first time on that occasion. 
…


(53.) This lady, disdaining all the lords of the four quarters, Mahendra and others, of exalted dignity, seeks a husband in the Trident-holder, who is not to be conquered by charms, as is evinced by his destruction of the mind-born. 
(54.) The arrow of the Flower-bewed god, whose point failed to reach the enemy of the l'uras, being first hurled back with the Hunkára sound, difficult to be borne, struck her in the heart with a cruel blow, although his body had been destroyed. 
(55.) From that time forth, powerfully affected by love, and with her curling tresses whitened by the sandal paste on her forehead, the maiden never felt ease even when reclining on the surfaces, of snow-slabs while in her father's 
house. 
(56.) Many a time did she make the daughters of the Kinnara kings, her companions in the songs sung in the woods, burst into tears, by her words ( of grief) scarcely articulate in the throat choking with tears, while the exploits of the Pináka-holder were being sung. 
(57.) At night, when the third part was still remaining, she could scarcely close her eyes for a moment, when all of a sudden she would start up with incoherent cries of—"O Thou of azure neck, where dost thou go?" and would throw her arms tight round an imaginary neck. 
(58.) 
And He of the cresent-crest, drawn with her own hands by this silly girl, was upbraided in private with the words: Thou hast been considered all-pervading by the wise; how, then, dost thou not know this person, slave to thy love? 
}} 
(59.) When at last she could find no other way to win the Lord of the universe though deliberately searching, she 
( 35 ) 
came with us to this sacred forest for practising austerities permitted by her father. 
(60.) 
This our friend has seen fruit appearing on these trees (planted) (lit. given birth to) by herself and the witnesses of her austerities: and yet the craving of her heart, which has for its basis the moon-crested God, does not seem even to be near sprouting time (about to bear fruit). 
(61.) 
I do not know when he, difficult to be secured :hough sought after, will favour this our friend, worn by penance and looked at by us, her friends, with tears, as Indra favours (with showers) the earth, distressed by his holding off (the rain). 
(62.) Thus informed by her, who knew the secrets of Pârvati's heart, so as to make her noble intention clear, that handsome Brahmacharin, without showing signs of delight, asked Umà whether it was so or a joke. 
(63.) Then the daughter of the mountain, putting the rosary of crystal beads on (or into) her forehand, with the fingers drawn together so as to resemble a bud, spoke, with great difficulty, in measured words, having adjusted her speech (in her mind) for a long time. 
(64.) O thou, worshipped of those who know the Vedas, thou hast heard the truth (lit. as it is); this (humble) These person is ambitious of attaining the highest post. austerities are a means of getting that: nothing is in accessible to desire (fancy). 
(65.) Then said the ascetic-Mahes'wara is well known: and yet thou hast a yearning after him; knowing him possess a love for inauspitious things, I cannot see my way to approve of thy desire. 
(66.) O thou who hast fixed (thy mind) on a worthless object, how can this thy hand with the nuptial string still tied round it, bear the first clasp of S'ambhu's hand decked with circling snakes? 
(67.) Do thou thyself consider adequately whether these two things can ever bear being together the bridal 
+ 
( 36 ) 
silks gleaming with the (figures of) swans and the elephanthide dripping with blood? 
(68.) Who, even an enemy, consent (to see) the footprints, leaving marks of red vermeil of thy feet treading upon flowers in the saloon, traced upon the ground of the dead spread over with hair? 
(69.) Say-Is there any thing more ungainly than this that the ashes of the funeral pyres easy to be obtained from the bosom of the three-eyed God will make their home on thy bosom, a (fitting) place for sandal wood paste? 
(70.) Then again this another humiliation will await thee-great men will have smiling countenances, on seeing thee, fit to be borne by a lordly elephant, striding the bull, after marriage. 
(71.) By their earnest (desire) for union with the Tridentholder, two things have now become objects of commiseration: the digit of the (moon) and thyself, the moonlight of the eyes of the world. 
(72.) His body is (deformed) having monstrous eyes, his descent is obscure (not to be found out), and his wealth is shown by his having the quarters for a garment. O thou having eyes like those of a young gazelle, is whatever expected in a husband found in the three-eyed One, even taken singly? 
(73.) 
Turn thy heart from this evil desire; what a disance is there between one of that kind, and thee with auspicious marks? A gibbet of the burial ground is not expected to be treated with the Vedic rites proper for a sacrificial post, by the good. 
(74.) By her, whose anger could be guessed from her quivering nether lip, were cast askance upon the twiceborn, talking adversely, her eyes, red at the corners, 
with a hown gathered on the creeper like-brows. 
(75.) And him she thus addressed: -"Indeed thou dost not know Hara aright, since thou talkest thus to me. The dullwitted find fault with the course of life of the magnanimous, which is not in common with that of other people, and the motive of which is difficult to divine.” 
( 37 ) 
(76.) Auspicious things are resorted to by one, who is anxious to ward off calamities or to attain prosperity. What has he, who is the protector of the world and has nothing to wish for, to do with these, which corrupt the functions of the mind by generating desires? 
(77.) Himself poor, he is the spring of wealth; living (lit. found) in the cremation ground (the above of the dead) he is the lord of the three worlds; of terrible form he is called S'iva (of gentle aspect). None are there who know the Trident-holder for what he is, 
(78.) The shape of one whose form is the universe can not be determined: It may be resplendent with ornaments or entwined with serpents, dressed in the elephant-hide or again in silken garments, or it may have a vessel of skull or the moon on the crest. 
(79.) Certainly the particles of the ashes of the funeral pyre even become sanctifying by having obtained a touch of his body; and hence are held on the head by the dwellers of heaven when dropped in the act of exhibiting the gestures of dancing. 
(80.) Indra, having for his vehicle the rutting elephant of the (eastern) quarter, touches, with his crest, the feet of that poor God, who goes about on the bull and makes their toes red with the pollen-dust of the full-blown flowers of the heavenly trees. 
(81.) Thou, of depraved soul, although wishing to speak the faults of the Lord, hast said one good thing about him. How can he, who is considered the parent of even the selfexistent Brahmá, have his origin known? 
(82.) Though of disputing let him be, without any reservation, what you have heard him to be, My heart, however, is set on him, pervaded by the one sentimet of love; one, who wants to act as one likes, does not regard (care for) criticism (Ill-talk ). 
(83.) O friend, stop this boy who seems desirous of saying something as his upper lip quivers. Not only he, who talks ill of the mighty, but also he who listens to him is a sinner. 
K. T. 4 
(38) 
(84.) Or rather I will bence; so saying the malden, with the bark garment slipping from her bosom, started and the bull-emblemed God, with a smile, held her having discovered his self. 
(85.) On seeing him, all a-trembling and her body covered with perspiration, the daughter of the Mountain-lord, having one foot raised to tread, was uncertain whether to go or to stay, like a river, hampered by the impediment of a mountain in the path. 
+( 
(86.) O thou of stooping limbs, henceforth I am thy slave bought by thy austerities"-as the Moon-crested God said these words, she forgot all her exhaustion caused by the austertles at once: fatigue gives fresh vigour again by the fruition (the achievement of the desired object ).
