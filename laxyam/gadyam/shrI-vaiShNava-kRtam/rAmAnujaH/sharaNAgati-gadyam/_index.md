This is my translation, though I have benefited from consulting the translation of Ramanujam (2002). For the Sanskrit, I have followed Ramanujam and also consulted Krishnaswami Ayyangar (1976). The following prayer is counted as number 5 in most editions of the Gadyam.

Throughout, I use exclamation points to mark vocatives.
