### Introduction
RaghuVeera Gadyam is one of the many brilliant and moving stotrams composed by Sri
Vedantha Desikan, while he was residing in Thiruvahindrapuram. At this divya desam,
there are the most beautiful Archa murthys of Sri Raamachandra, Sita Devi, and
LakshmaNA. Swami Desikan was thrilled one day by the incomparable beauty of Sri
Raamachandra giving darsanam as Kodhanda Raama at this kshetram and
recollections about the extraordinary valor of our Lord and his deeds on the battlefield
as the MahaVeera at Lanka. Inspired by those thoughts, he summarized in his splendid
Gadyam (work in prose style) the Vaibhavam of this Maha Veera and named it
appropriately Maha Veera Vaibhavam. Later this work came to be known by its popular
name of Raghu Veera Gadyam.
Swami Desikan as a Sarva Tantra Svatantra might also have followed the foot steps of
his PaRaamacharya, Sri Raamanuja, who composed his three master pieces in the
Gadyam form (Sri Vaikunta Gadyam, Saranagathi Gadyam and Sriranga Gadyam).
Swami Desikan was so fascinated by the Gadya Trayams of Sri Raamanuja that he
created a commentary on them known as Gadya Traya Bhashya. This work fits inside
another work of Swami Desikan known as Rahasya Raksha with four chapters.
The first chapter of Rahasya Raksha is the commentary on Saranagathi Gadyam also
known as Prthugadhyam. The second chapter is known as Mitagadhya Bhashyam
consisting of commentaries on both Sriranga and Vaikunta Gadhyams. The subject
matter of Sri Raamanuja's Gadhyams were the important doctrine of Prapatthi and his
supreme devotion to the Archa murthy at Srirangam worshipped by Sri Raamachandra
himself (Sriranga Gadhyam) and the rapturous description of Sri Vaikuntam (Sri
Vaikunta Gadyam), the supreme abode of Sriman Narayana and His consort, the object
2

of our Prapatthi.
It is not an exaggeration to state that Swami Desikan's Raghu Veera Gadyam is his
OWN Prapatthi to the Lord, who declared at Sethu: “It is my solemn covenant that I
stand by anyone who surrenders his all to my keeping. According to this, Vibhishana
comes under my protecting hand, which even Ravana is free to accept. I now charge
Sugreeva to hail Vibhishana and lead him to me”.
“Sri Vibheeshana Sharanaagathi”
It is no wonder that the entire Raamayana is revered as Saranagathi Shastra by Sri
Vaishnavas. In fact, Sri Raamanuja himself learned the special meanings of Srimad
Raamayanam (Saranagathi) from Srisailapurna or Thirumalai Nambi, his uncle, a
native of Thiruppathi. Swami Desikan went on to describe the mystery and sacredness
of Prapatthi in Sanskrit and Manipravala texts such as Saranagathi Deepikai,
Abhayapradanasara, Rahasyatrayasara et al.
We are therefore fully justified in considering the delectable Raghuveera Gadyam of
Swami Desikan as the celebration of the Lord’s covenant to Prapannas housed as the
central message of the seven cantos of Srimad Raamayanam. Swami Desikan
celebrated the veeram or ParakRaamam aspect of Veeraraghavan in this Gadyam. He
went on to celebrate in yet another stotram the valor of this RaNa Pungavan presiding
3

as Archa Murthy at Thiruputkuzhi with the divya namam of Vijaya Raghavan.
Thirumangai Azhwar has performed Mangalasaasanam for Veeraraghavan; the Archa
Murthy at Thiruvellore Divya Desam. Kulasekhara Azhwar celebrated the valor of the
Lord Raamachandra at Tillai Thiruchitrakootam. Saint Thyagaraja saluted his valor at
battle by describing Him as “Dhanda Chathuran” in his Kapi-Naarayani song “Sarasa
Saama Dhana Dhanda Chathura Saati Davamevareh?”. The bard asked “O Raama!
You are adept in statesmanship and in wielding the four expedients, conciliation
(sama), winning over with gifts (Dhana), separating the enemies (Bheda) and
punishing by war (DHANDA). Who is there equal to you?” The saint invited that
Raghuveera affectionately again in his Husseini krithi: “Raghuveera RaNadheera! Raa
Raa, Rajakumara!”
As a part of the essay on Raghuveera Gadyam, adiyEn will cover the following items:

1. When to read Srimad Raamayanam & Raghuveera Gadyam?
2. Where to read Srimad Raamayanam & Raghuveera Gadyam?
3. What are the procedures to follow before Reading either?
4. What are the fruits/benefits of reading either?
5. How do they compare in size and structure?
   Before answering these questions, let us offer our salutations to Lord Raamachandra!

WHEN TO READ SRIMATH RAAMAYANAM & RAGHUVEERA
GADHYAM?
The Aadhi Kaavyam (epic poem) composed by sage Valmiki (Srimad Raamayanam)
consisting of seven books (Khaandas) and 645 Cantos (Sargas) is recommended for
reading in a nine day stretch (Navaaham) or in a 27 day stretch. The nine day reading
with starts and stops at particular chapters is recommended for the months of Chaitra,
Maagha and Kartika during Sukla Paksham (5th day to the thirteenth day). The 27-day
reading is to be carried out starting from the day, when the constellation of Punarvasu
is in ascendance to the day, when Aardhraa constellation is in ascendance. There are
elaborate procedures for reading Srimad Raamayanam (Sankalpam, Acharya
Vandanam, Dhyaanam, Nyaasam (Anganyaasam and Karanyaasam) and Viniyogam
for each of the Khaandams.
The procedures for reciting Swami Desikan's Raghuveera Gadyam are few and simple.
One can recite it every day. One recites at the beginning and ending of the stotram
“NEELA KOMALA RUCHIM RAAMAM BHAJEH SYAAMALAM” (I meditate on Sri
Raama of cerulean hue possessing the soft luster of the blue lotus).
Next, one recites Acharya Dhyanam:
“When to read Srimath Raamayanam?”
5


SRIMATHE NIGAMAANTHA MAHA DESIKAAYA NAMA:
SRIMAAN VENKATANAATHAARYA: KAVITHAARKIKA KESARI

VEDHANTHAACHAARYAVARYOH MEH SANNIDHATTAAM SADHAA HRUDHI  
This is followed by the recitation of the entire Raghuveera Gadyam.
As the conclusion, one salutes again the composer of this stotram:


KAVITHAARKIKA SIMHAAYA KALYAANA GUNASAALINEH I  
SRIMATHEH VENKATESAAYA VEDAANTHAGURAVEH NAMA: II

Finally, the Mangala slokam for Sri Raama is recited:


MANGALAM KOWSALENDRAAYA MAHANEEYA GUNAATHMANEH I  
CHAKRAVARTHI TANUJAAYA SAARVABHOWMAAYA MANGALAM II


### 2. WHERE TO READ?:

One can recite both in front of a SaLagRaama murthy, Tulasi plant and in a temple or
at the puja graham of one's own home. If the recitation is done in front of
SaLagRaamam, one should bathe the Murtham in milk, dry it and then start the
recitation. (Sri M.S. Krishnamachar's monograph released by Visishtaadvaita
PrachariNi sabhaa contains enormous details on the types of SaaLagRaamas. Lakshmi
Narasimha, Lakshmi Narayana, Seetha Raama and Lakshmi Hayagreeva
SaLigRaamams are particularly welcome to be used in the PaarayaNam).

### 3. PURPOSES OF READING:
Those wishing progeny read BalaKhandam; those who seek wealth read Ayodhyaa
Khaandam; those wanting to secure a friend or wishing to secure back lost wealth read
Kishkindhaa Khaandam; those wishing fulfillment of their desires (Kaamyaarthi) read
Sundara Khaandam; Yuddha Khandam is read by those wishing the destruction of their
enemies/obstacles; Uttara Khaandam is read by those who wish liberation from the
cycles of births and deaths (Moksham). This is for reading of the individual
Khaandams of Valmiki Raamayanam. The reading of Raghuveera Gadyam confers all
of the above blessings on the reciter. Both Srimad Raamayanam and Sri Raghuveera
Gadyam are considered as the unsurpassed form of Gayatri Mantram.
4. A COMPARISON OF SIZES:
   Srimad Raamayanam has 7 Khaandams; Sri Raghuveera Gadyam has the summary of 6
   Khaandams and does not include Aaranya Khaandam. You might also note that the
   6

previous section on “Purpose of Reading” omitted Aaranya Khaandam.
Valmiki Raamayanam (VR) has 645 Cantos (Sargams) housed in its six books
(Khaandams); Sri Raghuveera Gadyam has 92 salutations in 6 sections. The Book-byBook comparison is as follows with Raghuveera Gadyam related information in
parenthesis:

- Bala Khaandam ---: VR 77 (18)
- Ayodhyaa Khaandam ---: VR 119 (21)
- Aaranya Khaandam ---: VR 75 (0)
- Kishkindaa Khaandam ---: VR 67 (5)
- Sundara Khaandam ---: VR 68 (1)
- Yuddha Khaandam ---: VR 128 (29)
- Uttara Khaandham ---: VR 111 (18)

(While Valmiki Raamayanam has 645 cantos, Raghuveera Gadhyam has 92 salutations
with the exception of preliminary salutation and concluding portions of Raghuveera
Gadhyam). The Mahavira Vaibhavam or Raghuveera Gadyam summarizes succinctly
the Adi Kavyam of Sage Valmiki revered as Srimad Raamayanam. In 94 Gadya (prose)
passages, Sri Vedantha Desikan addresses Sri Raamachandra and salutes His Anantha
Vaduvur Sri Raamar
7

Kalyana Gunas. If Gopalavimsathi is the home of mellifluous songs in verse form on
Lord Krishna, Raguvira Gadyam is the treasure trove of the “songs” on Sri Raama in
prose form. We meet passages from Raghuveera Gadyam in the eighth act of Swami
Desikan's allegorical play known as Sankalpa Suryodhaya housing the cardinal tenets
of Sri Vaishnavism.
The salutations of the Vaibhavam (Glory) of the greatest of the scion of Raghu begin
with an evocative verse:
JAYATHYAASRITHA SANTHRAASA DHWAANTHA VIDHVAMSANODHAYA:
PRABHAAVAAN SEETHAYAA DEVYAA PARAMVYOMA BHASKARA:
Our Lord, who is the Sun of the PaRaamakasam (Sri Vaikuntam) shines with supreme
effulgence. He took the incarnation as the son of the Emperor Dasaratha to destroy the
darkness (fear) of those, who sought refuge at His feet. He is inseparable from Sita
Devi, just as the disc of Sun is inseparable from its luster. Sri Raamachandra of these
attributes towers over every one through his anantha kalyana gunas (limitless
auspicious attributes).

## COMMENTARY ON SRI RAGHUVEERA GADHYAM

### GENERAL SALUTATIONS:
#### 1:
mhavIr !

MAHAVEERA!  
This Gadhyam derives its name of Maha Veera Vaibhavam from this FIRST salutation.
Swami endearingly addresses Sri Raama, the destroyer of Ravana as the valorous one,
who has no match regarding His heroic deeds in the battlefield.
#### 2:
mhaxIr xaErey ! jy ! jy !

MAHA DHEERA DHOWREYA! JAYA JAYA!  
Hail to thee, Hail to thee, who are in the front row of all known for their courage! In the
last salutation, Sri Raama was hailed as a supreme hero. Here his courage and
steadfastness in the battlefield is saluted. One who overcomes setbacks and fights on in
the face of adversities is said to have the quality of Dhairyam, the key attribute of a
Dheera. Raama is recognized as the supreme Dheera (Maha Deera) here.
“Maha Dheera!”

O Lord, who was accepted and praised by all the Devas, as the one of unsurpassed
valor, as a result of your help to the suffering Devas in the time of their battle with the
Asuraas! Hail to Thee! Hail to Thee!
(Many eons ago, there was a mighty battle between the Devas and the Asuras. The
Devas were routed and prayed for the Lord's help in their hour of distress. He
responded to their call with alacrity and defeated the Asuras soundly. The elated Devas
hailed Him as the Devathidevan and eulogized Him as the one with matchless glory).

DAASARATHI BHAAVA!

O Mighty hero, who took the incarnation as the celebrated son of emperor Dasaratha,
at the pleading of the assembly of the Devas tormented by the ten-headed Ravana! Hail
to thee! Hail to Thee!
(Sarga 15 and 16 of Bala Khaandam is summarized here. Sage Rysyasringa performs an
Atharva Veda Ishti (sacrifice to bless Emperor Dasaratha with male progeny. The
Devas approach Brahma at that very sacrifice and pray to him to destroy the evil
Ravana. Brahma in turn pleads with Vishnu present at the same sacrifice to take the
incarnation of the son of Emperor Dasaratha with the mission of destroying Ravana.
Lord Vishnu agrees to become the son of the Emperor and appears as Prajapati from
the sacrificial pit and hands over to the Emperor a vessel containing Payasam and
commands the Emperor to distribute the contents of the vessel to his wives to beget
progeny. Dasaratha gave half of the Payasam to his eldest wife, Kausalya. She was
blessed then to become the mother of Sri Raamachandra; the other two wives partook
the other portions of the payasam and were blessed with LakshmaNA, Bharata and
Shatrugna. The content of 66 slokas of these two sargas is summarized in six words
here).
#### 5:
idnkr k…l kml idvakr !

DINAKARA KULA KAMALA DIWAKARA!  
Hail to thee, who is the Sun for the lotus of Surya Vamsam!
The Sun makes all the lotuses of the world blossom, as it rises on the eastern horizon.
Sri Raama was born in the solar race (Surya Vamsam). That Vamsam is proud to have
had Sri Raama as its illustrious scion and shines with beauty just like a blossoming
lotus in the morning at the sight of the rising Sun (birth of the Lord). Swami Desikan
equates here the Surya Vamsam to that of a joyous lotus blossoming over the warm
thought of having Sri Raama as one of its most famous descendant. Sri Raama is
recognized as the Divine Sun that makes the lotus of Surya Kulam blossom.
Saint Thyagaraja revered as the incarnation of Adi Kavi Valmiki chose Suryakantam as
a Ragam to set his Krithi “Muddhu Momu”, where he has a reference to the lustre of
Sri Raamachandra's face. He says respectfully: “The Lord's face shone forth with the
11

Tejas of the Sun and was yet, as it always was, captivating like the Moon in its Kanthi, a
rare combination indeed”. He continues on and points out that the all-comprehensive
beauty of Sri Raama confounds the devotees, since they are not able to concentrate on
any aspect of the Lord's beauty by the fact that every aspect is equally fascinating.
Saint Thyagaraja and other Raama Bhakthas following the tradition of Swami Desikan
have saluted the Surya Vamsam in their salutations. Two additional examples that
come to one's mind from Saint Thyagaraja's eulogy of Sri Raama as the scion of Surya
Vamsam are:

DINAMANI VAMSA TILAKA LAAVANYA! DHEENA SARANYA!

(RAGA HARI KAMBHOJI)
And

KAMALAABHDHA KULA KALASAABHDHI CHANDRA

(RAGA BRINDAVANA SAARANGAA)
In the last krithi, the poetic fancy of the Saint goes one step further. He says: “O Lord,
who is the scion of the race of SUN, who is the friend of Lotus! You (in your
captivating nature) are the Moon to the milky ocean, which rises with joy at the sight of
your Moon-like countenance”.
One hears the echo of Saint Thyagaraja's above salutation in Sri Dikshithar's
Manirangu krithi, Maamava Pattabhi Raama in the Charana Vakhyam:

PANKAJA MITRA VAMSA SUDHAAMBHUDHI CHANDRA  
MEDHINI PAALA RAAMACHANDRA.

Here, Sri Dikshithar salutes Sri Pattabhi Raama as the scion of the race that is the
friend of the lotus; he equates that captivating ruler of the world, Raama to the moon
that lifts up the milky ocean.
The central tribute in all these salutations is to Sri Raama's birth in the Surya Vamsam
as its crest jewel (Siroratnam or Tilakam).
#### 6:

DIVISHADHIPATHI RANA SAHACHARANA CHATURA  
DASARATA CHARAAMA RUNA VIMOCHANA!

Hail to thee O Lord, who through your birth liquidated the third debt of your father
Dasaratha, who was famous for his help to Indra in his battles with Asuraas!
12

Here the reference is to the name of our Lord's father, Dasaratha. His valor in driving
his chariot in all the ten directions to chase the enemies of Indra and to come to the
rescue of Indra earned him the name DasaraTa (Dasasu Dikshu Aprathihata Ratha:).
Like all mortals, he had the three debts to discharge. Emperor Dasaratha liquidated
two of the three debts (viz), debt to Munis through Veda Adhyayanam and debt to the
Devas through performance of Yajnaas. One debt however stood out without being
liquidated (viz), debt to the Pitrus. When our Lord incarnated as the son of Dasaratha,
the last debt was liquidated. Hence, our Lord Raamachandra is saluted here as
“Dasaratha ChaRaama Runa Vimochana”.
#### 7:
kaeslsuta k…marÉav kÂ uikt kar[akar !

KOSALASUTHAA KUMARA BHAVA KANCHUKITA KAARANAAKAARA!  
Hail to thee who hid his avathara rahasyam through your birth as the child of queen
Kousalai! O Lord! The entire Universe emanates from you and therefore you are the
root cause for every thing on this universe created, sustained and destroyed by you. Out
of your mere Sankalpa (ideation), You could have destroyed Ravana and removed the
worries of the Devas. You as the Supreme Being hid all of your glories and did garbha
Vaasam in queen Kousaya's womb as a mere mortal child. As a continuation of that
play, you were born on this earth; breast fed at your mother's breast, cried when you
were hungry and played on the sands of Sarayu like an ordinary child. The people of
Ayodhya and the world were unable to understand your divinity and supreme status as
Sriman Narayana as a result of the deeds that you performed as a mere human child.
You thus hid your avathara KaaraNam and Rahasyam.
The Great Raama Bhaktha Kulasekhara saluted this “human child” and hastened in
the same breath to salute the Sarvesvaratvam of the Lord of ThirukkaNNapuram in his
lullabies addressed to Him. Some representative passages are:

MANNU PUKAZH KOUSALAI TAN MANI VAIYRU VAAITTHAVANEH  
TENNILANGAIKKOHN MUDIGAL CHINTHUVITTHAAI

(O Lord who chose to honor the blessed womb of queen Kousalai WITH
UNDIMINISHING FAME, lullaby to you! -- O Lord who shed the ten heads of the
king of southern kingdom of Lanka on the earth in the battle field! Lullaby to you!)

KONGUMALI KARUM KUZHALAAL KOUSALAI TAN KULA MADALAAI  
--- DASARATHAN TAN MAAMADALAAI --DEVARAIYUM


ASURARAIYUM DISAIKALAIYUM PADAITTHAVANEH--  
YEVAR VANCHILAI VALAVAA RAGHAVANEH TALELOH

13

(O Lord who redeemed the kulam of Kousalya known for her perfumed dark tresses by
your incarnation as her child! -- O Daasarathi, the eldest son of emperor Dasaratha!--O
Lord who created the Devas, Asuras and the directions for them to roam around; Oh
Lord with the Bow, adorned with the powerful arrows set to destroy the enemies of your
devotees, who had sought refuge at Your lotus feet-- lullaby to YOU!)
Thus the Kousalyaa Suprajaa Raaman becomes the object of adoration for Swami
Desikan in this seventh Gadya salutation.
Our scriptures in Tamil reveal to us the Avathara Rahasyam of the Lord. Avatharam is
based on the root Avatharathi to descend. He descends from Sri Vaikuntam out of
concern for us, to transform us, the Nitya Samsaaris to Nitya Suris through the act of
Prapatthi thru a proper Acharya. He demonstrates his Sowlabhyam or ease of access,
while he takes the Vibhava Avatharams like Sri Raamachandra. Nammazhwar reveals
that the Lord took the Avatharam not for killing Ravana and other evil-doers, but to
overwhelm us with His charm and Kalyana Gunaas. The Lord could have easily
destroyed Raavana by his Sankalpam alone. He had however other motives to descend
down as Raama. Nammazhwaar states that he became Bhagavat PravaNan as a result
of that Daya and Grace of the Lord. Chandogya Upanishad and Bhattar's commentary
on the Sahasra Namam “Vaamanan” refer to this aspect of the Avathara Rahasyam.
Vaamam means Kalyana Gunas. Since the Lord makes us through His Grace to have
most of those Kalyana Gunas, He is called Vamanan and that Avatharam is
Vaamanaavatharam. Although Raama says that he is only a mere mortal to hide His
Avathara Rahasyam. The Lord, who is Sarvasmaath Paran and Sarva Rakshakan
becomes accessible to us thru Vibhava avathaarams and Archaa State.

KOWMAARA KELI GOPAAYITHA KOUSIKAADHWARA!  
Hail to Thee, who protected the yagam of Sage Viswamitra as if it were a child's play!
Here Swami Desikan pays tribute to the extraordinary valor of Sri Raghavan even as a
small boy. He destroyed the mighty foes of Sage Viswamitra (the Rakshasas and their
leaders, Maricha and Subahu) with effortless ease, when they interfered with the
performance of the sage's Yagam at his hermitage. He sent Maricha spinning in the
sky over enormous distance and dumped him into the ocean and yet spared his life this
time. He killed the other demon Subahu. Sri Raama constructed a canopy of arrows
over the site of the Yagam. Kamban the Illustrious Tamil poet describes the valor of Sri
Raama this way:
14


MANNINAI KAAKINRA MANNAN MAINDHARGAL  
KANNINAI KAAKINRA IMAYIN KAATTHANAR

(The sons of the emperor Dasaratha, who protects the citizens of the earth, protected
the Yagam of Sage Viswamitra like the eyelids protect the eyes).
This act of valor led Sage Viswamitra to praise Sri Raama this way: “I stand
accomplished of my purpose (Kruthaarthosmi), O mighty-armed (Maha Baaho) and
highly illustrious hero, in that the bidding of your Guru (me) has been carried out by
you (Valmiki Raamayanam Sargam 30.26). Kamban salutes Sri Raama as Sundara Villi
(the beautiful one, who handled his bow Kothandam to protect the sacred six day
Yajnam of the inhabitants of SiddhasRaamam and Viswamitra).
Saint Thyagaraja who offered his Satva Sangeetham as his Naivedyam to this
Raghuveeran all his breathing moments sang the praise of the lord in one of his Bowli
Divya nama krithis:

DEENA JANAAVANA SRI RAAMA  
DAANVA HARANA SRI RAAMA


NIRMALA HRUDHAYA SRI RAAMA  
KAARMUKHA BAANA SRI RAAMA


RAGHU KULA TILAKA SRI RAAMA  
BRIGHU SUTHA RUPA SRI RAAMA


DASAMUKA MARDHANA SRI RAAMA  
SIDDHAJANA PRIYA SRI RAAMA


PRASIDDHA CHARITRA SRI RAAMA  
In the last two lines of the salutation, the saint pays tribute to Sri Raama of celebrated
fame as the one dear to the residents of siddhaasRaamam (Tapovanam where Vishnu
once did penance).
In another song, Saint Thyagaraja sitting at he banks of the river Cauveri at
Thiruvayyaru saw with his inner eye (GyanakkaN) the beauty of the heroic Raama
hurling Maricha into the ocean with his arrow (Maanavaasthram). Our Sadguru enjoys
this scene in his Madhyamaavathi krithi:

ALAGALALLA LAATAKAGANI YAARANMUNI YETU PONGENOH  
CHELUVUMEERAGANU MAARICHUNI MADHAMANATHSU VELA

Sage Viswamitra's joy is shared and experienced by Saint of Thiruvayyaru here. He
says: How must have the heart of Sage Viswamira leaped with joy at the sight of the
effortless heroism of Sri Raama when he destroyed the haughtiness of Maaricha. At that
time this Sundara Villi’s face had no strain or pressure or marks of strain (Vikaaram).
He looked so beautiful during this effort of a mighty heroic nature.
15

Swami Desikan celebrated with this Gadya portion, the heroism of the young boy
Raama, who completed the assigned task as if it was a child's game and received the
gratitude of Sage Viswamit r a a n d t h e r e s i d e n t s o f
SiddhaasRaamam.

RANNADWARA DHURYA BHAVYA DIVYAASTHRA BRUNDHA VANDITHA!  
Hail to Thee! O Raghuveera saluted by the assembly of sacred and mighty arrows
waiting humbly for your command to invoke them in the yaga known as the battle.
Here the allusion is to the gift of sacred and powerful arrows/missiles by sage
Viswamitra to Sri Raamachandra at the conclusion of the destruction of ogress Tataka
by him. Impressed by the valor of Raama and pleased with the destruction of the evil
Tatakaa, the gratified Sage imparted to Sri Raama the secret knowledge about the use
of never failing celestial missiles to destroy one's enemies in the battle-fields. The sage
also taught Sri Raama about the recall of these missiles once invoked and set in motion
against a target (Bala KhAndam --sargas 27 & 28).
As the Sage recited the mantras for the missiles, all of them appeared before Sri Raama
in their shining ethereal forms and saluted him humbly and offered their services. Sri
Raama thanked them and commanded them to appear in his mind at the time of
emergency to render assistance. Swami Desikan refers to this incident here.

destruction of the enemies of those, who seek refuge at your feet!
Swami pays tribute to the powerful and mighty shoulders of the Lord engaged in the
battle with the enemies of those, who sought his protection. Swami points out that
those shoulders of the Raghuveeran are unsurpassable in their beauty and majesty.

her sons not tormented until then by anyone.
Here, Swami refers to the killing of Tataka at the command of Sage Viswamitra and the
controlling of the arrogant sons of hers (Maaricha and Subaahu) and making them
powerless to interfere with the Yajna of Sage Viswamitra at SiddhaasRaamam.

This Gadya salutation is one of the two long passages in Bala Khandam providing an
excellent example of the figure of speech known as onomatopoeia, where the rhetorical
effect resulting from reciting merges with the meaning intended. Words flow from the
tongue and mind of Swami Desikan as a result of the blessings of Lord Hayagriva, his
Upasana Murthy. The other passage of Bala Khandam resonant with musical sounds is
the twentieth Gadya salutation dealing with Parasuraama Garva Bhangam.
In the twelfth salutation, Swami Desikan visualizes the Lord of Dance, Siva and the
dancing waves of fast flowing Ganga on His matted Jatai, which is also the home of the
crescent Moon. That small piece of Moon is known for its cool rays (JATA KIRANA)
and Siva is the SAKALA DHARAN (wearer of the crescent moon) on His JATILA
(Matted tresses -Jataa Mudi). He is indeed the Lord of Dance (NATA PATHI -
Nataraajaa). What do we see inside the Jataa (MAKUTA THATA) of this
NATAPATHI? Swami Desikan visualizes the VIBHUTHA SARITH (the celestial
Deva Ganga) there. What is Her name for Fame? She carries the sacred dust of the
Makarantha (pollens) of the lotus feet (Charanaaravindham) of Sriman Narayana and
she becomes thus holiest of holy rivers as a result of that blessing. The reference here is
to her origin as a result of Brahma's washing the feet of TrivikRaama with his
Kamandalu water at the time of those lotus feet reaching Satya Lokam. She removes all
the sins of mortals and Devas, who bathe in her waters. The Lord's Paadha ThuLi is
17

the root cause of her sacredness.
“Ahalya Saapavimochanam” -Thanks www.kamat.com
Now, Swami connects the holiness and redeeming quality of the Makarandha dust
particle originating from the Lord's Paadhaambhujam. That speck of dust fell on the
stone by the side of the road, which was Ahalya, the wife of Sage Gowthamaa. She had
been cursed by her husband for her infidelity and was condemned to stay as a stone
until the dust from Sri Raama's feet came in contact with her stone form. That holy
association with the sacred dust associated with Sri Raama's feet transformed her back
(JAHAT UPALA TANU) to her beautiful form (RUCHIRA TANU) as the beloved wife
of the celebrated sage (PARAAMA MUNI VARA YUVATHI). Ahalya offered her
salutations (YUVATHI NUTA) to Sarveswaran standing in front of her as a young
prince for restoring her form to that of a beautiful woman. Ahalya Saapa Vimochanam
is thus the subject of this salutation. Srimad Valmiki Raamayanam describes that
Ahalya was cursed to be invisible due to her misconduct. Other sources refer to her
form as a stone due to the curse.

Here Swami refers to the many stories that the Sage told to the brothers so that they did
not feel the strain of the journey through the forest. You heard those novel stories with
great intensity and desire. Sage told stories on the origin of Manmathan, history of
Tatakaa, Sriman Naaraayana's incarnation as Vaamana to curb the pride and arrogance
of Mahaa Bali and the history of SiddhaasRaama, Siva Dhanus (Bow) in King Janaka's

O Lord who is the life-giving moon to the beautiful eyes of the women of Mithila
known for the beauty of their eyes! Hail to Thee! Hail to Thee!
As Lord Raamachandra entered the city of Mithilai, the beautiful women feasted on
your beauty just as the legendary chakora birds’ feast on the rays of moon, their only
food. These women felt that the fruits of possessing eyes were realized that day.
Valmiki Raamayanam does not dwell on how the women of Mithilai feasted on the
beauty of Sri Raama with their comely eyes. Poet Kamban however dwells on the scene
that Raama and lakshmana saw on the streets of the city of Janaka. He describes the
beautiful women and the youth of the city as seen by the brothers. Kamban describes at
length the way in which the eyes of Sita and Raama met and how each was affected
deeply by each other's beauty.
AruNachala Kavirayar describes the wonder and bafflement of Sita seeing the divine
beauty of Raama from the balcony of her palace (“YarO Ivar YarO Yenna perO
ariyeneh”) in his Raama Naatakam. This is the famous piece tuned in Raga Bhairavi
by Sangeetha Ratnaakaram Ariyakudi Raamanuja Iyengar.

breaking the powerful bow of Siva. Hail to Thee O Raghuveera, who effortlessly broke
into two the mighty bow of Siva through your matchless strength and heroism!
“Effortlessly breaking Siva’s bow”
It took five thousand men to draw the bow resting in its case to the court of King
Janaka for the competition to string the bow. The winner in that competition was
promised beautiful Sita's hand in marriage by king Janaka. All the kings assembled for
that Svayamvaram failed miserably in the contest. Sri Raama at the behest of Sage
Viswamitra lifted the bow effortlessly and broke it into two, when he tried to string it.
Such was the power of his mighty shoulders (SHOWNDA BHUJADHANDA)!

their friend, the Sun. This DINAAKARA KAMALA KULA DIVAAKARAN had a
special relationship to the lotuses.
20

The Siva Dhanus was broken by now. Sri Raama was assured thus of receiving Sita
Devi's hands in marriage. Sri Raama's joy knew no bounds. His eyes shone with a
special beauty over the thought of being united with His Devi. On that occasion, the
beauty of His eyes mirrored the joy of His “soul as it were and defeated the beauty of
the just blossomed forest of lotus flowers (PUNDARIKA VANA RUCHI).

ParasuraAma was the possessor of a mighty axe that was stronger than the Vajra
weapon of Indra by a hundred fold. He used that to settle his dispute with the
Kshatriyas for the injustice done by the sons of one Kshatriya king by the name of
Kaarthaveerya. ParasuraAma used his axe as the battle weapon to cut asunder twenty
one generations of Kshatriyas and made the earth devoid of Kshatriyas
(AKSHATRAAMIHA SAMTATAKSHA YA IMAAM TRI: SAPTHA KRUTHVA:
KSHITHIM).
ParasuRaama was a proud and angry sage. He had in his possession a bow which had
Vishnu Amsam. It was a very powerful bow. No one could string it except
Parasuraama.
“Sri Raama & Sri ParasuRaama”
When ParasuRaama heard about the feat of Sri Raamachandra in breaking the Siva
Dhanus at King Janaka's court, he shrugged it off as a simple act compared to
stringing the Vishnu Dhanus he had. When Sri Raama was returning to Ayodhya with
His family after wedding Sita Devi, Parasuraama confronted Sri Raama and
challenged Him to prove His valor by stringing the Vishnu Dhanus and fitting it with
an arrow. King Dasaratha pleaded for the safety of his “juvenile” son from the anger of
Parasuraama. Turning a deaf ear to the entreaty of the worried father, Parasuraama
reminded Sri Raama that it is the noble duty of a Kshatriya to accept the challenge of a
warrior (himself here) to a duel in a righteous cause. Parasuraama pointed out that Sri
Raama can qualify himself for such a duel only after stringing the bow of Vishnu and
23

fitting it with an arrow. Sri Raama was indignant over the arrogance of the Brahmin
and took the bow from the hands of ParasuRaama and quickly strung it and fitted it
with an arrow. Then, He asked the Brahmin as to where the arrow should be aimed
since it was unfailing once it was made ready to discharge. ParasuRaama was humbled
and recognized then that Sri Raama is none other than Lord Vishnu. He appealed to Sri
Raama to put an end to his title as one who can move in an unhampered manner over
all the worlds that he won through his severe asceticism. Sri Raama discharged the
arrow to remove the title of Parasuraama and let him retire to Mount Mahendra to
resume his penance. Parasuraama walked clockwise around Sri Raama and went on his
way (Valmiki Raamayanam Sargams 25 and 26 of Baala Khaandam).
Swami Desikan salutes here the Paarameshtyam (the supreme glory of Sri Raama
showing his Lordship over all including the strutting Parasuraama as PaRaamathmaa.
Swami says that the prince of Ayodhya on the occasion of subduing the arrogance of
Parasuraama revealed his svarupam as the PaRaamathmaa to the entire world. Sri
Raama as Sriman Naarayana pulled away the divine power that He had invested earlier
in Parasuraama and reminded him that latter was not a sampoorna Avathara of Him.
In the next Gadhya salutation, Swami Desikan's mind is still occupied with
ParasuRaama and the Extraordinary valor of Sri Raamachandra in subduing the
arrogance of Parasuraama. Swami provides a frame of reference to understand the valor
of Parasuraama first and then goes on describe the mighty arrow of Sri Raamachandra
that put ParasuRaama in place.

JAYA! JAYA!

Swami Desikan's mind is still admiring the valor and kaarunyam of Sri Raama in
dealing with the arrogant outburst of Parasuraama. Hence, he devotes one more (this)
gadhya salutation to Parasuraama Garva bhangam. In this salutation which its musical
echos (Dahnthi Dantha Danthura Dasavadana Dhamana---), Swami gives an
24

introduction to Parasuraama's valor first. Parasuraama destroyed the vamsam of the
mighty king Kaarthaveerya, who at one time defeated the powerful Raavana in battle.
Raavana's valor in the battle was well known. Once he lifted Kailasa Mountain and
shook it. Another time, he humiliated Indra in the battlefield and as a souvenir of that
battle carried the wounds inflicted by the tusks of Indra's elephant, Iraavadham. The
king of Lanka, Raavana of such valor was defeated soundly by Karhtaveeryarjunan.
When the thousand handed Karthaveeryarjunan killed the father of Parasuraama, latter
killed not only the offending king, but he destroyed twenty-one levels of descendants of
Karthaveeryarjunan in revenge. Parasuraama performed Tarpanam for his father from
the vast pond of blood of those Kshatriyas and settled the account. Such was the valor
of Parasuraama! Sri Raamachandra accepted the challenge of Parasuraama and
humbled him with his arrow from fitted to the Vishnu Dhanus. As a result of this
extraordinary and matchless valor displayed by Raamachndra, Parasuraama lost access
to the Punya Lokas that he had earned earlier through his severe asceticism.
Raamachandra's broad arrow resembling the lock for a door put an end to the Sugathi
or auspicious future of Parasuraama. Thus Sri Raamachandra's valor surpassed that of
Raavana, his foe Karthaveerya and his tormentor ParasuRaama unambiguously.
“Sri Raama Sita LakshmaNA returning to Ayodhya– Srimatam”

AYODHYAA KHAANDAM  
There are 119 chapters in Ayodhyaa Khaandam of Sri Vaalmiki RaamayaNam.
Swami Desikan uses 7 salutations in his illustrious Raghu Veera Gadhyam to cover the
highlights of this Khaandam spanning 119 chapters in length.
The first Salutation of this section of Raghu Veera Gadhyam covers the events
described by the first 49 of the 119 chapters of Ayodhya Khandam of Sage valmiki.
Sri Raamachandra has now come home to Ayodhya with his bride. Happy emperor
Dasaratha wants to install Sri Raama as prince regent and transfer the power of
rulership to him.
A hunch-backed maidservant of Queen Kaikeyi (Manthara) hears about the news of the
crowing of Sri Raama and is enraged. She instigates her mistress Queen Kaikeyi to stop
the installation of Raama as the crown prince. Queen Kaikeyi is fond of Raama and
refuses first to interfere. Manthara labors on and succeeds in poisoning the mind of her
mistress. She advises her mistress to ask for two boons that her husband had promised,
but not executed. Manthara eggs on Kaikeyi to ask the emperor Dasaratha through one
boon to banish Raama to the forest and with the other boon to install Bharatha, her
own son, as the crown prince in place of Raama. Kaikeyi is persuaded and agrees to
press the king for the two boons suggested by Manthara.
Now Kaikeyi enters the sulking chamber and waits for her husband rushing to share
with her the happy news of the plans for Raama's installation as crown prince. She asks
her husband to grant her the two boons that he promised earlier for her support in a
difficult battle. She explains then the nature of those two boons.
The emperor is devastated by the request of his queen. Kaikeyi invokes the presence of
Gods as witnesses and presses the heart broken emperor for the twin boons of
banishment of Raama to the forest for 14 years and the crowning of her son Bharatha as
the prince regent in Raama's place. The tormented emperor is shocked by the adamant
queen's wish for these cruel boons. He is caught in the horns of a dharma Sankatam.
He cannot go back on his word about granting two boons and yet he cannot envisage
the granting of the specific boons requested by his queen.
He falls unconscious at the very thought of separation form Sri Raama as a result of the
boon requested by Kaikeyi. The heartless Kaikeyi sends for Raama and announces to
him that the boons that she just received from emperor Dasaratha require him to be
banished to the forest for 14 years. Raama accepts the command of his mother Kaikeyi
26

and states that his father's words will not become false and that he will obey his father's
wish.
The emperor begs his son Raama to take him captive and ascend the throne. Raama
consoles his father and states that he has no great desire to ascend the throne and that
obeying his father's command is of the utmost importance to him. The first salutation
of Swami Desikan in the Ayodhya Khandam section of Raghu Veera Gadhyam refers to
that assertion by Raama that he will not make his father's word false by staying in
Ayodhya and becoming a crown prince. That salutation is as follows:

Hail to Thee, O Raghuveera, who abandoned the position of crown prince of Ayodhya
to fulfill the promise implicit in the boon of your father, who was fear-stricken over the
thought that his word to Kaikeyi would become a lie!
Emperor Dasaratha had no choice. He had to grant his queen the boons that she
demanded. With a broken heart, he had to order Raama's banishment to the forest to
prepare the way for Bharatha's crowning. He was being tormented by the thought that
his son might refuse to obey that command and make his words untrue. He was afraid
of being called a liar, who made false promises to his queen. Raama however welcomed
his father's command and immediately promised to honor the boon given to Kaikeyi.
As a result of that promise to his father, Raama abandoned willingly his legitimate title
to the throne of Ishvaakus.

NISHADA RAJA SOWHRUDHA SOOCHITA SOWSEELYA SAAGARA!  
JAYA! JAYA!

Swami Desikan salutes the Sowsheelyam of Sri Raamachandra here. Sowsheelyam is
the attribute of a great soul, who mixes with people lower than him in status with ease.
Here, Swami refers to the friendship that Raama showed to the Guha, the unlettered
king of hunters residing on the frontier of the nation of Kosala.
27

Guha was a simple chieftain, who roamed in the forest in search of animals to hunt.
Raama was the lord of the Universe and PaRaamathmaa. Inspite of it, Raama displayed
his kalyana Gunam known as Sowsheelyam and became the guest of the hunter of a
much lower status and exchanged oath of friendship. Swami recalls this meeting
between Guha and Raama on the banks of Ganges and hails Raama as the ocean of
Sowsheelyam (Valmiki Raamayanam Sargas 50 to 52).
Hail to Thee! O Raghuveera who through your expression of friendship to the chieftain
of the hunters revealed your vast ocean-like sowseelya quality and easy accessibility by
one and all!

BHARADWAAJA SAASANA PARIGRUHITA VICHITRA CHITRAKOOTA GIRI  
KATAKA TATA RAMYAA VASATHA! JAYA! JAYA!

Meaning:
O Raghu Veera who obeyed the instructions of Sage Bharadwaaja and resided in the
foot hills of Chitrakoota Mountain in a beautiful residence built by LakshmaNaa! Hail
to Thee! Hail to Thee!
Reminiscences:
Sri Raama befriended the king of forest hunters, Guha and enjoyed his hospitality and
displayed His Sowlabhya GuNam through recognizing Guhan as the fourth brother of
His besides LakshmaNA, Bharatha and Satrugnaa. With Guha's help, He crossed the
river Ganga and took leave of him and reached Sage Bharadwaja's aasRaamam on the
other side of the river Yamuna. The sage was surprised to see the royal travellers in
hermit's dresses and inquired about what happened. Learning the circumstances that
led to the royal party's journey through the forest, Sage Bharadhwaajaa instructed
Raama to establish His residence few kilometers from his own AshRaamam at a site
located on the foot hills of the beautiful chitrakoota mountain. Raama obeyed the
sage's command and accepted the kaimkaryam of His brother LakshmaNaa, who
constructed a delightful residence according to the codes of building construction.
Sage Bharadwaja in poet Kamban's words describes the beauty of Chitrakootam as
being more than the loveliness of Indra's svarga Logam (ViNNInum Inithaal, Devar
kai thozhum Chitthirakootam). He points out that Chitrakootam is so sacred that even
the Devas raise their hands in salutation.
28

In an entire section named “Chittirakoota Patalam”, poet Kamban describes the
extraordinary beauty of the mountain, its flora and fauna in a manner similar to the
descriptions found in the 94th sargam of Ayodhyaa Khaandam. Here, Sage Valmiki
presents Raama as the describer of the divine beauty of the Chitrakoota Mountain to
his beloved wife. Sri Raama describes the auspicious peak of Chitrakoota mountain as
“CHITRAKOOTASYA KOOTOAYAM DRUSYATEH SARVATA: SUBHA:”
Thereafter, he states: “If for my part, O Darling Sita, I shall be able to spend this period
of exile extending over 14 years (as though in sport), with You. O Sita and
LakshmaNAa! Adhering to the path trodden by the virtuous and conforming to the
highest discipline imposed by myself, I shall derive joy enhancing the piety of my
race”.

Sri Mutthuswami Dikshitar worshipped Thillai Thiruchittira Kootatthu Govindarajan

with the commentary on the Kulasekhara Azhwaar's paasurams are contained in a book

Thiruchitrakootam.
Azhwaar describes his daasyaa state to the Bhagavathaas of the Emperumaan of Thillai
Thiruchitrakootam this way:
O Raamachandra! I take refuge at the holy feet of the Bhagavathaas, who have
performed SaraNaagathi at your lotus feet. (Pasuram 3)
This earth is indeed sanctified by the movement of those Bhagavathas, who raise their
hands in salutation to Sri Raama of Chitrakootam with their Anjali mudra (Pasuram 5).
I do not consider any kingdom superior to the one of having the lotus feet of the Lord
of Thillai Thiruchitrakootam on my head (Pasuram 7)
29

My mind does not ever forget the Lord of Thillai Thiruchitrakootam. Hence no
inauspiciousness will befall me (Pasuram 9)
O Servants of the Lord! Please recognize the archa murthy staying forever to bless you
as Vaikunta Naathan at Thillai Thiruchitrakootam and eulogize him and perform
Nitya Kaimkaryam to Him and receive His full blessings (Pasuram 10).
Such is the glory of Chitrakootam celebrated by Sage Valmiki, Kulasekhara Azhwaar,
Kamban and Dikshitar.

Musings:
The subject matter covered in sargas 79 to 112 of AyodhyA KhAndam of Srimad
Valmiki RaamayaNam is what Swami Desikan briefly mentions here. The grief
stricken Bharata reaches chitrakootam intent on bringing his elder brother to
AyodhyA and crowns him as the emperor. He is accompanied by his three mothers,
Acharya VasishtA, Sage Jabaali, the members of his army and camp followers. Bharata
leaves his entourage behind and walks with his mothers and Acharya to the
ParNasAla (hut) made up of leafy twigs, where Sri Raama, Sita and LakshmaNa were
“Thiruchithrakootam emperuman”
30

living. Bharatha falls at the feet of his elder brother and begs him to return to AyodhyA
and ascend the throne of IshvAkus, now that Dasartha has ascended to heaven. Raama
faints at the news of his father's passing away and goes to MandAkini riverbank and
performs TarpaNam for his deceased father.
Bharatha implores Raama now fervently to oblige him by ascending the throne of
IshvAkus with the concurrence of his own mother Kaikeyi, who retracts the boon given
to her by her late husband. Bharatha threatens to stay in the forest, if Raama does not
return to AyodhyA. Raama silences his brother with cogent reasons as to why he could
not disavow the pledge he made to his father to relinquish the throne in favor of
Bharata. Now, Sage JabAli takes another approach and uses the theory of Naastikaas
Thirukudanthai Perumal
31

to convince Raama that he should accept the throne. Raama dismisses the arguments
of Sage JabAli as hollow and points out that his line of thinking was against Dhaarmic
principles. Acharya VasishtA now pacifies the angry Raama and commands him to
accept the throne as the eldest son of Emperor Dasaratha. Acharya Vasishta points out
that the Guru is superior to one's parents in rank and that Raama should obey him.
Raama politely, but firmly points out that the parents are indeed superior to one's own
Acharya and insists that he could not break the pledge that he gave to his father.
Bharatha in desperation vows to fast unto death to pressure his resolute brother.
Raama points out that it would be a repugnant step for a KshatriyA to commit suicide
in this fashion. The hopeles Bharata now offers to stay in the forest as a proxy to
Raama so that Raama can return to AyodhyA. The firm Raama dismisses that offer of
Bharatha and points out that the question of proxy comes into the picture only when
one is incapacitated and there is no reason for taking that route. Raama states that he
will return to AyodhyA only after the 14 years of exile as per his promise to his father.
The frustrated Bharatha now places a new PadhukA (sandals) at the feet of Raama
and requests Raama to step on it. Raama accedes to Bharata's request. Bharata swears
in front of all the assembled that he will rule the kingdom as the representative of
Raama Padhuka and will step into fire at the end of the 14 years, if Raama does not
return from exile to accept his kingdom. Raama pledges to return and take over the
kingdom at the end of the period of exile.
This incident at Chitrakootam, where Raama refused to be commanded by any one
including his mothers, Acharya Vasishta, Sage JAbAli and Bharatha is what Swami
Desikan had in mind, when he salutes Raama as
“ANANYA SAASANEEYA! JAYA! JAYA!”

THE STATE OF HELPLESSNESS OF BHARATHA IS VERY MUCH LIKE ALL  
THE RAAMA BHAKTHAS, WHO CAN NOT BEAR TO BE SEPARATED FROM

SRI RAAMACHANDRA.  
The great Raama Bhaktha, the guru of Chatrapathi Sivaji, Samartha Raamdaas (AD
1608-1680) described his feelings over separation from Raama this way in his work
known as Daasabodh:
“I want not wealth, nor wife or rebirths i want not in me the pride of knowledge.
By the path of worship (bhakti) lead me to a life of goodness.
I have no skill of mind, no power of thought, no wisdom or strength of reason.
I am thy ignorant bhakta; give me an understanding heart, O Ram.
I know not how to talk or act. I do not understand my duties.
I am greatly troubled by my relations with men. Give me an understanding heart, O
32

Ram.
As I listen to the explanation of the scriptures, a good thought enters my mind; but it
soon passes away as the time of giving up the fruit arrives.
But what shall i do, O Ram; i am unable to do what I ought.
O Ram! I cannot endure life without thee”.
Saint Thyagaraja, another in the front line of great Raama Bahkthas plaintively pleads
to Sri Raama in his PurnachandrikA krithi, Sri Raama Raama Jagadhaatma Raama, Sri
Raama Raghuraama that Sri Raama, the soul of the Universe should not go away from
him. He says “TVAAM VINA NAANYATRA JAANEH RAAMA, TVAAM VINAA KO
GATHI?” I know nothing beyond you. Without you what refuge is there? Elsewhere,
the Saint points out to Sri RaAma in his Naayaki krithi “Nee Bhajana gaana” that he
has in vain explored fully the Saguna margam, the NirguNa margam, the truth and
falsehood, the six schools and the eight siddhis. He has not found the answers that he
was looking for. He concludes by stating that there is naught but You as the redeemer.
Such is the greatness of Raama Bhakthas, who cannot bear even for a moment to Part

PRANATHA BHARATA MAKUTATATA SUGATITHA  
PAADHUKAAGRYAABHISHEKA NIRVARTHITHA SARVA LOKA YOGA


KSHEMA! JAYA! JAYA!  
Meaning:
O Lord who looked after the Yoga Kshemam of the entire world by placing your
Padhukas snugly on the head of your brother Bharata, who ruled as a representative of
those sacred Padhukas after performing the coronation ceremony (Padhuka
pattAbhishekam ) for them. Hail to Thee! Hail to Thee!
Musings:
The sorrowing Bharata journeyed to Chitrakutam with his mothers and Acharyas. He
begged his brother to accept the kingdom and return to Ayodhya to be coronated as the
king of Kosala desam. Raama refused to accede to the request of his dear brother since
he could not break the pledge that he gave to his father. The heart-broken Bharata fell
at Raama's feet and the compassionate Raama placed his padhukAs on his brother's
head. Bharata carried those PadhukAs on his head back to NandigRaamam and
performed the coronation ceremony for them and ruled the land as the representative as
33

those PadhukAs until Raama returned from his exile after fulfilling his avathara
mission. Swami Desikan states that Raama took care of the welfare and protection
(Yoga Kshemam) of the world through his gracious act of blessing Bharata with his
sacred padhukAs.
The source of sanctity for all holy things is their contact with the Lord. The Padhukas
that bear the weight of the Lord and accompany Him in his journeys are the most
sacred due to their Bhagavad Sambhandam. Swami Desikan composed more than 1000
verses to celebrate the holiness of the Padhukas worshipped by Bharata. In the very
first slokam of PadhukA Sahasram, Swami focuses on their unique ability to protect the
worlds:
SANTHA: SRIRANGA PRUTHVEESA CHARANA THRAANA SEKARAA: I
JAYANTHI BHUVANA THRAANA PADHA PANKAJA RENAVA: II
Meaning:
The blessed ones wearing joyously the Lord's PadhukAs on their head protect the
universe through the power of those sacred PadhukAs. Even the dust particle from the
feet of those blessed souls has the power to protect the people of the universe. Bharata
was the first blessed soul to reveal the power of those Padhukas of the Lord.
SwamiDesikan refers to Bharata's role in the second verse of the Padhuka Sahasram:

BHARAHTAAYA PARAM NAMOASTHU TASMAI  
PRATHAMODHAAHARANAAYA BHAKTHI BHAAJAAM I

YADHUPAJNAMASESHATHA: PRUTHIVYAAM
PRATHITHO RAGHAVA PADHUKAA PRABHAAVA:
Meaning:
The illustrious one, who first wore Sri Raamachandra's PadhukAs on his head, was his
brother Bharata. He conducted the affairs of the state as the representative of those
holy PadhukAs during his brother's exile. This verse salutes Bharatha as the blessed
soul, who illustrated the significance, power and the holiness of the Lord's sandals
through his worship of them. The PadhukA prabhavam (the glory of the Sandals of the
Lord) was established first (PrathamodhaaharaNam) by Bharatha.
The concept of those Padhukaas enquiring about the Yoga Kshemam of the people of
the universe brings one's thoughts to the Sahasra Namam phala sruthi verse:
ANAYAA: CHINTAYANTHO MAAM YEH JANAA: PARYUPAASATEH I

TESHAAM NITYAABHIYUKTHANAAM YOGA KSHEMAM VAHAAMYAHAM II  
Meaning:
Bhagavan Sri Krishna says: “With reference to those who find it impossible to live (like
Bharatha) without thinking of Me, I undertake the responsibility of bringing about
34

their union with me and keeping that union for ever”.

SAAMARTHYA! JAYA! JAYA!

Meaning:
O Lord of incomparable valor whose skills in endowing a mere blade of grass with the
power of Brahmaasthram! You sent that blade of grass from your darbha mattress,
when You were horrified to see the apachaaram done by KAkAsura to your Devi out of
his desire for eating flesh. All the Devas and sages were afraid that the Darbham
consecrated by you to have the power of the mighty BrahmAsthram would land on
them, when KaaakAsuran sought them as refuge. O Lord of such valor! Hail to Thee!
Hail to Thee!
Musings:
KaakAsuran (Crow) was the son of Indran, the king of Devaas. Kaakasuran saw Sita
Devi in Chitrakutam. She was holding the head of Sri Raama on her thigh as he was
taking rest. The crow slowly approached the Jaganmaathaa and took a second peck at
her breast because of his desire for eating flesh. Blood poured out and fell on the
sleeping Raama's head. Sita Devi would not move since she did not want to wake up
Raama by her movement. The contact of the warm blood however woke up Raama and
he sized up the situation immediately.
Raama was outraged by the aparaadham of the crow and he consecrated a blade of
Dharbhaa graas from his bed and directed it at the Crow, which was rushing away out
of fear of Sri Raama. That blade of grass possessing the power of the mighty
Brahmaastram chased the Crow in all the three worlds. The crow sought refuge at his
35

father's feet. Indra was afraid to give protection to his own son for fear of the damage
that will come to him from Raama's arrow (empowered Blade of grass). The Crow flew
off to the abodes of Brahma, Rudraa and sages. None of them wanted to get in the way
of the Brahmaasthram for fear of their own lives. They saluted the power of the Lord's
blade of grass and were awe struck at the event of that blade of grass chasing the guilty
crow across the entire span of the Universes. The arrow chased the Crow with vigor,
when it flew in a direction away from Raama and slowed down, when the Crow flew in
the direction of Raama.

O Lord whose arrow's aim can not be interfered with even by Brahmaa, Rudraa and
Indraa. They could not protect the object of your arrow's target with their power. Hail
to Thee! Hail to Thee!
Musings:
The incident of the Apacharam of KaakAsuran took place in Chitrakutam. There is
however no mention of this incident by Sage Valmiki in the Ayodhyaa Khaandam
verses dealing with the life of the divine couple at Chitrakootam. This incident is
mentioned by Sita Devi in Ashoka Vanam in Sundara Khaandam in her conversations
with Hanuman in the 38 th sargam. She was recalling the anger of Raama at the
“Eththisaiyum uzhanrODi iLaiththu vizhum kaakam”
36

ApachAram of the Crow towards her and was telling Hanuman that she could not
understand how Raama is now indifferent to the heinous act of RAvaNA, who
kidnapped her and held her as a prisoner away from Raama.
She recites at length the incident of the Crow hurting her and Raama's rage at the crow.
Swami Desikan in his Chillarai Rahasyam known as “Abhaya Pradhaana Saaram”
dwells at length on Kakasuran's Aparaadham and Raama's Kaarunyam as SaranAgatha
Rakshakan even in the case of the most undeserving KaakAsuran. Swami Desikan cites
this incident as one of the many (VibhishaNa SaraNaagathi, Samudra Raja
SaraNaagathi et al) to justify his insightful description of Srimad RaamaYaNam as the
SaraNaagathi Saastram.
Kaakasuran ran everywhere in the three worlds and could not escape from the
Brahmaastram of Raama and could not gain the protection of any one to save him from
the wrath of the blade of grass. He fell at the feet of Raama finally and sought his
pardon. Sage Valmiki describes the plight of KaakAsuran and his SaraNaagathi in
Sundara Khandam through Sita's words:
THREEN LOKAAN SAMPARIKRAMYA TAMEVA SARANAM GATHA:
The SaranAgatha RakshaNam of the Lord is beautifully described by the Adi Kavi this
way:
SA THAM NIPATHITHAM BHUMOU SARANYA: SARANAAGATHAM I
VADHAARHAMAPI KAAKUTSTHA: KRUPAYAA PARYAPAALAYATH II
— Sundara Khaandam Sargam 38 verse 34.
The crow had fallen at the feet of the Lord. That crow was fit to be killed (Vadaarhan).
He was begging for his life (PraaNarthi). The Lord gave him the boon of life (PraaNa
Dhaanam). One of the reasons for Raama's saving Kakasuran's life was due to the
presence of the PaRaama KaaruNikatvaam of the Piraatti, who was standing next to
Raama. This is the Rahasyam behind the fulfilment of the SaraNaagathi of Kakaasura
by Raama according to Swami Desikan.

PAADAABHJA BHAKTHI: SATATHAM MAMAASTHU I

O Saranagatha Vatsala Raama! O Bhaktha Vatsala Raghu Naathaa! I am not asking
You for any boon except one. May I be blessed with devotion for your lotus feet always!
This is dear to me my Lord. Please give me this boon. I will be asking you for this boon
again and again.
37

With Padhukaa Dhaanam to Bharathaa, Ayodhyaa khaandam was concluded. Raama
at this time was haunted by the memory of the visit by his brother and his mothers.
Hence, he wanted to leave Chitrakutam. He paid a brief visit to the hermitage of Sage
Atri and his dear wife Anusuyaa. After enjoying their hospitality and staying one night
there, Raama, Sita and LakshmaNA moved on and entered the Dandakaa forest. The
events that happened there are the subject of Aaranya Khaandam. Swami Desikan
summarizes those happenings in 14 brilliant salutations.

DHANDAKAA TAPOVANA JANGAMA PAARIJAATHA! JAYA! JAYA!  
Here Swami Desikan salutes Sri Raamachandra as the abundant boon-giving, celestial
paarijaathaa tree that moved around the Dandakaa forest which was ideal for
performing penance.
Sri Raama entered the Dandakaa forest. The sages performing severe penance there
advised Sri Raama about the atrocities committed by the Rakshasaas that interfered
with their Tapas. Sri Raama came to their rescue and moved from hither to thither in
the forest and protected them from harm's way. These good deeds done by Raama are
described as the equivalent of the boons conferred by the celestial Parijaathaa tree in
Indra's garden.

VIRAADHA HARINA SAARDHOOLA! JAYA! JAYA!  
O Lord who was like a tiger to the deer of Viraadha! Hail to Thee! Hail to Thee!
There was a Gandharvaa by the name of Thumbhuru, who committed Apachaaram to
Kubheraa and was cursed in turn by latter to become a Rakshasa. Viradhaa was
causing a lot of mischief in Dandaka forest and was making the lives of sages
unbearable.
Viradhaa saw Sita with Raama and lifted Sita and began to run deep into the forest.
The brothers followed and engaged Viradhaa in a fierce battle. He could not however
be killed with weapons due to a boon that he had obtained earlier. Raama then asked
LakshmaNaa to dig a big pit and bury him there alive. As he was about to die,
Viradhaa saluted Raama for helping him to get rid of Kubhera's curse and restoring
him his former body. He also advised Raama that the hermitage of a great Rishi by the
name of Sarabhangaa was near by and that Raama should go there. Sarabhanga was
38

waiting for seeing Raama before ascending to Brahma lokam. Raama was greeted by
the sage and obtained Moksham thereafter. The valor of Raama in Dandaka Vanam is
displayed first in the battle with Viradhaa.

The Raghu Veeran's many battles with the Rakshasaas of the fearful Dandakaa Vanam

TRISIRA SIRAS TRITHAYA TIMIRA NIRAASA VAASARA KARA! JAYA! JAYA!  
Lord who resembled a sun in banishing the deep darkness caused by the three heads of
the Rakshasa by the name of Trisiras.
After Viraadha vadham, Raama moves with his brother and wife to the interior of the
deep forest. They visit the hermitages of many sages including that of Agasthyaa.
Latter advises Raama to stay at Panchavati. During this journey Sita requests Raama
not to kill innocent animals of the forest and to observe Ahimsaa. Raama commends
his wife for the counsel and vows to kill only the ogres. They arrive at Panchavati and
LakshmaNaa builds a cottage for Raama and Sita there.
SurpaNakaa arrives at the hermitage and invites Raama to marry her and she insults
Sita. LakshmaNa could not brook that insult and lops the nose and ears of SurpaNakaa
for that offense. She runs in great pain and humiliation and approached her notorious
brother by the name of Kharaa, who lived in Janasthaanam surrounded by an army of
ogres. Kharaa sends first fourteen ogres with his sister to kill Raama and they are all
swiftly dispatched to Yama lokam by Raama. Surpanaka rushes back to her brother and
now Kharaa himself comes for a battle to Panchavati with DhusaNaa and an army of
fourteen thousand ogres. Raama kills off the fourteen thousand night-stalkers first.
Dhushanaa is killed next. Trisiras, one of the major commanders of Kharaa is killed
39

next. Swami Desikan salutes the valor of Raama here in killing the fearsome Trisiras,
who caused so much havoc to the sages of Dandaka Vanam. The next three
salutations are to the Raghuveeran, who killed Kharaa and his retinue of fourteen
thousand soldiers.

witnessing your power as a supreme archer rose to sky level their eulogies to celebrate
Your victory.
DhusaNa was the general of Khara, the brother of SurpaNakA. DhushaNa marched
his army of 14,000 ogres from Janasthanam to Panchavati to attack and kill Raama as
per his Master's orders.
“Surpanakaa invites Raama to marry her” – www.kamat.com

Raama killed first the entire army of 14,000 ogres and confronted DhusaNa in battle.
Raama broke the bow of DhushaNa, killed his charioter as well as his horses and then
lopped off the mace-wielding hand of the ogre and killed him too. All the sages
witnessing this fierce battle were thrilled at the sight of Raama's extraordinary valor
and hailed him as a supreme hero. They filled the sky with thankful salutations to
recognize Raama's victory. Adi Kavi says in this context: “Saadhu Saadhu ithi
Kaakuthstham sarva bhoothAnyapoojayan” (all beings present at the battle field
acclaimed Sri Raama saying “well done! Bravo!). Swami Desikan follows this line of
Srimad RaamAyaNam to state that the assembled rishis made the Vijaya GoshaNam.

battle like a swift wind would break a tall tree into two pieces. Thus in the course of one

you as supreme hero. Your consort also witnessed this fierce battle and was joyous over
your victory. She was thrilled to see your extraordinary skills in the battle field. She was
overwhelmed by her feelings of pride about you and embraced you tightly to
congratulate You on Your victory. At that time your proud chest was covered with the
wounds resulting from the just-ended battle. Your consort’s embrace representing Her

Adi Kavi describes this scene of the expression of Joy and affection by Sita to her
victorious husband. He says: “Seeing her husband, who had made short work of His
enemies and brought happiness to the sages, Sita (a princess of Videha desam) felt
rejoiced and embraced Him. Nay, transported with supreme facility to see the hordes
of ogres killed, the daughter of Janaka felt gratified to find Sri Raama without any
harm. Then closely embracing once more that destroyer of the ogre hordes -- the
daughter of Janaka felt rejoiced, her countenance lit with joy”.

VIKRAAMA YASO LABHA VIKREETHA JEEVITHA GRUDHRARAJA  
DEHA DIDHAKSHAA LAKSHITA BHAKTHAJANA DAAKSHINYA! JAYA! JAYA!

O DayALu, who demonstrated your special attachment to Your devotees through Your
act of performing the final rites for the mortally wounded eagle king JatAyu, who put
his life on line to fight the evil RAvaNA and to foil RAvaNA's attempt to get away with
the kidnapping of SitA dEvi.
Background:
Maricha gets killed by the arrow of Sri Raama. While Raama was away on pursuit of
Maricha, the golden deer, RavaNa arrives at the parNasala of Raama in the guise of an
ascetic. Sita invites him to accept her hospitality. She tells the visitor about her husband
and the reason for their visit to the forest. RavaNa now takes his real form and
expresses his desire to make Sita his chief queen in Lankhaa. Sita is shocked by the
audacity of the insolent and deceitful Visitor. She reproaches RavaNa for his
unrighteous thought.
RavaNa gets angry at her harsh words and forcibly kidnaps her and places her in his
celestial car and begins his travel to his kingdom. The heart-broken Sita wails and calls
all the animals and plants of the forest to tell her consort that she is being borne away
by the evil RAvaNA and for him to come to her rescue. As she was being carried away,
Sita catches sight of the eagle king Jataayu perched on a tree. She addresses JatAyu and
begs him to report her abduction by RAvaNA and to ask her husband to hurry and
Vaduvur Raamar
46

rescue her. Jataayu, the friend of Dasaratha engages RAvaNA in a fierce battle to deter
him form taking Sita away.
JatAyu is mortally wounded in that ferocious battle and lies half dead on ground. Soon,
Raama searching for his missing consort arrives on the scene and learns from JatAyu
about the events that transpired. JatAyu had hung to his life until he could see Raama
and brief him on the terrible events that happened. At the end of his narration, JatAyu
dies. Raama was overcome with inconsolable sorrow over the heroic fight of JatAyu. He
performed the final rites to the dead eagle king, which even his own father Dasaratha
was not privileged to receive. Swami Desikan salutes the Bhaktha Daakshinyam
(Partiality for the Bhakthaas) by Raama.
The first slokam of Swami Desikan's Parmaartha sthuthi salutes Vijayaraaghava
PerumaaL of Thirupputkuzhi divya desam as “Srimadh grudhra sarastheera
PaarijAtha”. The sthala puraaNam states that Raama and LakshmaNaa conducted the
anthima Kriyaas for Jataayu at Thirupputkuzhi (Thiru=sacred; Putkuzhi=hole in the
ground dug for the bird, Jataayu). The site of cremation is recognized today as Jataayu
PushkaraNi (Grudhra Saras). Swami Desikan salutes the valor of Vijaya Raaghavan of
Thiruputtkuzhi by addressing Him affectionately as Aahava Pungan, RaNa Punghan
(the supreme hero in the battles). That RaNa pungavan recognizes the valor shown by
JatAyu and responds to it by performing the final rites and giving Moksham to JatAyu
as a token of his gratitude.

KALPITHA VIBHUDHA BHAAVA KABHANDHAAABHINANDITHA! JAYA!  
JAYA!

Meaning:
Hail to Thee, O Lord who was eulogised by the asura Kabhandhaa, who regained his
erstwhile celestial form as a result of your severing his arms.
(Background): Kabhandhan was an erstwhile Deva, who incurred the displeasure of his
master, Indra. Latter hit him with his Vajra weapon on the head and that led to his
head and neck being sunk inside his torso. Later a sage by the name of sthula Siras
cursed Kabhandhaa for an apachAram and latter became an Asura roaming the forest
of Dandakam with no head, neck, thighs or legs, but just a trunk with mouth and eye in
his chest.
Raama was traveling in that AaraNyam in a south westerly direction in search of His
consort. Kabhandhaa confronted Raama and LakshmaNa and snatched them with his
eight mile long hands. Kabhandhaa's prowess rested in his hands. Therefore Raama
and LakshmaNaa severed the ogre's hands at the shoulder level. Raama cut off the
asura's right hand and LakshmaNa took care of the left. The ogre writhed in pain and
fell on the ground under the feet of Raama. Then he inquired Raama as to who he is
and where he came from. LakshmaNa briefed the fallen Kabhandhaa. Hearing that the
one who maimed him was none other than Sri Raama, Kabhandhaa was ecstatic, since
the curse could only be lifted by Raama's hand. The asura begged Raama to cremate
him so that he can regain his body as a Deva and then help the brothers with his
supersensous knowledge as a Deva about the whereabouts of kidnapped Sita. The
brothers threw the body of Kabhandhaa in a pit and cremated him with due ceremony.
At the end of the cremation, Kabhandhaa transformed into his original celestial form
and counselled the brothers that they should cultivate friendship with the monkey king
Sugreeva to succeed in their efforts to reunite with Sita Devi. Kabhandhaa consoled the
grief stricken Raama and asked him to hasten to Sugriva's hiding place on the banks of
Pampaa Lake near Rishyamukha hill. Prior to his departure from this world as a
celestial being, Kabhandhaa showed the brothers the way to SugreevA's abode and
48

gave them information about the hermitage of Sage Matangaa and took leave of the
brothers.

O Lord who was the witness to the Moksha attainment of Sabari, who through her
devoted service to the assembly of sages of unblemished reputation had all of her
blemishes removed! Hail to Thee! Hail to Thee!
Sabari was an old lady, who lived on the banks of Pampaa River. She spent her life
serving the sages doing penance in that region. This service earned her a vast amount
of PuNyams which in turn destroyed any blemishes that she might have had. She had
started her Bhakthi Yogam in a previous birth and completed that yogam in her next
birth as a resident of Pampaa theeram. When Raama stopped at Pampaa Vanam on his
way to meet Sugreeva, she met Raama and was blessed to have his darsana
soubhagyam to her heart's content. She offered the Lord fruits that she had collected
from the forest with great affection. Then she ascended Sri Vaikuntam right in front of
Raama's eyes. Hence Swami Desikan describes Raama as the witness to Sabari's
Bhagyam.
Srimad RaamayaNam devotes the entire 74th sargam of AaraNya Khaandham to
describe Raama's visit to the asRaamam of Sabari in Matanga Vanam on the banks of
Pampaa River. Valmiki describes Pampaa as a lake. Today's Pampaa is a river where
Aiyappa bhakthaas take a plunge before ascending the Sabari Malai to continue with
their pilgrimage to have the darsanam of Dharma Saasthaa.
49

“Sabari MOksha sAkshi”
Sabari meets Raama and LakshmaNA at her aasRaamam. She had already attained
perfection through Yoga saadhanaa. Raama asks about her welfare and state of
spiritual progress. Sabari replied; “O Raama! The flower of humanity! My asceticism
has become fruitful today and the highest heaven will defenitely fall to my lot, now that
you have been worshipped by me (adhya praapthaa tapa: siddhi: tava samdarsanAn
maya, adhya mE sapalam janma guravasccha sapujithaa: adhya mE spalam taptham
svargascchaiva bhavishyathi). She entered the Agni kuntam after clasping Raama's
lotus feet and ascended to heaven with DivyaabharaNam, celestial garlands and
heavenly raiment. Raama was a witness to this glorious event on the banks of Pampaa.
Saint Thyagaraja celebrates Sabari's bhagyam in two of his krithis. In the MukhAri
krithi “entani nE varNinthunu Sabari Bhaagyamu”, he wonders as to how he can
adequately describe the special blessings that Bhaktha Sabari received from Sri Raama.
Sadguru states that there were many rishi patnis of high stature at Matanga Vanam as a
result of their penance and yet Sri Raama selected Sabari as his hostess and accepted
her hospitality with great affection. Sadguru wonders loud: That great blessed soul
saluted your lotus feet, got rid of her cycles of births and deaths and attained moksham
infront of You. What way can I describe Sabari's unique bhagyam?
50

In a second krithi set in ragam KiraNaavaLi (Paraaku nee kelaraa Raama), Sadguru
Thyagaraja swamigaL is angry at Raama for His indifference to him. Our Sadhguru is
in a mood of Amarsha Rosha Roshokthi. He asks: “Why should You, who are
immanent in the movable and the immovable, be indifferent where I am concerned?
Have I treated You with scant courtesy like Sabari who gave You the leavings of fruits
after she had tasted them or have I, like Guha, given You a bed of leaves without
realising Your status?”. Here Saint Thyagaraja refers to one version of Sabari's
hospitality. According to this version, Sabari checked the ripeness of the fruits that she
collected for Sri Raama. She tasted them and gave only those fruits that she thought
were ripe enough for Sri Raama's use. She gave the Yecchil (left overs) out of her great
desire to give nothing but the best among her collection of fruits. Our Sadguru taunts
Raama and asks Him how Raama ignored him, when he behaved much better than
Sabari. With great DaakshiNyam, Sadguru asks these questions. Saint Thyagaraja's
regards for the exceptional Bhaagyam of Sabari is very clear in his Mukhari Krithi.
Srimad RaamayaNam has no support for the reference of Sabari tasting the fruits first
and offering only those that were fit for Sri Raama's consumption. One another version
of RaamAyaNam is the source of Saint Thyagaraja's reference in his KiraNAvaLi krithi.
We will move next to the salutations of Swami Desikan to the incidents of Kishkindaa
Khaandam.

Sri Raamachandra and his brother LakshmaNa left Sabari's aasRaamam and continued
their journey in the direction suggested by KabhandhA along the banks of PampA
Lake. The monkey king SugrivA was living on the summit of a nearby peak named
Rishyamukha parvatham with his ministers. He was hiding from his brother VAli.
SugrivA caught sight of the two princes in the dresses of hermits and got suspicious.
He got alarmed over the thought that they might have been agents of his brother Vaali
sent to catch him. His minister HanumAn reasoned with SugrivA and assured latter
that the princes could not be the agents of VAli. SugrivA then asked HanumAn to meet
the two travellers to find out the purpose of their visit.
51

HanumAn took the disguise of a mendicant and approached the brothers. He bowed
before them and inquired about them and the purpose of their journey to that forest
area. HanumAn appraised them of SugrivA's plight and advised them that his master
sought the good will of the two princes. Sri Raama was very pleased with the
diplomatic skills and the speech of HanumAn proficient in Vedic diction and spotless
Grammar (VyAkaraNam). This is where the first salutation of KishkindhA Khaandham
of Swami Desikan's Raghu Veera gets its inspiration.
#### 42:

PRABHANJANA TANAYA BHAVUKA BHASHITHA RANJITHA HRUDHYA!  
JAYA! JAYA!

O Lord whose heart was filled with joy over the auspicious and adroit conversation of
HanumAn, the son of Vaayu (prabhanjana)! Hail to Thee! Hail to Thee!
The conversation of HanumAn was rich in Vedic vocabulary and correct in grammar.
Sri Raama was very much taken up by the scholarship and conversational skills of
HanumAn that soothed and charmed his heart. He praised HanumAn's skills as a
diplomat and scholar this way:
O LakshmaNA! It is only those who have studied Rg Veda with an understanding of
the meaning of its Rks as well as Yajur and Sama Veda can speak like this. HnaumAn
has surely studied further the entire range of Sanskrit grammar in many ways as
indicated by his faultless speech. His facial expressions and body movements during
his conversation are exemplary in that there is nothing dissonant or out of place. He
utters a remarkably meaningful, fluent and delightful speech that is pleasing to the
mind. He is indeed a worthy emissary of his king”.
Raama's words of praise are:

NOONAM VYAKARANAM KRUTHSNAM ANENA BAHUDHA SRUTHAM  
URASTHAM KANTAKAM VAKYAM VARTHATE MADHYAMA SVARAM


UCCHARAYATHI KALYANEEM VAACHAM HRUDHAYA HARSHINIM  
Swami Desikan has these passages of praise by Raama in mind, when he saluted
Raghuveeran through his first namaskaraNam in the KishkindA khAnda section.
Hanuman is revered as Nava Vyakarana Pandithan. He had learned the different
versions of grammar from the sun god as a boy. His musical skills as a VeeNa player
arose from his adhyayanam of Sama Vedam.
Saint Thyagaraja in his vasanthavArALi krithi on HanumAn named “pAhi Raama
dhutha jagath prANa kumAra Maam”, refers to Hanumaan”s Veda Saastra naipuNyam
this way in one of the charaNams:
52

“Nava Vyakarana Panditha:”

VEDA SASTRA NIPUNA VARYA! VIMALA CHITTHA SATHATHAM  
KARUNA RASA PARIPURNA! KANCHANADHRI SAMA DEHA!


PARAAMA BHAGAVATHA VARENYA! VARADHA! THYAGARAJA NUTHA!

(Oh HanumAn! You are well versed in Vedas and SaastrAs! You are the best of beings!
Your mind is always pure. Your heart is full of compassion. Your body resembles the
golden mount Meru. You are the foremost of Raama BhakthAs. You are a giver of
boons. Please bless me).
Sri Mutthuswami Dikshithar's kruthi inviting HanumAn to appear in his DhyAnam is
full of reference to the vaibhavam of HanumAn.This kruthi isset in ragam NAttA and
starts majestically: “PavanAthmaja aagaccha, paripurNa svaccha”. In anupallavi,
Dikshithar salutes HanumAn as “Nava VyAkaraNa nipuNa, nava vidhAntha: karaNa”.
In one of the charaNams, Dikshithar pays tribute to HanumAn's skills in Kaavyam and
NAtakam and Vedas this way: “kAvya nAtaka Tosha, Upanishad pada ghosha,
pavanAthmaja aagaccha”.
Purandara Dasa has praised HanumAn's multifaceted talents and heroic deeds in
krithis set in ragAs nAgasvarALi, Riti GowlA, sArangA, KalyANi and Mohanam. For
Purandara Dasa, HanumAn was a very important deity, since he is considered as the
Mukhya prANan in MAdhva sampradhAyam. Dasar salutes HanumAn in his
53

RitigowlA krithi this way:
“MUKHYA PRANA YENNA MOOLA GURUVE

TARANI SUTHA SARANAAGATHI PARATHANTRIKRUTA SWATANTRYA!  
JAYA! JAYA!

Meaning:
Hail to Thee O Lord who who sought refuge in SugreevA, the son of Sun God! You
sought the friendship and help of SugreevA to find and rescue Sita Devi. Through your
act of SaraNaagathi (seeking refuge and help in a state of utter dependence) to
SugreevA, You gave up your independence as the supreme Lord of the Universe and
stood meekly obeying as it were the command of SugreevA.
Background:
Hanuman carried Raama and LakshmaNaa on his shoulders and brought them before
his king, SugreevA. The visitors and the monkey king solemnized their friendship in
front of a sacred fire lit by Hanumaan.
Now SugrivA tells Raama that he will have Sita Devi traced out, wherever she may be
and unite her to Raama. Sugreeva fetches a wrapper containing a piece of jewelery
dropped by Sita from the air as she was being abducted by RAvaNA. Raama is
overcome with grief at the sight of the AbharaNams and shows the jewellery (Armlets,
ear rings and anklets) to his brother, LakshmaNA. The response of LakshmaNA is a
moving one. LakshmaNa says: “Dear brother! Neither do I recognize the armlets nor
do I know the ear-rings, I only recognize the anklets due to my bowing at her feet every
day”. Such is the mahAtmyam of Sowmithri!
The grief-stricken Raama asks for the help of the monkey king to locate the place
where his beloved consort is being held in captivity by the evil RAvaNA. SugreevA
consoles Raama and assures Raama that he will locate RAvaNA and the place where he
is holding Sita in captivity.
54

SugreevA continues and says that he would like to offer Raama a salutary advice in a
spirit of friendship and not in the spirit of moralizing (HITAM VAYASYA BHAVENA
BHRAMI NOPADISAAMI TEH). SugreevA advises Raama that he should not grieve
and accept his friendship. Raama is consoled by the sweet words of SugreevA, wipes is
tears and says meekly: “Please help me. Please command me and point out to me
unreservedly what should be done by me in this effort (MAYAA CHA YADH
ANUSHTEYAM VISRABHDENA TADH UCHYATHAAM). This statement of
Raama (KiskindA KhAndham /canto 7/ verse 20) is the source of Swami Desikan's
salutation about the PARATANTREE KRUTHA SWAATANTRYAM ASPECT OF

THE SARVESWARAN TO SUGREEVA.  
It is amazing how Swami Desikan zeroes in on one half a sloka in a long chapter, where
Adi Kavi Valmiki dwells at length on the meeting between SugreevA and Raama. The
Lord of the universe conversing with SugreevA as a supplicant of his help goes on and
says: “Oh SugreevA! Such a friend like you is difficult to get indeed, particularly at this
time of my adversity. Please help me and tell me what I should do. All your desire will
be accomplished by me even as all seeds sown in a fertile field during the rains will
bear fruit. Never before has a falsehood been uttered by me nor shall I ever utter it. I
solemnly affirm this to you and swear by truth alone (ANRUTHAM
NOKTHAPURVAM MEH NA VAKSHYEH KADHAACHANA, YETHATH TEH
PRATHIJAANAAMI SATYENAIVA SAPAAMYAHAM)”.
This is the reference to the Bhaktha Paaratantryam or the Yathokthakaari aspect of Sri
Raamachandra as revealed to us by Swami Desikan.

DHRUTA GATITHA KAILAASA KOTI VIKATA DUNDHUBHI KANKALA KUTA  
DHOORA VIKSHEPA DAKSHA DAKSHINETARA PAADHANGUSHTA DHARA


CHALANA VISWASTHA SUHRUDHAASAYA! JAYA! JAYA!  
In this long salutation, Swami Desikan seems to suggest the long distance over which
an object was sent flying with a miniscule exercise of the power of Sri Raama's left toe.
Meaning :
O Lord who with the slight movement of the toe of your left foot sent the massive
assembly of the bones of the gigantic Asura by the name of Dhundhubhi flying over a
vast distance and thereby lifted the hope of Sugriva and enhanced his faith in your
prowess to destroy Vaali. Hail to Thee! Hail to Thee!
Background:
During the conversations with Raama, the monkey king SugreevA had some doubts
about the prowess of Raama to match his brother Vaalis strength in battle. SugreevA
narrated the incident of Vaali making short work of the ogre Dhundhubhi, who
challenged him in battle. After killing the ogre, Vaali lifted and hurled the body of
Dhundhubhi. That corpse fell inside the precincts of the hermitage of sage MatangA
(Matanga Vanam) and polluted the sacred site with the blood and body remains. Some
drops of blood fell on the body of the sage himself.
The angry sage cursed the perpetrator of that offense, Vaali, to lose his life, if he ever
entered the precincts of his aasRaamam. SugreevA explained to Raama that Vaali
stayed away from Sage Matanga's hermitage because of that curse and that he
(SugreevA) took refuge there to escape from the torments of his powerful brother.
On hearing that story and sensing SugreevA's doubt about his ability to handle VAli in
battle, Raama playfully kicked the colossal heap of bones of Dhundhubhi with his left
toe. That assembly of bones flew a distance of eighty miles as a result of that kick.
SugreevA had only wanted Raama to show his power and strength by kicking the bones
over a distance of 800 arms length. SugreevA was impressed and yet he had some
lingering doubts. He addressed Raama and pointed out that Dhundhubhi's massive
body with flesh and blood was hurled over a great distance by an exhausted Vaali,
when it was full of flesh and body weight. SugreevA was implying that the shrunken
bones of the demon were no match to the weight of the corpse at the time of Vaali's
hurling it away. Thus SugreevA was questioning whether Raama's strength was a true
match to that of his brother Vaali.
56

SugreevA then pointed out a set of seven gigantic Saal trees that Vaali used to shake to
denude them of their leaves to demonstrate his strength.
SugreevA asked Raama: “O prince of Ayodhyaa! How will you be able to kill my
mighty brother in combat?” LakshmaNaa got angry at the continuing doubt of
SugreevA and asked him as to what more Raama should do to convince him of
Raama's superior strength. SugreevA replied that Vaali used to pierce the seven Saal
trees with a single arrow of his and that he will be convinced of Raama's role as a killer
of his brother, if Raama could pierce even one Saal tree with his arrow. The incident
that followed the request of SugreevA is the subject of Swami Desikan's next salutation
to Raghuveeraa.

ATHI PRUTHULA BAHU VITAPI GIRI DHARANI YUGAPADHUDHAYA  
VIVRUTHA CHITRAPUNKHA VAICHITRYA! JAYA! JAYA!

Meaning:
O Hero whose fast-moving, powerful arrow with marvellous decorations that appeared
at the same time in the seven Saal trees, mountains, earth and the nether world! Hail to
Thee! Hail to Thee!
Background:
When doubting SugreevA requested Raama to demonstrate once again his prowess,
Raama obliged him by sending few arrows at the seven Saal trees. Those arrows moved
like a band of lightning. They pierced the seven Saal trees in a trice and continued on
their way to neighboring mountains in their path and broke the crests of those
mountains, changed their direction and traveled through the nether world
(PaathALam/seventh of the lower worlds) and then returned quickly to their home in
the quiver of Raama. The awe-inspired and terror -stricken SugreevA could not believe
his own eyes about what had transpired. He fell flat in front of the Raghuveeran of
unquestionable veeram and declared that his grief over the ill treatment of Vaali and
doubts about the adequacy of Raama's power to protect him from the wrath of his
brother were completely banished. In the words of Adi Kavi Valmiki, SugreevA said:

TAMADHYAIVA PRIYARTHAM ME VAIRINAM BRAATHRU RUPINAM I  
VAALINAM JAHI KAAKUTHSTHA MAYA BHADDHOYAM ANJALI : II
Meaning:
O the illustrious descendant of Kaakuthstha! Please make short work of my tormentor
57

(enemy) in the form of my brother this day to make me happy (and to release me form
my terror). My palms have been joined together in Anjali mudra (Prayer with folded
palms) for that purpose.
Swami Desikan in one of his Sillarai Rahasyam named Anjali Vaibhavam describes the
power of Anjali as “Praarthanaa poorvaka bharanyaasam of the Akinchanan” (the
saraNaagathi done with the folded hands as a first step for the helpless to seek the
Lord's succor and protection). Swami Desikan goes on to describe Anjali mudrai as
“Pala visesha vyanjaka mudrai” (the gesture that symbolizes special fruits to be
obtained from the Lord). Swami quotes the slokam of VishNu DharmOtthamam which
states unambiguously that the anjali made in front of the Lord quickly helps one to
receive the Lord's immediate attention and lets one become the object of his Dayaa.

KAPIKULAPATHY HRUDHAYA VISALA SILATALA DHARANA DHARUNA  
SILEEMUKHA! JAYA JAYA!

Vaali Vadham is the subject matter of this Gadhyam passage. This is the last of the
salutations to the Raghu Veeran from the incidents described in the KishkindhA
KaaNDam..
Meaning:
Hail to Thee, Oh MahA VeerA, who had the fierce arrow to break apart the broad and
strong granite-like chest of Vaali,
the king of the Monkeys ; Vaali's strength and heroism was feared by RaavaNana
himself. Once RAvaNA wanted to fight with Vaali and Vaali taught RAvaNA a lesson
by pressing latter in his arm pit as he flew to the four oceans to perform his daily
sandhyA vandhanam. The chastised RAvaNA who understood the power of Vaali never
again came near Vaali.
Comments:
Vaali was “Kapi kula Pathy” (the king of the Monkey kingdom). He was
“chathurudhadhi viharaNa chathuran”. (He was powerful enough to fly to and sport in
the four oceans). The reference here is to Vaali's practise of jumping to the four oceans
daily to [erform his sandhyAvandhanam (arghya PradhAnam). Once, when Vaali was
engaged in giving arghya PradhAnam, RaavaNan came from behind and arrogantly
grabbed the shoulders of Vaali and tried to knock him off balance. Angered by the
rudeness of RaavaNan, the mighty valley grabbed RAvaNA and placed him in his
armpit and flew onto the next ocean to continue with his sandhyA vandhanam. After
completing his sandhyA Vandhanam, Vaali returned to Kishkinthai and dropped the
half-dead RaavaNan on the floor. The mighty RaavaNan, who lifted the Kailsa
mountain at one time with his bare hands, ran back with shame to his home in Lankha.
Such was the bhuja Bala parAkRaamam of Vaali. Lord Raamachandra of matchless
valor dispatched Vaali of superior strength to death by tearing apart his mighty chest
with a single arrow. Such is the apAra parAkRaamam of this Raghuveeran!

Raama's power to bless one with every kind of Iswaryam including Moksham is

Meaning:
O Lord, who embraced HanumAn with joy over the good tidings of locating Sita's
place of incarceration by the evil RAvaNA and for bringing back the KaNaiAzhi as
Sita’s token of her love for Raama! Hail to Thee! Hail to Thee! You expressed your
special affection to the successful HanumAn, who jumped over the ocean with great
velocity. That ocean served as a formidable moat for the kingdom of RAvaNA to
prevent anyone from entering the kingdom with ease. You held Hanuman tightly in
your arm for returning safely with good news after setting the city of Lankha on fire
with audacity and giving RAvaNA a taste of things to come. The fire set by HanumAn
spread like wild fire and destroyed a significant section of the capital of RAvaNA. You
were so proud of HanumAn for his heroic deeds that you embraced him affectionately
and through that embrace conferred on him every type of wealth and blessings
(Sarvasva DhAna).

INDHEEVARA DHALA SYAMAM INDHUKOTINIBHAANANAM I  
KANDHARPA KOTI LAVANYAM VANDEHAM RAGHUNANDANAM II

We now come to the Sixth and penultimate canto of Adi Kavi Valmiki”s Srimadh
RaamayaNam, which is known as the Yuddha KhAndham (YK). Here, Sri Raama's
avathAra kAryam is executed and his heroism is fully demonstrated. Hence, the
Gadhyam of Swami Desikan on the Raghu Veeran comes into full focus. The
salutations of Swami Desikan echo here with the battle sounds majestically.
There are a total of 29 salutaions related to YK of Swami Desikan's Raghuveera
Gadhyam. Six of them consist of one or two words. I will reflect on their meanings
later. These six salutations for the sake of listing are: Veera (50) Satya Vratha (51)
SwAmin (75) Raaghava Simha (76), Nishpanna Kruthya (71) and Aparathidhwandwa
Pourusha (61).
60

Some of the salutations are very long and are full of alliterations or Onomatopoeia.
These resonate with the sound and fury of the battle in a majestic fashion and
accompany the DankhAra dwani associated with Sri RaamA's Kodhandam.
The first half of Yuddha KAndham(YK) covers the VibhishaNa SaraNAgathi, Darbha
Sayanam, Sethu Bandhanam and the arrival of Sri Raama, LakshmaNa, Sugreeva, and
HanumAn with the army of monkeys and bears at the capital city of RAvaNA. Swami
Desikan covers these incidents through 8 salutations starting from salutation 48. The
first 39 chapters of YK of Srimadh RaamAyaNam cover these incidents.
The second half of YK consists of 89 sargas in Srimadh Vaalmiki RaamayaNam. Swami
Desikan uses 21 salutations to illustrate RaamA's heroism saluted earlier by Vaalmiki in
his YK. These salutations cover the various battles in which Sri Raama participated,
Indrajith's binding of the Lord and LakshmaNa with naaga Paasam, the service of
Garuda to chase away the serpents, RAvaNA's first battle with Raama and former's
retreat from the battle field, death of RAvaNA at the hands of the victorious Raama,
Mandodhari's lamentation over the loss of her husband, her praise of Raama, the
eulogies of the Devaas and Brahmaa in recognition of the unparalleled heroism of
Raama in the Raama-RAvaNA Yuddham, the resucitation of the monkeys from their
death, reunion with Sita, return to Nandigraam in Pushpaka Vimaanam to meet the
waiting Bharatha and the glorious pattabhishekam of Sri Raama as Chakravarthi.

AHITA SAHODARA RAKSHA: PARIGRAHA VISAMVADHI VIVIDHA SACHIVA

VISRAMBHANA SAMAYA SAMRAMBHA SAMUJJRIMBHITHA SARVESWARA  
BHAAVA! JAYA! JAYA!

O Lord, who revealed your svarupam as the Lord of all Gods during the occasion when
you countered the different arguments of the ministers of SugreevA and energetically
motivated them to drop their objections to accept VibhishaNA as a SaraNAgatha at
Your lotus feet! Hail to Thee! Hail to Thee!
Background:
Sri Raama had learned about the place of incarceration of Sita through HanumAn and
thereafter arrived at the Adhi Jagannatha Kshethram on the sea side (ThiruppullANi)
with the army of monkeys and bears to launch his invasion of Lankhaa. At that time,the
younger brother of RAvaNA known by the name of (VibhishaNa) arrived at that site to
seek the refuge of Raama after failing in his efforts to persuade his brother RAvaNA to
return Sitaa DEvi to her husband and to seek latter's apology. VibhishaNA cried out
from his position in the sky and described his plight to SugreevA this way:
“There is an ogre of evil conduct by the name of RAvaNA, who is the Lord of ogres. I
am his younger brother known by the name of VibhishaNA. My brother kidnapped Sita
from Jansthaanam, killed Jatayu and has incarcerated the helpless Sita. I have
vehemently opposed his despicable deed and asked him to restore Sita to Raama with
apologies. My brother would not listen to me and has discarded my good advice. I have
62

abandoned my sons and wife and have left his court and flown over here to seek refuge
at the feet of Raama. Hence, please let RaghuRaama, who has the prowess to protect
any one in all the three worlds, know quickly that I am here seeking his refuge”.
VibishaNA's exact words are:
TYAKTHVAA PUTRAAMSCCHA DHAARAAMSCCHA RAAGHAVAM SARANAM GATHA : II

NIVEDHAYATHA MAAM KSHIPRAM RAAGHAVAAYA MAHAATHMANE I  
SARVALOKA SARANYAAYA VIBHISHANAM UPASTHITHAM II

Hearing these words of appeal from VibhishaNa, SugreevA was alarmed. He thought
that the brother of RAvaNA might kill all of them including Raama and LakshmaNa
just as an owl would destroy crows. He advised Raama to turn VibhishaNaa away on
the basis of his reasoning that VibhishaNaa was a Rakshasaa by birth and a brother of
an enemy to boot. The other members of SugreevA's retinue with the exception of
Hanumaan doubted VibhishaNaa's sincerity in seeking Raama's refuge. Some of them
felt that he intended harm and therefore should be killed immediately. The ministers of
Sugreeva such as Sarabhaa, JaambhavAn, and Maindhaa suggested intensive
interrogation of VibhishaNaa before taking a decision to accept his plea for protection.
They were really not in favor of listening to VibhishaNaa's soulful cry for help.
Hanuman was the last of the ministers to speak. Valmiki describes Hanuman at this
point as the foremost of counsellors and also as “Samskaara Sampanna:” (One who is
learned from his study of scriptures and Dharma Saastrams). Hanumaan pointed out
brilliantly the fallacies in the arguments of his fellow counsellors and took the position
that Vibhishana should be accepted as a SaraNaagatha. Hanumaan ended his analysis
by stating that Raama is the best judge to decide on the next step and act on whatever
that needed to be done.
Raama was very pleased with the counsel of Hanumaan since he felt the same way
about VibhishaNaa and his plight. Raama was very much moved by the counsel of
monkeys, who had His welfare very much on their minds. He thanked them and then
revealed his Sarveswarathvam by stating that He can not refuse to receive under ANY
circumstances one, who has sought His protection and approached Him in a friendly
manner.
“MITRA BHAAVENA SAMPRAAPTHAM NA THYAJEYAM KATHAMCHANA I
DHOSHO YADHYAPI TASYA SYAATH SATHAAMETHADHAGARHITHAM II”
Meaning:
I can not abandon him, who has sought my protection. Even if there is any concealed
wickedness on the part of the one, who sought my refuge, he has to be accepted and
that acceptance will not be considered as a reprehensible act by good people.
Swami Desikan salutes here the prowess of Sri Raama as the unfailing SaraNaagatha
63

Rakshaka and his power as the supreme Lord of all Gods to fulfill his pledge to provide
the protection to all, who sincerely wished for his protection.
“Thiruvallikkeni Sri Hanuman”
After revealing his Sarveswarathvam through the decalaration of his position that he
can not refuse anyone, who sought his refuge, Raama commands Sugreeva to bring
VibhishaNaa before him. The words of Raama to SugreevA before commanding him
are great ones to reflect upon. Swami Desikan was so moved by them that he saluted
Raghuveeran three times for his courage and firmness in his sworn duty to protect
SaraNaagathas without fail. He saluted Raama as “Sakruth Prapanna Jana
SamrakshaNa Deekshitha! Jaya Jaya (#### 49), Veera! Jaya, Jaya!
(#### 50), and Sathya Vratha! Jaya! Jaya! (#### 51)”.
These great words of Raama spoken for the benefit of SugreevA that elated Swami
Desikan deserve serious study by all of us:
“Be he malevolent or otherwise, this VibhishaNaa is incapable of doing even the
subtlest of mischief to me in any manner. I can, if I wish, destroy with my finger tip all
the ogres, dhanavaas and Yakshaas on earth... In the name of humanity, one should not
strike even an enemy arrived at one's door and sought piteously protection with joined
palms... An enemy seeking protection against his enemies, be he distressed or (even)
proud, should be protected (even) at the cost of one's life by one, who has controlled
his mind... If from fear or folly, or even from desire (of some gain), a man does not
protect a refugee according to his capacity, the sin incurred by him is despised in the
64

world... (nay) if a refugee (who sought protection) perishes before the eyes of the man,
who is capable to protect him, the former (refugee) takes away all his (the would-be
protector's) merit (puNyam)... Such a failure shuts out heaven, brings infamy and puts
an end to one's strength and virility.... I therefore vouchsafe security to all living beings
and to him who comes to me even only once and seeks protection from me, declaring ‘I
am Yours, Please protect me’. That is my vow.”
The key passage in Raama's discussion with SugreevA is as follows:
“SAKRUTHEVA PRAPANNAAYA TAVAASMEETHI CHA YACHATE I
ABHAYAM SARVABHOOTHEBHYO DADHAAMYETHADH VRATHAM MAMA”
These words of SaraNaagatha Rakshaka, Sri Raama spoken at the sea side to SugreevA
and VibhishaNaa and HanumAn and the other monkey counselors should serve as a
beacon for us in our deha Yaatraa on this earth.
Swami Desikan was rightfully moved therefore by this uplifting declaration of Sri
Raama and saluted him as Veera, Satya Vratha and Sakruth Prapanna SamrakshaNa
Deekshitha!
Raama has such prowess that he will not let any Prapanna have fear after performing
SaraNaagathi to him. There is no one who matches the Lord in that display of power
and quickness to rush to the rescue of the Prapanna in distress. That unique vow to
protect the prapannaas moved Swami Desikan to salute Raama as Veeraa. Actually,
Swami chose the name of Mahaa Veera Vaibhavam for this Gadhyam with this fact in
mind.
Swami also saluted Raama as “Sathya Vratha” in this series of salutations. For many
years, Swami Desikan lived at Thiruvahindrapuram. The name of the archaa murthy
there is Achyuthan, Natha Satyan. Achyuthan refers to the Lord's vow not to abandon
anyone, who has sought his refuge. Achyutha is the 101st Sahasra Naamam of VishNu.
Paraasara Bhattar comments on this name Achyuthaa this way: “tEbhya:
PrapannEbhya: na apagatha: Achyutha:” (He is never away from those, who sought
refuge in him”. That is his Deekshaa (Sworn vow) as Satya Vrathaa. The sruthis declare
his Svarupam as Brahman this way: “Satyam Jnaanam anantham Brahmaa”. In
Dasaavathara sthotram, Swami follows this line of thought and describes Raama as the
embodiment of Dharmam (DharmO VigrahavAn) and goes on to focus on His central
kalyANa guNam as “Sarvaavastha sakruth Prapanna Jana SamrakshaNaika vrathee”.
These are the thoughts that echo in his 49th Gadhya salutation: “Sakruth prapanna
Jana SamrakshaNa Deekshitha! Jaya! Jaya!”. He just does not provide RakshaNam, but
he offers SamrakshaNam. He protects the Prapannas very well indeed! He placed
VibhishaNaa not only on the throne of Lankhaa, but he gave him also Sri Ranganatha,
the Ishvaaku Kula Daivam to worship. Even today during every Amaavaasyaa day, he
65

offers his darsanam and shows his beautiful /majestic gait to VibhishaNaa at the Divya
Desam (Ashtaakshari Kshethram) revered as ThirukkaNNapuram.
Such is his Dayaa for the PrapannAs and His Deekshaa to protect them.

Musings on the VibhishaNa SaraNaagathi:
As a PaRaamachaarya, Swami Desikan dwelled extensively on the doctrines of
Prapatthi in many of his sacred works. What Sri Raama said at the sea side to
VibhishaNaa riveted his attention? He elaborated on the SaraNAgathi concepts in his
work known as Abhaya Pradhaana Saaram, where he followed the tradition of Sri
Raamanujaa, Thirumalai Nambhi, who studied intensively and taught the
rahasyaarthaas of SaraNAgathi embedded in the different KhAndAs of VAlmiki
RaamayaNam.
It is generally conceded by our AchaaryAs that Srimadh RaamayaNam is the
SaraNAgathi Saastram. Swami Desikan played a key role in reminding us of this truth.
Adi Kavi Valmiki saw what happened during Raamavatharam through his Dharma
Veeryam and Divya Chakshus (Power of penance and divine insight)and described the
exquisite incidents associated with SaraNAgathi in every KhAndham of his Adhi
Kaavyam.That is why Srimadh RaamayaNam is described as “PuNyam Vedaisccha
Sammitham” (One that enhances our PuNyam and is equivalent to the Vedaas in its
sacredness). It is no wonder that VAlmiki's work is considered as Veda
UpabruhmaNam (A work that elaborates on the principles covered by the VedAs).
The Para Tattva NirNayam (the establishment of the unparalleled superiority) of Sri
Raama is made in Srimadh RaamayaNam through the Abhaya PrAdhAnam given by
Him on many occasions as saluted by Sage Vaalmiki. He establishes Raama as Sarva
VialkshaNa Para Brahmam (One with glories that are distinctly superior to other Gods)
and praises Raama as “Aksharam Brahma Satyam”. This satya Vrathi and
SaraNAgatha rakshaNa deekshitha is hailed as a Veera of an extraordinary caliber. The
distinct and distinguishing principle of Sri Raama is the practice of the Abhaya
PradhAna vara dhaanam principle for those, who approached him even once for
protection independent of their Avasthaa (state of mind or mood). That is His Vratham
as we heard from Swami Desikan through the previous three Gadhyam salutations.
Sri Raama's SaraNyathvam is abundantly covered in the Yuddha KhAndham. All other
66

Gods are described as “Vibhuthi Ekadesam” (one speck of HIS ruling power); where
as Sri Raama is considered the total embodiment of the power principle that offers
SaraNAgathi unfailingly. Brahmaa praises the victorious Raaman in the battle field of
Lankhaa as “saraNyam SaraNam cha tvaam aahu; Divyaa Maharshaya:” (Great sages
like Sanaka consider therefore YOU as the means and the fruit of their endeavours
through performance of their SaraNAgathis). They recognize that they are
“Tadhadheena Padha laabhans” (Those who Acheived their superior positions as a
result of His Dayaa). He is the SaraNyan (Rakshakan, RakshaNa vrathi). That is His
VaseekaraNa Saamarthyam (winning ways to attract us to Him). That SaraNaagathi is
paRaama hitam (the superior and eminently satisfying means and fruit).
Tondaradipodhi describes the paRaama hitam aspect of SaraNAgathi done in a trice
(KshaNa Karthavyam) by PrapannAs this way in one of the Paasurams of ThirumAlai:
“kadaitthalai irundhu vaazhum Sombarai uhatthi pOlum” (O Ranganaatha! You take
great interest even in those lazy ones living around your ramparts at Srirangam. They
were lazy in that they did not make the effort to practise difficult Bhakthi and Jnaana
Yogams. They took the easy route appropriate to their limited strength and performed
Prapatthi at Your lotus feet. You accepted those Prapannaas and treated them as
though they were superior to all the others). Swami Desikan points this out and salutes
the Lord as “Priya-Hita Kaari” (the one, who treats us with affection and benovolence
through the practise of his SaraNAgatha rakshaNa vratham). We, who are ananya
SaraNaas (with no other recourse for protection) become the object of His Abhimaana
Ravana—Thanks www.kamat.com
67

gocharam (the object of his special affection).
Sita Piraatti is the SaraNya Sahadharma ChaariNi of the sarva loka saraNyan. In this
role She counsels the evil-minded RAvaNA in Sundara Khaandham this way:
VIDHITHA: SA HI DHARMAJNA: SARANAAGATHA VATSALA: I

THENA MAITREE BHAVATHU TEH YADHI JEEVITHUMICCHASI II  
PRASADHAYASVA TVAM CHAINAM SARANAGATHA VATSALAM I


MAAM CHAASMAI PRAYATHO BHOOTHVA NIRYAATHAYITHUMARHASI II

(O RAvaNA! If you want to live in this world, befriend Raama, who is well versed in the
doctrines of SaraNAgathi dharmam. He discards the offenses made earlier by those,
who seek his protection and perform SaraNAgathi unto Him. With a pure mind,
beseech His friendship and unite me with Him and make Him happy and as a result
continue to live on this earth).
Piratti's Vaatsalya Paravasam (indebtedness to those who seek Her SaraNAgathi as the
consort of the Lord) has been identified by Parasara Bhattar as being superior to that of
the Lord Himself. Bhattar describes that attribute of her in one of the slokams of GuNa
Ratna Kosam this way:

KAAKAM TAM CHA VIBHISHANAM SARANAMITHYUKTI KSHAMOU RAKSHATHA :
SAA NA: SAANDHRA MAHAAGASA: SUKHAYATHU KSHAANTHISTAVAAKASMIKEEII
Meaning:
O Mother Ranganaayaki! Sahadharma chaariNI of Kaakustha Rangesa! You saved
(protected) the Rakshasis of Ashoka Vanam from the wrath of Hanumaan, even when
they were committing offenses to You. Through this act of Yours, You made the
SaraNAgathi (Abhaya PradhAnam) offered by your lord somewhat inferior to Your own
gesture. Your Lord offered SaraNAgathi to the offending crow and the supplicant
VibhishaNA only AFTER they performed their SaraNAgathi. You out of Your infinite
mercy and affection for the sinners (offenders/ApachAris) protected the rakshasis of
asokha Vanam even as they were threatening You. Therefore Your power of
SaraNAgatha rakshaNam is superior to that of Your consort. May your natural,
causeless --nirhethukam, Avyaaja KaruNaa --compassion protect us!).
“A Wall painting of the yuddham”
The whole seven Khaandhaas of Srimadh RaamayaNam is full of incidents illustrating
the SaraNAgathi Taatparyam (the inner meanings of SaraNAgathi). Swami Desikan's
Abhaya PradhAna Saaram salutes the SaraNAgathi episodes in Baala Khaandham
(Devaas offering their SaraNAgathi and seeking the Sesha Saayee's protecton to save
them from the cruelty of RAvaNA), in Ayodhyaa Khaandham (LakshmaNA's prapatthi
to Sri Raama and Sita together and seeking their protection to serve them in the forest.
Here SaraNAgathi according to the spirit of Dvaya manthram is performed by the
brother (anujaa) of Raamaa. The first portion of Dvaya manthram deals with Prapatthi
and the second portion deals with the fruits of such prapatthi.)
In Ayodhyaa Khandham, we encounter once again SaraNAgathi by the other brother
Bharathaa and his obtainment of the fruit of his prapatthi through the acquisition of Sri
Raama Paadhukaas or Sri Satakopam.
In Aaranya Khaandham, the SaraNAgathi of the sages afflicted by Kara, DhooshaNaa
are accepted by Sri Raama and he protects the sages form the terror of the ogres.
Kaakasura SaraNAgathi also takes place in this Khaandham.
In Kishkindhaa Khaandham, we enjoy learning about Sugreeva SaraNAgathi and Sri
Raama's protection of SugreevA from Vaali.
In Sundara Khaandham, we come across the Abhaya PradhAnam of Sarva Loka
69

SaraNyai to the ogresses that supervised Her incarceration in asokha Vanam.
Yudha Khaandham houses the famous VibhishaNa saraNAgathi. In Uttara
Khaandham, Sri Raama answers the Rakshasaa Maalyavaan and reveals the
rahasyaartham of his SaraNAgatha vratham once again.
It is with all these in mind; Swami Desikan saluted Srimadh RaamayaNam as
SaraNAgathi Vedam. He also identified his work (Abhaya PradhAna Saaram) as the
Upanishad that elaborates on the rahasyaarthams of the Illustrious SaraNAgathi
Vedam, Srimadh RaamayaNam.

PRATHISAYANA BHUMIKA BHOOSHITHA PAYODHI PULINA ! JAYA! JAYA!  
Meaning:
Hail to Thee! O Raghuveera, who beautified the assembly of sands of the beach (at
ThirupullANi) through your lying down on them in a bed of sacred grass in
observance of Your PraayOpvesam! Hail to Thee!
Background:
Facing the ocean that separated him from the kingdom of RAvaNA, Sri
Raamachandra contemplated on the method to cross the Ocean and reach LankA.
VibhishaNa, who had been blessed with SaraNAgathi at the Lord's feet, suggested
that Sri Raama can achieve his objective, if he sought refuge in Samudra Raajan
(Samudram RaagavO RaajA saraNam ganthumarhathi). LakshmaNA and Sugreeva
concurred with VibhishaNA's counsel. Raama accepted their counsels.
He spread blades of sacred grass on the sands of the beach and joined his palms as a
mark of respect to the Sea-God and lay down on that bed of Dharbham (Dharbha
Sayanam) facing eastward. He used his mighty arm as a pillow for his head. The
description of the beauty of that powerful arm of Raghuveeran supporting his head is
enjoyed by Valmiki in many verses of the 21st sargam of Srimadh RaamayaNam.
Swami Desikan refers to these slokAs of Valmiki (slokas 3-8, Sargam 21), when he
salutes Dharbha sayana Raaman's beautiful arms and the heroic posture adopted by
him during his praayOpavesam (To lie on a grass bed with control over one's body,
speech and mind until one achieves the kaarya siddhi). Swami calls this act of the
Lord as Prathisayana BhoomikA or the play acting of PraayOpavesam that was
making the whole sea shore beautiful. As the Lord of the Universe, Raama did not
need to ask for the help or shelter of the Sea-God. Yet, he acted as though he was
asking in the proper way, since he wanted to be consistent with his avathAram as a
70

human being, the son of Dasaratha.
Thirumangai AzhwAr is overcome with the beauty of the Raghuveeran in his Darbha
Sayanam pose and assumes the role of ParakAla Nayaki and in moving paasurams
pours forth his sorrow over separation from her Nayakan. These ThirupullANi
paasurams are drenched with the mood of Vipralambha SringAram.
The name ThirupullANi is derived from Thiru+ Pul+aNai/ThirupullANi (Dharbha
Sayanam). Thiruppul and Thoopul are one and the same name for Dharbham. Swami
Desikan hailing from the village of Thuppul has a natural affection for the beauty of
the Lord resting on Dharbhasayanam at the beach of Aadhi Jagannatha Kshethram
and salutes that beauty of the Lord adorning the sea shore.
I will conclude this posting with the Periya Thirumozhi 9.4.9 verse of Thirumangai
saluting the Dharbha sayana Raaman at ThiruppullANi:
VEDAMUM VELVIYUM VINNUMIRUSUDARUM,
AADHIYUMANANARUL TANTHAVAA NAMAKKU,
PODHALARUM PUNNAI SOOZH PULLANI KAI THOZHUTEN,

ODHAMUM NAANUM URANGAATHIRUNTHENE  
The play act performed by the Lord as though he was a powerless human being- Veda
vedhyE parE pumsi jaathE DasarathAthmajE - was saluted by Swami Desikan as
Prathisayana BhoomikA. Swami had Thirumangai's reminder in mind about that
person (Raama) who declared himself as a mere Maanusha-‘the helpless human
ThiruppullANi Darbha Sayana Raamar
71

being’, pretending as the one needing the help of the Sea-God. Parakaala Nayaki let
out the secret about the true identity of that play actor resting on the beach.
The above Paasuram of Parakaala Nayaki describes and salutes that aadhi purushan
as the aadhAra Purushan, who created the Vedaas, who performs the YaagAs, who
generated the pleasure-giving bhulokam, who caused the birth of the Sun and the
Moon and stays as the primordial God of all Gods saluted by Purusha Sooktham.
Nayaki goes on to say that she stood before Him with anjali mudra seeking His dayaa
and He did not respond. She describes her condition as a state of sleeplessness as a
result of the sorrow over the separation form her Lord. She compares her sleeplessness
to that of the eternally vigilant waves, which also can not take any rest. They heave and
break without rest like her sorrowful heart. Both do not sleep. Such is the
sowndharyam of Darbha Sayana Raaman that Parakaala Nayaki and Swami Desikan
saluted.

JAYA! JAYA!

Meaning:
Hail to You, O Raghuveera, who evaporated the waters of the ocean with the power of
your arrows that resembled the fire which destroys the world at the time of deluge!
Background:
The Sea-God did not understand the significance of your SaraNAgathi to him and
ignored you. You were enraged by his indifference. He would not open a passage for
you and your army to cross the ocean. Then, you aimed frightening arrows at the SeaGod and his territory. Those arrows were more powerful than the assembly of flames
72

that accompany the fire that consume the world and its contents during the time of
MahA PraLayam. They spew forth fire and started their work of evaporating the waters
of the ocean. Even then, the Sea-God did not appear before you. Angered further by
this affront, you aimed the most destructive BrahmAsthram at him to destroy him and
the denizens of his watery kingdom. Now, the Sea-God was seized with fear about his
folly and the impending calamity. He rose out of the ocean and with joined palms
appealed to you, the RaghuveerA to spare him and apologized. The Sea-God agreed to
your request for a bridge to be built to cross over to LankA.
Raama still had the powerful arrow in position to fly. He asked the Sea-God as to where
he should direct that arrow. The Sea-God suggested that it should be aimed at a group
of sinful marauders living to the north of where they were standing. Sri Raama let his
arrow fly to where the Sea-God suggested, which is close to today's MarwAr and
Bikaner in RajasthAn. Water gushed forth from the nether world. The power of the
arrow dried up the sea there and replaced it with water from the nether world, which
resembled sea water in brackishness. Raama blessed that land to become a charming
region, now that the sinful marauders were destroyed.
The Sea-God (VaruNA) suggested that the glorious son of Viswakarma (the celestial
“The sea-god agreed to your request for a bridge to be built”
73

architect) by the name of NaLA, a commander in the monkey army of SugreevA build
the bridge over him and that he will sustain and support it. NaLA agreed to the
command of Sri Raama to build the Raama Sethu over the abode of the Sea-God.

Meaning:
O mighty hero of the scion of Raghus, who created the demarcation of the ocean with
your bridge built by the mighty monkeys, who out of their eagerness to reach LankA to
fight their enemies splintered huge mountains and threw them into the ocean as
though they were feathery bales of cotton! Hail to Thee! Hail to Thee!
Background:
After the Sea-God gave the permission for the bridge to be built by NaLA; latter
requested the powerful monkeys to collect the material for the building of the bridge.
Directed by Raama, the monkeys went into the forests nearby and tore up rocks and
trees and dragged them to the beach.
“The monkeys building the bridge” – Thanks www.kamat.com
74

They threw the assembled material as suggested by NaLA at the right places, to
construct the bridge. A well-constructed, magnificient, extensive, smooth and solidlycemented sethu arose from these efforts and the vast bridge across the ocean looked
like the parting of a woman's hair. Sri Valmiki's description is as follows:
VISALA: SUKRUTHA: SRIMAN SUBHUMI: SUSAMAHITA:
ASOBHATHA MAHAN SETHU: SEEMANTHA IVA SAGARE
VibishaNa guarded the front of the bridge from the land and SugreevA requested
Raama and LakshmaNa to mount HanumAn's and Angadha’s shoulders to travel
across the newly built bridge. The rest of the army headed by SughreevA followed
Raama and LakshmaNa reached the other shore and arrived at LankA. The Devaas
who witnessed that miraculous building of a bridge across the ocean hailed the Lord
and wished him victory in the forthcoming battle with RAvaNA this way:
“ JAYASVA SATHROON NARADEVA MEDHINEEM SASAAGARAM
PAALAYA SAASVATHI SAMAA:”
Meaning:
“O King! Conquer your enemies and rule over the earth including the oceans for
numberless years!” Thus ends the twenty-second canto of Srimad RaamayaNam of
sage Vaalmiki.

Meaning:
O Acharyaa (Desikaa), who appeared as though you were the dance instructor for the
ladies of the harem of RAvaNA, when their bodies were shaking from intense fear over
the siege, lay on their beloved city by the swift-moving army of monkeys. Your
instruction came in the form of the mighty roar emanating from the pulling of the
chord of your bow on top of the SuvelA Mountain.
75

Background:
Raama and his simian army with VibhishaNA and LakshmaNa traveled across the
marvelous bridge built by NalA and reached Lankha. The powerful monkeys briskly
moved around to commence their siege of the capitol of RAvaNA. The impending
calamity was clearly understood by the residents of RAvaNA's harem. Their bodies
began to shake out of fear over what was yet to come. During that occasion, the
uncontrollable tremor of their bodies appeared to have its own rhythm as though they
were dancing to the tune of a master dance instructor, who had his own unique tune
and thALam. The mighty sound arising from the twanging of the Chord of Kodhandam
of Raama served as the tune and kept the TaaLam for their ‘dance’. Raama in Swami
Desikan's kalpanai appeared like the erudite NatyAchaarya behind the ‘dance
performance’ of the ladies of the harem of RAvaNA.
One can sense the rapid movements (Dhrutha Gathi) of the excited monkeys (Taru
Mruga/ animals of the tree) during their efforts to lay siege on LankA. The shakes that
took over the ladies of the harem are equated to a playful dance performance (Laasya
Leela) by Swami Desikan. He chose the word Laasya for the dance of the Ladies to
contrast it with TaandavA, the dance associated with males. One can hear the Upadesa
Gosham of the Desikaa (Sri Raama), who taught them as it were the steps for that
dance rooted in terror.

GAGANA CHARA KANAKA GIRI GARIMA DHARA NIGAMAMAYA NIJA  
GARUDA GARUDHANILA LAVA GALITHA VISHA VADHANA SARA


KADHANA! JAYA! JAYA!  
Meaning:
Hail to thee! O Raghuveera, whose sufferings from the tips of the poisonous
NagAsthrams were chased away by the slight breeze associated with the wings of your
friend Garudan, who has the reputation both as the embodiment of the Vedas as well
as the mighty Meru mountain flying in the skies! Hail to Thee!
Background:
The last salutation (55th) was associated with the twenty second canto of Srimadh
RaamayaNam, where the reference was to the building of the Sethu and traveling
across it by Raama and his retinue to arrive in LankA.
Swami Desikan jumped now over twenty second Cantos and focused on an incident
described by Sage Valmiki in the 45th canto of his epic work. The battle at the four
gates of the city of LankA had begun. Night set in. Monkeys had a disadvantage in
fighting the ogres at night since the ogres doubled their strength at night. Raama came
to their rescue and used six flaming arrows to kill six of the chieftains of the army of
RAvaNA: Yajnasathru, MahaaparsvA, Mahodhara, the gigantic VajradamshtrA, and the
two spies, Suka and SaaraNA. Their death is described by Valmiki as that of the moths
coming in contact with a flame (PrathangA: iva Paavakam). Raama’s golden-feathered
arrows raining on all sides of the battle field made the autumnal night look as though it
was illumined with resplendent fire flies (Bhabhuva rajanee chitrA gadhyOtairiva
saaradhee).
Elsewhere in the battle field, the mighty Angadha, the son of Vaali wounded Indrajith,
the powerful warrior and the son of RAvaNA. The valor of Indrajith was legendary. He
had defeated Indra in a previous battle and derived his name from that exploit. Now,
AngadhA overpowered the powerful Indrajith. Raama, LakshmaNa, VibhishaNA and
SugreevA applauded the bravery and heroism of young AngadhA.
The humiliated and enraged Indrajith used his magical powers and became invisible.
He used a boon conferred by Brahma and hit Raama and LakshmaNa with powerful

arrows, whose shafts consisted of formidably poisonous snakes (naagAsthram). The
scion of Raghu could not locate the cowardly Indrajith, who was fighting in an
unethical and treacherous manner defying the accepted practices of face to face
combat. Protected by his supernatural powers Indrajith remained invisible, while
showering NagAsthrams on the princes of AyodhyA. Raama and LakshmaNA were
bound tightly by the darts in the form of venemous snakes through an act of conjury by
Indrajith. Raama and LakshmaNA were immobilized by the network of poisonous
snakes biting into them. Indrajith continued to torment the heroic bothers, even when
they were unable to fight him. With all of their limbs pierced by the son of RAvaNA
practicing witchcraft, the two princes of AyodhyA swooned. Indrajith concluded that
the brothers were dead and returned to his father's side in a triumphant mood.
RAvaNA congratulated his valiant son and then commanded his servants to transport
Sita in the Pushpaka Vimanam and to show her the sad and helpless plight of her
husband and her brother-in-law. Sita burst into a wail on seeing Her husband lying
helpless tied by the net of hissing serpents. Trijata, one of the prison guards of Sita
consoled her and assured her that no evil would befall the scions of Raghu and took
Sita back to AshokA grove.
Raama regained consciousness and wailed over the lot of LakshmaNA. Hearing
Raama's wail, the monkeys got despondent. Raama thanked SugrIva for his display of
extraordinary friendship and support and all around there was a thick curtain of
melancholy. The father-in-law of SugreevA, SuseshaNaa, suggested that HanumAn
should rush over to the milky Ocean and bring back the medicinal herbs of
SanjivakaraNi (Life restorer) and Visalyaa (healer of wounds inflicted by the
NagAsthram invoked by Indrajith). As these discussions were taking place, something
totally unexpected happened.
There arose a mighty wind and the sky was filled with lightning. Waters of the ocean
rose whipped up by the furious winds. The son of VinathA, GarudA became visible in
the sky flying at a terrifying speed. The serpents covering the bodies of the brothers ran
for their life at the sight of their feared enemy. GarudA descended and lifted the
brothers and then wiped their faces with his hand. The touch of GarudA cicatrized the
wounds on the limbs of the brothers inflicted by Indrajith and their skins turned bright
and smooth. The strength, majesty, splendour, perspicacity and the intelligence of the
brothers redoubled as a result of the touch of GarudA, the embodiment of Vedas.
GarudA joyfully embraced both the brothers. Raama asked the life-saver GarudA as to
who he was and what he can do for his extraordinary service. GarudA replied: “aham
sakhA tE kaakuthstha priya: prANO bahiscchara {I am GarudA, your dear friend (nay)
your (very) breath moving outside, arrived here for your help}. Hearing that you have
been fettered by the snakes, I rushed at once to your side out of my affection and
78

friendship for you. I shall now depart. You should not be curious about our friendship
any more. At the conclusion of your battle with RAvaNA and your victory over him, you
will come to recognize the mystery behind our friendship. You will destroy all the
demons of LankA including the evil RAvaNA and rejoin with Sita.”
After the above response to the queries of Raama, GarudA walked clockwise around
Raama to show his respect, embraced Raama, spread his golden wings and soared into
the sky with the speed of the winds of deluge. The simian army was thrilled to see
Raama and LakshmaNA restored to their original selves and raised a tumultuous noise
in happiness.
GarudA BhagavAn is the Lord of Pakshiraja Manthram, which was recited by Swami
Desikan on OushadhAdhri at Thiruvahindrapuram. GarudA was pleased and appeared
before Swami and initiated him into Sri Hayagreeva Manthram and Lord Hayagreeva
sat on the tip of Swami's tongue and rest of what happened led to us being blessed with
the Sri Sookthis of Sri Nigamaantha MahA Desikan. Thus, Swami Desikan was
indebted to GarudA Bhagavaan immensely. His tribute to Garudha BhagavAn took the
form of GarudA PanchAsath and GarudA daNdakam.He describes the embrace of
GarudA on the battle field in LankA in the 48th slokam of GarudA PanchAsath. He
calls that kaimkaryam as “Labdha SevA visesha:” (one who obtained that bhagyam of
distinguished service to Raama). Swami goes on to describe that GarudA was fortunate
to receive the embrace of the shoulders of Raama, which were renowned for their
fragrance arising from the association with the flowers decorating the ears of SitA dEvi
(VaidEhi karNapoora surabhiNA ya:samAsleshi DhOshNA Sa GarudA:)

Hail to Thee, O RaghuveerA with the right mixture of anger and valor, who with

majesty had the power to split into two the broad, door-like chests of the multitudes of
ogres that closed their eyes out of a sense of shame over the thought of fighting the
“lowly” monkeys for the first time in their careers as warriors! Hail to Thee!
Background:
After Raama was released from Naaga Paasam; a mighty war broke out between the
jubilant monkey chieftains and the army of ogres defending the capitol city of
RAvaNA. The ferocious ogres used to mighty battles had never experienced anything
like battling the forest dwelling monkeys. The ogres had to take their engagement with
the monkeys very seriously. The ogres were uncomfortable over their unfamiliar role of
fighting the monkeys, which fought with uprooted trees and splinters of mountains.
The ogres were ashamed about their inadequacies to fight in this new type of war with
the strange enemies. The ogres closed their eyes as if in contempt. Raama was angry at
their unsoldierly conduct. Raama got furious over the insult of the ogres and his
strength increased. The ogres turned to him for fight. The mighty Raama used his
powerful arrows to break open the door-like, broad chests of the ogres and dispatched
them to the world of Yama devan.

Meaning:
Hail to Thee, O Raghuveera, who through your compassionate act of letting RAvaNA
leaves the battle field and rest overnight to restore his strength, when the agitated
RAvaNA could not match your prowess in the battle field! The ferocious sounding
80

arrows leaving your bow did their powerful work and split into pieces the crowns of the
ten-headed RAvaNA and made him fear for his life. Seeing his weak state, you as a
noble warrior did not want to take advantage of him, when he was weak and unable to
defend himself. You permitted him to retire from the battle field and then return the
next day after a well-needed rest in his palace.
Background:
RAvaNA sent his commander-in-chief, PrahasthA to the battle field as the simian army
led by NilA destroyed many divisions of his army. Prahastha caused a lot of damage to
the army of monkeys, who fought only with uprooted trees and pieces of rocks. In a
fierce battle, NilA threw a big rock over the head of Prahastha and shattered his head
and killed him. RAvaNA was disconsolate over the death of his commander-in-chief
and decided to take control of the battle in his own hands. He appeared on the battle
field and immediately began to make short work of the monkey chieftains. He
stupefied Sugreeva with a swift arrow. He struck Hanuman in the chest and sent him
reeling. Then he began to torment NilA, who had earlier killed PrahasthA, his
commander-in-chief. With great agility, NilA evaded RAvaNA and perched himself on
the banner of the chariot of RAvaNA. The angry RAvaNA dispatched an arrow
empowered by Agni at NilA, the son of Agni. NilA's life was spared by his father, but
he was knocked unconscious.
“HanumAn with Raama-lakshmana on his shoulders”
81

The triumphant RAvaNA gloated with pride now dashed towards LakshmaNA and
sent a flurry of arrows at him. LakshmaNA sent his own arrows flying at the speed of
lightning and tore the arrows of RAvaNA in flight. LakshmaNA cut the bow of
RAvaNA in to three pieces with his arrows and bathed RAvaNA in a shower of sharp
arrows. The enraged RAvaNA struck LakshmaNA with a javelin given to him by
Brahma and grievously hurt LakshmaNA with it and knocked him off his feet. The tenheaded king of Ogres came down from his chariot and tried to lift and carry away
LakshmaNA as a trophy. The great RAvaNA, who had once lifted Kailaasa Mountain,
could not however succeed in lifting LakshmaNA. Meanwhile, Hanuman had
recovered from his earlier battle with RAvaNA and rushed to the side of the fallen
LakshmaNa. He gave a mighty blow to RAvaNA and sent him reeling. Hanuman used
that moment to lift and carry off the unconscious LakshmaNA to the side of the
worried Raama. Hanuman had no problem lifting LakshmaNA, while RAvaNA could
not succeed in his efforts.
HanumAn now appealed to Raama and requested Raama to subdue the king of ogres
and to fight him, while being mounted on his shoulders. RAvaNA was standing in his
chariot and Raama confronted him from his perch on the shoulders of Hanumaan. In a
fierce battle, Raama tore up into pieces RAvaNA's chariot with its wheels, horses,
standard, canopy, the charioteer and the weapons stored on the sides of that mighty
chariot. Next, Raama hit RAvaNA in the chest with a fiery arrow and RAvaNA reeled
and began to swoon. With another crescent-shaped arrow shining like fire, Raama tore
the diadem of the king of ogres. Now, RAvaNA looked like a poisonous snake divested
of its poison. Raama sized the situation quickly and recognized that RAvaNA was in no
shape to continue the fight and could easily be killed then and there. Out of his sense
of fairness and compassion, Raama praised RAvaNA for the earlier display of his great
skills in the battle field and told him that he (Raama) will not elect to kill him then,
when he (RAvaNA) was in no shape to continue the fight. Raama’s words were:

LakshamNA. I recognize that you are battle-fatigued. Hence, I would not kill you now
and dispatch you to the world of Yama. You are not in any shape to stand up and
continue your fight with me. Hence; I give you permission to leave the battle field.
Reenter LankA, rest a while and return with a new chariot and weapons. Then, you can
witness my strength.
Consoled by the words of the compassionate Raama, the mighty RAvaNA shorn of his
vanity, pride and joy hastily left the battle field in disgrace and returned to his palace.
After RAvaNA left, Raama and the recovered LakshmaNA toured the battle field and
removed the arrows from the limbs of the brave monkey chieftains, who had been
wounded in their battle with RAvaNA before Raama came to their rescue. The
oudhAryam and the heroism of Raama is celebrated in this famous, fifty ninth canto of
Yuddha Khaandham by sage Vaalmiki.

KUMBHAKARNA KULA GIRI VIDHALANA DHAMBHOLI BHOOTHA  
NISSANKA: KANKAPATHRA ! JAYA! JAYA!
Meaning:
Oh Raghuveera with the arrow of unquestioned power to break apart the family
mountain of RAvaNA known as KumbhakarNA! Hail to The! Hail to Thee!
Background:
After his humiliating encounter with Raama in the battle field, RAvaNA retired to his
palace. He thinks of his slumbering brother KumbhakarNa as the one, who can destroy
Raama and his retinue. With great effort, RAvaNA succeeds in waking his brother from
his deep sleep and sends him to battle. The nine cantos of Yuddha Khaandham of
Srimadh RaamAyanam (60 to 68) cover the incidents related to KumbhakarNA and his
loss of life at the hands of Raama. Swami Desikan's fifty ninth salutation of Raghuveera
Gadhyam covers the heroic deeds of Raama in dispatching KumbhakarNA to his
permanent rest. Swami Desikan states that the unmatched power of Raama's arrows
broke into two the mighty and proud chest of KumbhakarNa and finally severed his
royal head. The salutation here is to the heroism of Raama and the unassailable power
of his arrows. They tore open the chest of the ogre like the Vajra weapon of Indra broke
the mountains into two. Swami states that there was no doubt whatsoever on the
capabilities of Raama's arrows.
KumbhakarNA was the younger brother of RAvaNA. Due to Brahma's curse, he slept
for six months at a stretch and was awake only for a day. Then he went right back to
sleep for another six months. He was asleep till the time of RAvaNA's battle with
83

Raama. The humiliated and brooding RAvaNA thought over all the curses of the gods
and celestials that he had offended earlier such as Brahma, Vedavathi, Nandkeswara,
Rambha and PunjikasthalA. Brahma's boon to RAvaNA gave him immunity from
death from every class of beings except by “a human being”. Nandikeswara’s curse
made sure that RAvaNA's kingdom will be destroyed by the monkeys. The curses of
Rambha, Vedavathi, Parvathi and PunjikasthalA made RAvaNA vulnerable to death
from his offensive behavior to women. Reflecting over all of these incidents from his
past, RAvaNA came to the conclusion that his mighty younger brother would be the
right agent to engage the army of monkeys and Raama in battle and save him.
RAvaNA woke up his slumbering brother with great effort and warned KumbhakarNa
about the danger posed by Raama and urged him to destroy the princes of AyodhyA
along with the simian army. The just and brave KumbhakarNA criticized RAvaNA for
his past misdeeds as a ruler and gives a piece of his mind:
“Speedily enough has the fruit of your sinful deed (the abduction of Sita) has come
upon you, even as the damnation would visit a person of sinful deeds. Initially, of
course, was this course of action (returning Sita and asking for Raama's apology) not
weighed by you; Nor was the consequence taken into account in the sheer pride of your
prowess.” RAvaNA did not like the beratings of his brother and yet needed his help.
He said: “A kinsman is he, who is able to render help to those, who have deviated from
the right course.” Recognizing the agitated state of his elder brother, KumbhakarNA
calms him down and agrees to engage Raama and his retinue in battle. He entered the
battle field and terrorized the army of monkeys and its chieftains. Hanuman, AngadA,
NilA fought valiantly with KumbhakarNA and could not stop him. LakshmaNA took
on the ogre, who praised the valor of the younger brother of Raama and yet bypassed
him seeking his battle with Raama. The intrepid Raama rushed towards
KumbhakarNA with a quiver full of powerful arrows and listened to latter braggadocio.
Raama's arrow severed the mace-wielding arm of the boasting ogre. Now
KumbhakarNa lifted a Palmyra tree with his other hand and rushed towards Raama.
Raama cut that arm too with a missile presided over by Indra. With two more crescent
shaped arrows, Raama severed the legs of the rushing KumbhakarNA. With yet another
arrow shining with its effulgence in all directions, Raama severed the head of
kumbhakarNA. Thus the mighty KumbhakarNA was reduced to a headless, limbless
mass by Raama’s unquestionable arrows.
Saint Thyagaraja in his Saveri Krithi “Raama BhANa thrANa sowrya mEmani
telupathurA O manasA” pays his tribute to the power of the arrows of Raama. He says:
“O my mind! How can I describe the saving valor of Raama's arrow, the arrow that
killed the army of RAvaNA, who desired Sita Devi; when LakshmaNA lay senseless on
the battle field and RAvaNA rejoiced and Indrajith exhorted and his hosts rose up to
84

attack at that opportune moment, Raama aimed that arrow with the thundering noise
of the bowstring, and saw his brother LakshmNA getting up woth his senses restored.”
The Saint salutes the thundering noise (dankAra Dwani) of Raama’s Kodhandam this
way: “KodhandapujyAghoshamu lasanulu jesi”.
Swami Desiakn's next salutation (#### 60) focuses on the episode of
Indrajith and his fateful encounter with LakshmaNA witnessed by the proud elder,
Raama.

RAKSHASA DWANDHWA YUDDHA ! JAYA! JAYA!  
Meaning:
O Raghuveera! Hail to Thee, who used the GaandarvAsthram on the troops of
RAvaNA's choice fighting unit known as moola Bhalam and caused them as a result to
be deluded to fight with each other instead of fighting with the members of your
army.Your brother LakshmaNA was the witness to that scene of utter confusion in the
ranks of RAvaNA's soldiers after he himself had dispatched Indrajith in a fierce battle.
Earlier Indrajith's efforts to acquire invincible powers through the performance of
necromancy was interrupted by the huge army of monkeys which noisily invaded the
site of that abhichAra homam and interrupted the completion of that homam. The
angry Indrajith stopped the homam halfway through and came to fight your brother
and lost his life in that battle. Hail to thee! O Lord, who dispatched the
GandharvAsthram!
Background:
After the defeat of RAvaNA in the battle field and the death of KumbhakarNA at the
hands of Raama and loss of many generals of the army of his father, Indrajith returned
once again to the scene of combat and aimed the powerful BrahmAsthram at Raama,
LakshmaNA and the simian army. That missile rendered the princes of AyodhyA and
the monkey army of Sugreeva totally unconscious. Raama and LakshmaNA decided to
honor the power of the missile presided over by Brahma and stayed motionless and
helpless. Sugrreva and a host of other high-ranking generals of his army were also
knocked out.
VibhishaNa and Hanumaan were the ones, who were not affected. They found the old
bear JAmbhavAn lying semiconscious on the battle ground. JaambhavAn advised the
approaching VibhishaNA that Hanuman alone can save the day. He suggested that
HanumAn known for his speed in the air should rush to a specific site in HimaalayAs
and fetch the four powerful medicinal herbs to restore Raama, LakshmaNA and all the
monkeys that were rendered unconscious by Indrajith. The bear king described the
four medicines and their power this way:
1. Mruthasanjeevini, which had the power to bring the dead back to life
2. Visalyakarani, which had the power of extracting the weapons and healing the
   wounds caused by those weapons
3. SuvarNakaraNi, which had the power to restore the body to its original complexion
4. SandhAni, which had the power to join back torn limbs and broken bones
   Earlier, Sugreeva’s father-in-law had suggested bringing of these medicinal herbs by
   86

HanumAn. That occasion was when Raama and LakshmaNA were bound by the
Naaga Paasam of Indrajith. GarudA appeared and chased off the snakes and embraced
the brothers back to their original state. HanumAn did not have to go then in search of
these four herbs.
HanumAn set forth on this mission and jumped off from the top of the Trikuta
mountain of Lankha in search of the four divine herbs. As he approached the site of the
herbs, they hid from HanumAn's sight. AnjaneyA got angry at their lack of compassion
to help even Raama, Hanuman tore of the whole mountain housing the herbs and sped
away with frightening speed back to the battle field and put the mountain down in the
midst of the simian ranks. This expedition gave Hanuman the name of Sanjeevi
Raayan.
Raama, LakshmaNA and every one of the members of the simian army recovered from
their state of torpor or state of death after inhaling the wind-blown fragrance of these
herbs. Even monkeys, whose dead bodies were cast into the oceans by the ogres, were
restored back to life. The joyous monkeys ran through the gates of LankA and set fire
to the city. More ogres were killed by the monkeys and Raama. The surprised Indrajith
returned to the battle field and engaged in a formidable fight. He used black magic and
became invisible and began to torment the princes of AyodhyA once again. He then
retreated to the city and returned with an illusory image of Sita and killed her in front of
Hanumaan. Sri Raama fainted on hearing the death of Sita. LakshmaNA and
VibhishaNA consoled Raama. LakshmaNA vowed then to kill Indrajith. VibhishaNA
told Raama that Sita was alive and that his nephew was only creating an illusory act so
that he can return to a secret place (Nikumbhala) to gain more magical powers through
performance of a homam based on necromancy.
VibhishaNA guided the simian army and LakshmaNA to the site of the abhichara
homam. The monkeys fell on the site in huge numbers and disrupted the completion of
that homam. There was a mighty battle between LakshmaNA and Indrajith.
LakshmaNa used a missile presided by IndrA and addressed the following prayer to
IndrAsthrA: “If Sri Raama, son of Dasaratha has set his mind on virtue and is true to
his promise and is unrivalled in prowess, make short work, the, of this son of
RAvaNA.”
Sage Valmiki's slokam housing this prayer of lakshmaNA is as follows:

DHARMATHMA SATYASANDHASCCHA RAMO DASARATHIRYATHA I  
POWRUSHE CHAPRATHIDHWANDHVASTHADHAINAM JAHI RAVANIM II

After this prayer, LakshmaNA released the Missile presided over by IndrA. Flying at
lightning speed, that missile severed the head of Indrajith.
87

Raama was delighted with the news of Indrajith's death at LakshmaNA's hands at
Nikumbhilai. RAvaNA was grief stricken over the loss of his son. He sent his diverse
battalion known as mula Balam to avenge the death of his beloved son. Raama
dispatched the mystic GandharvAsthram resided over by the GandharvAs. That
asthram created the illusion of many Raamas in the middle of the ranks of the Mula
balam. The rank and file of RAvaNA's powerful army mistook each other for Raama
and killed each other. There was utter confusion in the battle field. Two lakhs of ogres
fighting on foot were eliminated by Raama single-handedly through the use of
GandharvAsthram. LakshmaNa was the thrilled witness to the prowess of his brother,
which he ahd invoked in his prayer to the IndrAsthram to decapitate Indrajith. That is
what Swami Desikan refers to in the sixtieth salutation of Raghuveera Gadhyam, when
he addresses Raama as “Maghavajith abhihanana kruth anuja saakshika rakshasa
dwandhva Yuddha.”
Thus ends the ninety third canto of the Yuddha KhAndam of Sage Valmiki’s Srimadh
RaamAyaNam from which Swami Desikan drew his inspiration.

The extraordinary heroism of Raama in dispatching two lakhs of foot soldiers of Mula

other heroic deeds such as the destruction of mighty KumbhakarNa. Overpowered by
these thoughts, Swami Desikan eulogizes Raama as the warrior whose performance in
the battle field can not be matched by anyone.

At the end of the destruction of the Mula Balam, Raama said: “Yethadh asthra balam

Raama was conversing with the assembled SugreevA, VibhishaNa, HanumAn,
JaambhavAn, MaindA and DwividhA, who were standing near him witnessing the
frenzied fight between the foot soldiers of Mula balam. It is here he said: “Such
wonderful power of using divine missiles exists either in me or in Lord Siva
(TryambhakA).”
Raama's power in using the mystic weapons was greater than that of Lord Siva and yet
he compared himself as equal to Lord Siva out of his generous nature to give credit to
others. Further, as a “human being”, he did not want to set an example of just praising
himself as being far superior to a God known for his skills in handling virulent asthrams
such as Paasupatham.

Meaning:
O Raghuveera, whose prowess was certified to be true by your enemy RAvaNA, when
he was led away from the battle field in shame by his charioteer! Hail to Thee!
Background:
RAvaNA lost more generals and mighty warriors following the death of his beloved
son, Indrajith. He came hence to the battle field once again and there was a mighty
battle between Raama and RAvaNA.
Displaying unmatchable martial ardour, Raama sent many weapons to put an end to
the evil ogre. RAvaNA could not cope with the onslaught and became bewildered.
RAvaNA's charioteer sensed the danger to which his master was exposed to. He
quickly turned the royal chariot of his master away from the battle field to a safe
destination. RAvaNA was enraged by the well-meant act of his charioteer and chided
him. RAvaNA acknowledged Raama's undisputed valor to his charioteer, while
berating him for his initative to take him away from the battle field. RAvaNA’s words
captured by Sage Valmiki in the one hundred and fourth canto of Yuddha Khaandham
in this context are:
“While my adversary (Raama),whose prowess is widely known, and who deserved to be
gratified through feats of valor, stood looking on, myself, who was covetous of fighting
was made a coward of by you.”
89

The key words of this verse of Valmiki are: “sathrO: prakhyaata veeryasya ranjaneeyasya
vikRaamai:” RavaNa then ordered his charioteer to take him back to the battle field.

O Raghuveera! You had the path of your chariot made fragrant with the showering
blossoms of the celestial Kalpaka tree! That fragrance of the blossoms joined with the
beauty of the agitated eyes of Indra, which resembled the assembly of red lotuses in a
lotus forest. Indra's eyes were agitated first with fear over the sight of the falling of the
ten heads of RAvaNA as they were being severed by your arrows and their immediate
reappearance as though nothing had happened. You removed the fear of IndrA by
“Madurantakam Sri Raamar on thEr”
90

using BrahmAsthram and cut off the evil RAvaNA's head once and for all. That heroic
act of yours was appreciated by the celestials and they showered Kalpaka flowers on
you, which collected under the path of your chariot and made that path fragrant. Indra,
the king of celestials was joyous over the destruction of RAvaNA and his eyes lit up
with happiness. At that time, his multitude of eyes looked like the assembly of
blossomed red lotuses in a lotus forest. Indra has 1,000 eyes according to the PurANAs.
When all of them lit up, it was like the multitude of simultaneously blossoming lotus
flowers. Swami Desikan salutes here the MahA Veeran, who dispatched RAvaNA to the
abode of death and made the Devas and their king joyous through his victory over the
evil ogre.

AKHILA JAGADHADHIKA BHUJA BALA DASA LAPANA DASAKA LAVANA  
JANITHA KADHANA PARAVASA RAJANICHARA YUVATHI VILAPANA


VACHANA SAMAVISHAYA NIGAMA SIKHARA NIKARA MUKHARA MUKHA  
MUNI VARA PARIPANITHA ! JAYA! JAYA!

In this beautiful passage resonant with sound effects and TaaLam synchronized with
the heaving heart beats of lamenting MandOdhari, the principal queen of RAvaNA,
Swami Desikan's poetic skills reaches once again a high water mark.
In the section “Bhuja Bala, vara Bala, dasa lapana, lapana dasaka, lavana janitha”, the
playful as well as the skillful use of the same words (Bala, Lapana, dasa lapana, lavana
dasaka) to denote a different context-based meanings, is an illustration of the skills of
our immortal poet.
Swami Desikan starts this gadhyam section by describing RAvaNA's mighty shoulders
known for their power to destroy his enemies: “akhila jagadhadhika bhuja bala”.
Swami says that RAvaNA (until he met RaamA in battle) had the bhuja parAkRaamam
that was superior to all the denizens of this earth and heaven. Bhuja balam is related to
his “Vara Balam” referred to in the next section. RAvaNA had earned many boons from
BrahmA and Maheswaran through the performance of severe penances. His bhuja
balam came from this vara Balam.
Swami alludes next to the ten heads of RAvaNA as dasa Lapana and rhymes it with
“lapana dasaka lavana”, which means “as a result of cutting off of the ten heads”. First
we see those diadem decked heads of DasagreevA on his neck and next we see them
91

rolling on the floor of the battle field at the feet of Sri RaamachandrA.
When MandOdhari saw this sad sight, she was overcome by grief and lost herself in an
avalanche of sorrow. She lamented loudly in her inconsolable grief. This state of hers is
described by Swami Desikan as “Dasa lapana lapana dasaka lavana janitha kadhana
paravasa rajanichara yuvathi vilapana vachana”.
The sufferings of MandOdhari arose from the (death) severance of the ten heads of her
husband (Lapana dasaka lavana janitham). She was beyond herself (paravasam) due to
that grief. She was RAvaNA's young wife (Rajanichara Yuvathi). Her words of
Lamentation (Vilapana vachanaas) rang out in the battle field and melted the hearts of
the onlookers. Those words however contained Vedanthic truths and were tributes to
the PARATHVAM of Sri Raama in addition to serving as lamentations over her
widowhood. Swami calls those lamentations mingled with vedanthic wisdom as
“nigama sikhara nikara sama vishayam”. Their sAmyam (equivalence) to the
Vedanthic truths describing the nature of Brahman (Supreme Being) is the purport of
our Acharya's words. Swami Desikan concludes this salutation by stating that the
victorious Raama was eulogised by great sages with stotrAs, which had Vedic
connotations similar to the ones used by the wise and chaste MandOdhari, while she
lamented over her personal misfortune. “Nigama sikhara nikara mukara muka
munivara paripanitha” is Swami's words. “Nigma sikhara Nikara” stands for the
assembly of Vedanthic truths. “Mukara Nikara Muka munivara” reminds us of the
great sage’s eulogizing their Lord Raama with praises steeped in the Vedic tradition.
ParipaNitha stands for the saluting by the Muni gaNaas.
“Mudikondan Sri Raamar”
92

The lamentation of Mandodhari is housed in the 111th canto of of the Yuddha
khAndam of Srimadh RaamAyaNam.

O MahA VeerA who was made happy by the eulogies of IndrA, Agni, YamA, Nirruthi,
VaruNA, Vaayu, KubherA and Siva, who approached you at the end of your successful
battle with RAvaNA! Hail to Thee! Hail to Thee!
Background:
VibhishaNA rushed to the side of Sita Devi at AsOka vanam and brought the tidings of
RAvaNA's destruction at the hands of her consort. VibhishaNA brought SitA Devi to
the side of Raama in the battle field. RaamA harshly asked Sita to prove her innocence
by stepping into fire, since he wanted to counter any doubt on the part of citizens over
her staying in the stranger's (RAvaNA's) house for many months. At that time, Indra,
Agni, Vaayu, YamA, SivA, KubherA and other celestials approached you, eulogized you
and begged you not to abandon the MahA pathivrathai SitA and to accept her without
“Pomona (New York, USA) Sri Raamar”

any doubt. Swami Desikan says here: “O Maha VeerA! You were pleased with the
eulogies and appeals of the celestials”.

plight of other celestials as they attempted to eulogize your kalyANa guNAs. Hail to
Thee! Hail to Thee!

wanted to express his gratitude to You and asked you about what kind of service he
could render. You requested him to bring back to life the monkeys, which lost their life
in the battle. Indra made that wish come true. The dead monkeys rose up and moved
with alacrity like rapidly flowing floods. O Maha VeerA! Is there any limit to your
compassion?

Background:
Your consort was united with you by VibhishaNA, when RAvaNA was killed. You
wanted to demonstrate to the world her purity and asked her to enter the fire before the
assembled gods and monkey chieftains. Agni Bhagavan lifted your Devi in his hands
and united her with you to demonstrate her unimpeachable chastity as a Pathivratha of
the highest order. Both of you, as husband and wife, had agreed on this course of
action to be separated first and then united to fulfill the mission of your incarnation as
the son of DasarathA. It is no surprise that your dharmapathnee went along with your
sankalpam.

Comments:
Raama had won the kingdom of LankA by his valor and therefore could easily have
appointed VibhishaNA as the care-taker of Lankha on behalf of him as the conquering
hero. Being of a generous disposition and being an unfailing keeper of promises made,
Raama would not think of anything else except to crown VibhishaNA as the successor
to RAvaNA to rule LankA. Earlier on the beach at ThirupullANi, Raama asked
LakshmaNA to bathe VibhishaNA in the waters of the ocean to symbolize his future
coronation as the king of LankA. Therefore this satyavrathA (Raama) crowned
VibhishaNA as per his original pledge.

the fears of the Devas by killing RAvaNA. During his wanderings in the forest as the
son of king DasarathA, the sages sought his protection from the marauding rakshasAs.
Raama came to the rescue of the DevAs, VibhishaNA and the sages and demonstrated
his auspicious attributes as the saraNAgatha rakshakan. He performed his duties and
freed them all from their fears. The excellent manner in which Raama completed his
duties is saluted by Swami Desikan as “nishpanna krithya”.

At the end of the coronation of VibhishaNA and completing his duties, Raama wanted
to return to AyodhyA for reunion with the waiting Bharatha and His mothers. He
stepped into Pushpaka VimAnam with his Devi, LakshmaNA, VibhishaNA, SugreevA,
Hanumaan and the vast simian army. That airship accomodated all of them and sped
over the vast ocean with the speed of the lightning. That vast area of the ocean looked
at time like the little space covered by one hoof of a cow because of the speed with
97

which the VimAnam traveled to its destination.

O Lord, who ascended the throne of AyodhyA and celebrated your coronation

enter the fire to immolate himself, had you not returned from your exile to sit on the
throne of the Raghus! Hail to Thee! Hail to Thee!
Comments:
Bharatha returned to NandigRaamam with Raama PaadhukhAs, when he failed to
persuade Raama to abandon his exile and return to Ayodhya to succeed King
Dasaratha as the rightful heir to the throne of Raghus. At that time, BharathA made a
vow that he will immolate himself in fire, if Raama did not return to Ayodhya at the end
of his exile of 14 years in the forest. On the last day of the fourteenth year, he was all set
to enter the fire, when Raama’s messenger (Hanumaan) rushed to his side to tell
Bharatha that his brother was speeding in Pushpaka vimAnam to reunite with him.
Bharatha was thus saved from his vow of self-immolation.
“Thiruvallikkeni Sri Raaman”
99

The brothers were united and the coronation (PattAbhishekam) was celebrated to the
utter delight of Bharatha and others. BharathA's heart overflowed with joy at the sight
of Janaki Raaman on the ancient throne of the Raghus.

Oh the exalted one among the scion of Raghu! Hail to Thee! Hail to Thee!
Comments:
The kings of Raghu Vamsam are famous for protecting those, who sought refuge in
them. There is however no one in your vamsam, who excels you in the matter of
Abhaya PradhAnam and SaraNAgatha Rakshakathvam. In the divine story of yours
told by Sage Vaalmiki, every khAndam of that epic is full with stories of your protection
of SaraNAgathAs. In Bala KhAndham, DevAs sought your refuge at the milky ocean to
protect them from the terrors of RAvaNA. You protected them. In AyodhyA
khaandham, your brother LakshmaNA fell at your feet and performed Prapatthi and
gained the fruits of that Prapatthi by being blessed to join you in Your exile.
In AaraNya KhAndham, the sages of DandakAraNyam sought your protection and
performed SaraNAgathi. You destroyed Kharan, DhushaNan and others and came to
their rescue. You accepted the SaraNAgathi of the aparAdhi, the KaakAsuran and did
not kill him for his unforgivable offense. In KishkindhA KhAndham, you responded the
SaraNAgathi of Sugreeva and saved him from the terrors of his brother Vaali. In
Yuddha KhAndham, You gave Abhaya PradhAnam to VibhishaNA and accepted his
SaraNAgathi. What Vibhishana really wanted was Kaimkaryam to You. He received the
total response to his paripurNa SaraNagathi and even today, he serves you at
Srirangam. Your prakAsam (effulgence) as SaraNYa seelan (Rakshakan) and your
Vaibhavam as the unfailing observer of SaraNya vratham entitle you to the title of
RAGHAVA SIMHAM. Hail to Thee! Hail to Thee!

With this 76th salutation, the Yuddha KhAndham section of Swami Desikan's
Raghuveera Gadhyam comes to an auspicious conclusion.

vamsams that existed before ParasuRaama destroyed twenty one generations of
KshathriyAs. At the beginning of ThrEthA Yugam, ParasuRaama avathAram took
place. ParasuRaama flew into a rage, when king Kaarthaveerya killed his father, Sage
Jamadhagni. He revenged the death of his father by killing twenty one generations of
Kshathriyaas. Before that time of ParasuRaama's revenge, there were many good Raaja
vamsams. Swamy Desikan observes that Lord Raamachandra reestablished royal
lineages, which were hundred fold superior to those that existed before the anger of
ParasuRaama destroyed those good raaja vamsams indiscriminately. Swamy Desikan
pays his tribute to the Soorya Kula tilakam, Sri Raamachandra here: “Poorva kaala

During the long reign of Raama, the child of a Brahmin experienced akAla MaraNam

Raamachandra about his misfortune that should not have happened. The Brahmin
accused the Lord that the lapses in His governance were the cause for his son's
untimely death. Sage Naaradha revealed the reason for this tragedy to Lord
Raamachandra. Oh Lord! You went on the Pushpaka VimAnam and saw from the air
that an unqualified man from a lower caste was doing unauthorized penance and
breaking the established VarNAsRaama dharmams. When you killed that man linked
to the akAla maraNam of the child of the Brahmin, immediately the dead boy woke up
and had a long life. You became the nectar (sanjeevana amrutham) to bring back the
child to life and gladdened the heart of the Father.

like Arjuna, who placed a flower on the head of Lord Siva one evening and next day he
found that same flower at the sacred feet of Lord KrishNa.

SANATHANA DHARMA! JAYA JAYA!

109

Meaning:
Hail To Thee, Oh Lord Raamachandra, who is the embodiment of all the eternal
dharmAs!
Besides facilitating all karmAs and being worshipped by all of them, You exist as the
embodiment of the dharmAs behind those karmAs. The karmAs in the form of action
are liable to disappear in a trice and therefore they can not succeed in granting the
phalans for those performed karmAs. It is You who is pleased by the performance of
those karmAs as One who stays eternal (SanAthanan) and grants the fruits for those
karmAs.

VAIBHAVA! JAYA JAYA!  
Meaning:
Hail to Thee, My Lord, who granted Sathgathy for even the achEtanams (insentient
plants and other objects) for the mere fact that they had the good fortune of being
born in Your kingdom of Kosala!
Lord Raamachandra had completed His avathAra kaaryam and was getting ready to
return to His Supreme abode of Sri Vaikuntam. At that time, the entire assembly of
sentients and insentients were uplifted to Sathgathy. The achEtana vashtus had not
earned any good merits to deserve such a high status. You reasoned that their birth in
the Kingdom that You ruled was sufficent reason toelevate them and asked Brahma to
grant them residence in the upper (higher) worlds. Brahma responded to his Master's
commands and arranged for the insentients of Kosala desam to reside in a special
lOkam named SaanthAnikam.Those who witnessed the SoubhAgyam that came the
way of even the insentients, who were born in Your land and lived in close proximity to
you were astonished and spread the story of Your permanent glory all over the world.

many noble messages of Srimath RaamAyaNam, Swamy Desikan identifies himself as
a Lion among the group of poets and logicians and states that this composition has
many hard and soft padhams mixed together in a majestic manner to house the deep
meanings of the Aadhi Kaavyam of Sage Vaalmiki. He points out that those, who fear
SamsAric disease will consider Sri Raghuveera Gadhyam as the unfailing medicine for
curing that scourge of a disease. They will study Sri Raghuveera Gadhyam, develop
bhakthi for Lord Raamabhadran and perform Prapatthi at His sacred feet of this Sarva
Loka SaraNyan and Jagath Rakshakan. They will gain Moksha Sukham. Swamy
Desikan appeals to those with discriminating intellect to enjoy the Sri Sookthi of Sri
MahA Veera Vaibhavam to gain Sathgathi.
