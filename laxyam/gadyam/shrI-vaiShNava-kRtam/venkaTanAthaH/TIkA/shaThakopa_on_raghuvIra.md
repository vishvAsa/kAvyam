### Introduction
RaghuVeera Gadyam is one of the many brilliant and moving stotrams composed by Sri Vedantha Desikan, while he was residing in Thiruvahindrapuram. At this divya desam, there are the most beautiful Archa murthys of Sri Raamachandra, Sita Devi, and LakshmaNA. Swami Desikan was thrilled one day by the incomparable beauty of Sri Raamachandra giving darsanam as Kodhanda Raama at this kshetram and recollections about the extraordinary valor of our Lord and his deeds on the battlefield as the MahaVeera at Lanka. Inspired by those thoughts, he summarized in his splendid Gadyam (work in prose style) the Vaibhavam of this Maha Veera and named it appropriately Maha Veera Vaibhavam. Later this work came to be known by its popular name of Raghu Veera Gadyam.

Swami Desikan as a Sarva Tantra Svatantra might also have followed the foot steps of his PaRaamacharya, Sri Raamanuja, who composed his three master pieces in the Gadyam form (Sri Vaikunta Gadyam, Saranagathi Gadyam and Sriranga Gadyam).

Swami Desikan was so fascinated by the Gadya Trayams of Sri Raamanuja that he created a commentary on them known as Gadya Traya Bhashya. This work fits inside another work of Swami Desikan known as Rahasya Raksha with four chapters.

The first chapter of Rahasya Raksha is the commentary on Saranagathi Gadyam also known as Prthugadhyam. The second chapter is known as Mitagadhya Bhashyam consisting of commentaries on both Sriranga and Vaikunta Gadhyams. The subject matter of Sri Raamanuja's Gadhyams were the important doctrine of Prapatthi and his supreme devotion to the Archa murthy at Srirangam worshipped by Sri Raamachandra himself (Sriranga Gadhyam) and the rapturous description of Sri Vaikuntam (Sri Vaikunta Gadyam), the supreme abode of Sriman Narayana and His consort, the object 2

of our Prapatthi.

It is not an exaggeration to state that Swami Desikan's Raghu Veera Gadyam is his OWN Prapatthi to the Lord, who declared at Sethu: “It is my solemn covenant that I stand by anyone who surrenders his all to my keeping. According to this, Vibhishana comes under my protecting hand, which even Ravana is free to accept. I now charge Sugreeva to hail Vibhishana and lead him to me”.

“Sri Vibheeshana Sharanaagathi” It is no wonder that the entire Raamayana is revered as Saranagathi Shastra by Sri Vaishnavas. In fact, Sri Raamanuja himself learned the special meanings of Srimad Raamayanam (Saranagathi) from Srisailapurna or Thirumalai Nambi, his uncle, a native of Thiruppathi. Swami Desikan went on to describe the mystery and sacredness of Prapatthi in Sanskrit and Manipravala texts such as Saranagathi Deepikai, Abhayapradanasara, Rahasyatrayasara et al.

We are therefore fully justified in considering the delectable Raghuveera Gadyam of Swami Desikan as the celebration of the Lord’s covenant to Prapannas housed as the central message of the seven cantos of Srimad Raamayanam. Swami Desikan celebrated the veeram or ParakRaamam aspect of Veeraraghavan in this Gadyam. He went on to celebrate in yet another stotram the valor of this RaNa Pungavan presiding 3

as Archa Murthy at Thiruputkuzhi with the divya namam of Vijaya Raghavan.

Thirumangai Azhwar has performed Mangalasaasanam for Veeraraghavan; the Archa Murthy at Thiruvellore Divya Desam. Kulasekhara Azhwar celebrated the valor of the Lord Raamachandra at Tillai Thiruchitrakootam. Saint Thyagaraja saluted his valor at battle by describing Him as “Dhanda Chathuran” in his Kapi-Naarayani song “Sarasa Saama Dhana Dhanda Chathura Saati Davamevareh?”. The bard asked “O Raama! You are adept in statesmanship and in wielding the four expedients, conciliation (sama), winning over with gifts (Dhana), separating the enemies (Bheda) and punishing by war (DHANDA). Who is there equal to you?” The saint invited that Raghuveera affectionately again in his Husseini krithi: “Raghuveera RaNadheera! Raa Raa, Rajakumara!” As a part of the essay on Raghuveera Gadyam, adiyEn will cover the following items:

1. When to read Srimad Raamayanam & Raghuveera Gadyam? 2. Where to read Srimad Raamayanam & Raghuveera Gadyam? 3. What are the procedures to follow before Reading either? 4. What are the fruits/benefits of reading either? 5. How do they compare in size and structure?    Before answering these questions, let us offer our salutations to Lord Raamachandra!


RAAMAYA RAAMABHADRAAYA RAAMACHANDRAAYA VEDHASEH


RAGHUNAATHAAYA NAATHAYA SEETHAAYA: PATAYEH NAMA:

Meaning:

My salutations to Veda Purusha Sri Raama, who is celebrated as Raamachandra, Raamabhadra, Raghunatha and the Lord of Sita Devi.


AAPADHAAM APAHARTHAARAM DHAATHAARAM SARVA SAMPADHAAM


LOKAABHIRAAMAM SRI RAAMAM BHUYOH BHUYOH NAMAAMYAHAM


I salute again and again Sri Raama, the delight of the whole world, the reliever/ banisher of every suffering and the bestower of all riches.

WHEN TO READ SRIMATH RAAMAYANAM & RAGHUVEERA GADHYAM? The Aadhi Kaavyam (epic poem) composed by sage Valmiki (Srimad Raamayanam) consisting of seven books (Khaandas) and 645 Cantos (Sargas) is recommended for reading in a nine day stretch (Navaaham) or in a 27 day stretch. The nine day reading with starts and stops at particular chapters is recommended for the months of Chaitra, Maagha and Kartika during Sukla Paksham (5th day to the thirteenth day). The 27-day reading is to be carried out starting from the day, when the constellation of Punarvasu is in ascendance to the day, when Aardhraa constellation is in ascendance. There are elaborate procedures for reading Srimad Raamayanam (Sankalpam, Acharya Vandanam, Dhyaanam, Nyaasam (Anganyaasam and Karanyaasam) and Viniyogam for each of the Khaandams.

The procedures for reciting Swami Desikan's Raghuveera Gadyam are few and simple.

One can recite it every day. One recites at the beginning and ending of the stotram “NEELA KOMALA RUCHIM RAAMAM BHAJEH SYAAMALAM” (I meditate on Sri Raama of cerulean hue possessing the soft luster of the blue lotus).

Next, one recites Acharya Dhyanam: “When to read Srimath Raamayanam?” 5


SRIMATHE NIGAMAANTHA MAHA DESIKAAYA NAMA: SRIMAAN VENKATANAATHAARYA: KAVITHAARKIKA KESARI

VEDHANTHAACHAARYAVARYOH MEH SANNIDHATTAAM SADHAA HRUDHI This is followed by the recitation of the entire Raghuveera Gadyam.

As the conclusion, one salutes again the composer of this stotram:


KAVITHAARKIKA SIMHAAYA KALYAANA GUNASAALINEH I SRIMATHEH VENKATESAAYA VEDAANTHAGURAVEH NAMA: II

Finally, the Mangala slokam for Sri Raama is recited:


MANGALAM KOWSALENDRAAYA MAHANEEYA GUNAATHMANEH I CHAKRAVARTHI TANUJAAYA SAARVABHOWMAAYA MANGALAM II



### 2. WHERE TO READ?:

One can recite both in front of a SaLagRaama murthy, Tulasi plant and in a temple or at the puja graham of one's own home. If the recitation is done in front of SaLagRaamam, one should bathe the Murtham in milk, dry it and then start the recitation. (Sri M.S. Krishnamachar's monograph released by Visishtaadvaita PrachariNi sabhaa contains enormous details on the types of SaaLagRaamas. Lakshmi Narasimha, Lakshmi Narayana, Seetha Raama and Lakshmi Hayagreeva SaLigRaamams are particularly welcome to be used in the PaarayaNam).


### 3. PURPOSES OF READING:
Those wishing progeny read BalaKhandam; those who seek wealth read Ayodhyaa Khaandam; those wanting to secure a friend or wishing to secure back lost wealth read Kishkindhaa Khaandam; those wishing fulfillment of their desires (Kaamyaarthi) read Sundara Khaandam; Yuddha Khandam is read by those wishing the destruction of their enemies/obstacles; Uttara Khaandam is read by those who wish liberation from the cycles of births and deaths (Moksham). This is for reading of the individual Khaandams of Valmiki Raamayanam. The reading of Raghuveera Gadyam confers all of the above blessings on the reciter. Both Srimad Raamayanam and Sri Raghuveera Gadyam are considered as the unsurpassed form of Gayatri Mantram.

4. A COMPARISON OF SIZES:    Srimad Raamayanam has 7 Khaandams; Sri Raghuveera Gadyam has the summary of 6    Khaandams and does not include Aaranya Khaandam. You might also note that the    6

previous section on “Purpose of Reading” omitted Aaranya Khaandam.

Valmiki Raamayanam (VR) has 645 Cantos (Sargams) housed in its six books (Khaandams); Sri Raghuveera Gadyam has 92 salutations in 6 sections. The Book-byBook comparison is as follows with Raghuveera Gadyam related information in parenthesis:


- Bala Khaandam ---: VR 77 (18)
- Ayodhyaa Khaandam ---: VR 119 (21)
- Aaranya Khaandam ---: VR 75 (0)
- Kishkindaa Khaandam ---: VR 67 (5)
- Sundara Khaandam ---: VR 68 (1)
- Yuddha Khaandam ---: VR 128 (29)
- Uttara Khaandham ---: VR 111 (18)

(While Valmiki Raamayanam has 645 cantos, Raghuveera Gadhyam has 92 salutations with the exception of preliminary salutation and concluding portions of Raghuveera Gadhyam). The Mahavira Vaibhavam or Raghuveera Gadyam summarizes succinctly the Adi Kavyam of Sage Valmiki revered as Srimad Raamayanam. In 94 Gadya (prose) passages, Sri Vedantha Desikan addresses Sri Raamachandra and salutes His Anantha Vaduvur Sri Raamar 7

Kalyana Gunas. If Gopalavimsathi is the home of mellifluous songs in verse form on Lord Krishna, Raguvira Gadyam is the treasure trove of the “songs” on Sri Raama in prose form. We meet passages from Raghuveera Gadyam in the eighth act of Swami Desikan's allegorical play known as Sankalpa Suryodhaya housing the cardinal tenets of Sri Vaishnavism.

The salutations of the Vaibhavam (Glory) of the greatest of the scion of Raghu begin with an evocative verse: 

JAYATHYAASRITHA SANTHRAASA DHWAANTHA VIDHVAMSANODHAYA: PRABHAAVAAN SEETHAYAA DEVYAA PARAMVYOMA BHASKARA:

VISRAAMA SAMAYA VISRANANA VIKHYATHA VIKRAAMA! JAYA! JAYA!

Hail to Thee, O Raghuveera, who through your compassionate act of letting RAvaNA leaves the battle field and rest overnight to restore his strength, when the agitated RAvaNA could not match your prowess in the battle field! The ferocious sounding 80

arrows leaving your bow did their powerful work and split into pieces the crowns of the ten-headed RAvaNA and made him fear for his life. Seeing his weak state, you as a noble warrior did not want to take advantage of him, when he was weak and unable to defend himself. You permitted him to retire from the battle field and then return the next day after a well-needed rest in his palace.

Background: RAvaNA sent his commander-in-chief, PrahasthA to the battle field as the simian army led by NilA destroyed many divisions of his army. Prahastha caused a lot of damage to the army of monkeys, who fought only with uprooted trees and pieces of rocks. In a fierce battle, NilA threw a big rock over the head of Prahastha and shattered his head and killed him. RAvaNA was disconsolate over the death of his commander-in-chief and decided to take control of the battle in his own hands. He appeared on the battle field and immediately began to make short work of the monkey chieftains. He stupefied Sugreeva with a swift arrow. He struck Hanuman in the chest and sent him reeling. Then he began to torment NilA, who had earlier killed PrahasthA, his commander-in-chief. With great agility, NilA evaded RAvaNA and perched himself on the banner of the chariot of RAvaNA. The angry RAvaNA dispatched an arrow empowered by Agni at NilA, the son of Agni. NilA's life was spared by his father, but he was knocked unconscious.

“HanumAn with Raama-lakshmana on his shoulders” 81

The triumphant RAvaNA gloated with pride now dashed towards LakshmaNA and sent a flurry of arrows at him. LakshmaNA sent his own arrows flying at the speed of lightning and tore the arrows of RAvaNA in flight. LakshmaNA cut the bow of RAvaNA in to three pieces with his arrows and bathed RAvaNA in a shower of sharp arrows. The enraged RAvaNA struck LakshmaNA with a javelin given to him by Brahma and grievously hurt LakshmaNA with it and knocked him off his feet. The tenheaded king of Ogres came down from his chariot and tried to lift and carry away LakshmaNA as a trophy. The great RAvaNA, who had once lifted Kailaasa Mountain, could not however succeed in lifting LakshmaNA. Meanwhile, Hanuman had recovered from his earlier battle with RAvaNA and rushed to the side of the fallen LakshmaNa. He gave a mighty blow to RAvaNA and sent him reeling. Hanuman used that moment to lift and carry off the unconscious LakshmaNA to the side of the worried Raama. Hanuman had no problem lifting LakshmaNA, while RAvaNA could not succeed in his efforts.

HanumAn now appealed to Raama and requested Raama to subdue the king of ogres and to fight him, while being mounted on his shoulders. RAvaNA was standing in his chariot and Raama confronted him from his perch on the shoulders of Hanumaan. In a fierce battle, Raama tore up into pieces RAvaNA's chariot with its wheels, horses, standard, canopy, the charioteer and the weapons stored on the sides of that mighty chariot. Next, Raama hit RAvaNA in the chest with a fiery arrow and RAvaNA reeled and began to swoon. With another crescent-shaped arrow shining like fire, Raama tore the diadem of the king of ogres. Now, RAvaNA looked like a poisonous snake divested of its poison. Raama sized the situation quickly and recognized that RAvaNA was in no shape to continue the fight and could easily be killed then and there. Out of his sense of fairness and compassion, Raama praised RAvaNA for the earlier display of his great skills in the battle field and told him that he (Raama) will not elect to kill him then, when he (RAvaNA) was in no shape to continue the fight. Raama’s words were:

KRUTHAM TVAYA KARMA MAHATH SUBHEEMAM HATAPRAVEERASCCHA KRUTHASTVAYAAHAM I

A great and exceedingly difficult task has been accomplished by you in killing many of my heroic simian chieftains and overpowering Sugreeva, Hanumaan, NilA and 82

LakshamNA. I recognize that you are battle-fatigued. Hence, I would not kill you now and dispatch you to the world of Yama. You are not in any shape to stand up and continue your fight with me. Hence; I give you permission to leave the battle field.

Reenter LankA, rest a while and return with a new chariot and weapons. Then, you can witness my strength.

Consoled by the words of the compassionate Raama, the mighty RAvaNA shorn of his vanity, pride and joy hastily left the battle field in disgrace and returned to his palace.

After RAvaNA left, Raama and the recovered LakshmaNA toured the battle field and removed the arrows from the limbs of the brave monkey chieftains, who had been wounded in their battle with RAvaNA before Raama came to their rescue. The oudhAryam and the heroism of Raama is celebrated in this famous, fifty ninth canto of Yuddha Khaandham by sage Vaalmiki.

KUMBHAKARNA KULA GIRI VIDHALANA DHAMBHOLI BHOOTHA NISSANKA: KANKAPATHRA ! JAYA! JAYA!

Oh Raghuveera with the arrow of unquestioned power to break apart the family mountain of RAvaNA known as KumbhakarNA! Hail to The! Hail to Thee! Background: After his humiliating encounter with Raama in the battle field, RAvaNA retired to his palace. He thinks of his slumbering brother KumbhakarNa as the one, who can destroy Raama and his retinue. With great effort, RAvaNA succeeds in waking his brother from his deep sleep and sends him to battle. The nine cantos of Yuddha Khaandham of Srimadh RaamAyanam (60 to 68) cover the incidents related to KumbhakarNA and his loss of life at the hands of Raama. Swami Desikan's fifty ninth salutation of Raghuveera Gadhyam covers the heroic deeds of Raama in dispatching KumbhakarNA to his permanent rest. Swami Desikan states that the unmatched power of Raama's arrows broke into two the mighty and proud chest of KumbhakarNa and finally severed his royal head. The salutation here is to the heroism of Raama and the unassailable power of his arrows. They tore open the chest of the ogre like the Vajra weapon of Indra broke the mountains into two. Swami states that there was no doubt whatsoever on the capabilities of Raama's arrows.

KumbhakarNA was the younger brother of RAvaNA. Due to Brahma's curse, he slept for six months at a stretch and was awake only for a day. Then he went right back to sleep for another six months. He was asleep till the time of RAvaNA's battle with 83

Raama. The humiliated and brooding RAvaNA thought over all the curses of the gods and celestials that he had offended earlier such as Brahma, Vedavathi, Nandkeswara, Rambha and PunjikasthalA. Brahma's boon to RAvaNA gave him immunity from death from every class of beings except by “a human being”. Nandikeswara’s curse made sure that RAvaNA's kingdom will be destroyed by the monkeys. The curses of Rambha, Vedavathi, Parvathi and PunjikasthalA made RAvaNA vulnerable to death from his offensive behavior to women. Reflecting over all of these incidents from his past, RAvaNA came to the conclusion that his mighty younger brother would be the right agent to engage the army of monkeys and Raama in battle and save him.

RAvaNA woke up his slumbering brother with great effort and warned KumbhakarNa about the danger posed by Raama and urged him to destroy the princes of AyodhyA along with the simian army. The just and brave KumbhakarNA criticized RAvaNA for his past misdeeds as a ruler and gives a piece of his mind: “Speedily enough has the fruit of your sinful deed (the abduction of Sita) has come upon you, even as the damnation would visit a person of sinful deeds. Initially, of course, was this course of action (returning Sita and asking for Raama's apology) not weighed by you; Nor was the consequence taken into account in the sheer pride of your prowess.” RAvaNA did not like the beratings of his brother and yet needed his help.

He said: “A kinsman is he, who is able to render help to those, who have deviated from the right course.” Recognizing the agitated state of his elder brother, KumbhakarNA calms him down and agrees to engage Raama and his retinue in battle. He entered the battle field and terrorized the army of monkeys and its chieftains. Hanuman, AngadA, NilA fought valiantly with KumbhakarNA and could not stop him. LakshmaNA took on the ogre, who praised the valor of the younger brother of Raama and yet bypassed him seeking his battle with Raama. The intrepid Raama rushed towards KumbhakarNA with a quiver full of powerful arrows and listened to latter braggadocio.

Raama's arrow severed the mace-wielding arm of the boasting ogre. Now KumbhakarNa lifted a Palmyra tree with his other hand and rushed towards Raama.

Raama cut that arm too with a missile presided over by Indra. With two more crescent shaped arrows, Raama severed the legs of the rushing KumbhakarNA. With yet another arrow shining with its effulgence in all directions, Raama severed the head of kumbhakarNA. Thus the mighty KumbhakarNA was reduced to a headless, limbless mass by Raama’s unquestionable arrows.

Saint Thyagaraja in his Saveri Krithi “Raama BhANa thrANa sowrya mEmani telupathurA O manasA” pays his tribute to the power of the arrows of Raama. He says: “O my mind! How can I describe the saving valor of Raama's arrow, the arrow that killed the army of RAvaNA, who desired Sita Devi; when LakshmaNA lay senseless on the battle field and RAvaNA rejoiced and Indrajith exhorted and his hosts rose up to 84

attack at that opportune moment, Raama aimed that arrow with the thundering noise of the bowstring, and saw his brother LakshmNA getting up woth his senses restored.” The Saint salutes the thundering noise (dankAra Dwani) of Raama’s Kodhandam this way: “KodhandapujyAghoshamu lasanulu jesi”.

Swami Desiakn's next salutation (#### 60) focuses on the episode of Indrajith and his fateful encounter with LakshmaNA witnessed by the proud elder, Raama.

“Sanjeevi Raayan” 85


RAKSHASA DWANDHWA YUDDHA ! JAYA! JAYA!

O Raghuveera! Hail to Thee, who used the GaandarvAsthram on the troops of RAvaNA's choice fighting unit known as moola Bhalam and caused them as a result to be deluded to fight with each other instead of fighting with the members of your army.Your brother LakshmaNA was the witness to that scene of utter confusion in the ranks of RAvaNA's soldiers after he himself had dispatched Indrajith in a fierce battle.

Earlier Indrajith's efforts to acquire invincible powers through the performance of necromancy was interrupted by the huge army of monkeys which noisily invaded the site of that abhichAra homam and interrupted the completion of that homam. The angry Indrajith stopped the homam halfway through and came to fight your brother and lost his life in that battle. Hail to thee! O Lord, who dispatched the GandharvAsthram! Background: After the defeat of RAvaNA in the battle field and the death of KumbhakarNA at the hands of Raama and loss of many generals of the army of his father, Indrajith returned once again to the scene of combat and aimed the powerful BrahmAsthram at Raama, LakshmaNA and the simian army. That missile rendered the princes of AyodhyA and the monkey army of Sugreeva totally unconscious. Raama and LakshmaNA decided to honor the power of the missile presided over by Brahma and stayed motionless and helpless. Sugrreva and a host of other high-ranking generals of his army were also knocked out.

VibhishaNa and Hanumaan were the ones, who were not affected. They found the old bear JAmbhavAn lying semiconscious on the battle ground. JaambhavAn advised the approaching VibhishaNA that Hanuman alone can save the day. He suggested that HanumAn known for his speed in the air should rush to a specific site in HimaalayAs and fetch the four powerful medicinal herbs to restore Raama, LakshmaNA and all the monkeys that were rendered unconscious by Indrajith. The bear king described the four medicines and their power this way: 1. Mruthasanjeevini, which had the power to bring the dead back to life 2. Visalyakarani, which had the power of extracting the weapons and healing the    wounds caused by those weapons 3. SuvarNakaraNi, which had the power to restore the body to its original complexion 4. SandhAni, which had the power to join back torn limbs and broken bones    Earlier, Sugreeva’s father-in-law had suggested bringing of these medicinal herbs by    86

HanumAn. That occasion was when Raama and LakshmaNA were bound by the Naaga Paasam of Indrajith. GarudA appeared and chased off the snakes and embraced the brothers back to their original state. HanumAn did not have to go then in search of these four herbs.

HanumAn set forth on this mission and jumped off from the top of the Trikuta mountain of Lankha in search of the four divine herbs. As he approached the site of the herbs, they hid from HanumAn's sight. AnjaneyA got angry at their lack of compassion to help even Raama, Hanuman tore of the whole mountain housing the herbs and sped away with frightening speed back to the battle field and put the mountain down in the midst of the simian ranks. This expedition gave Hanuman the name of Sanjeevi Raayan.

Raama, LakshmaNA and every one of the members of the simian army recovered from their state of torpor or state of death after inhaling the wind-blown fragrance of these herbs. Even monkeys, whose dead bodies were cast into the oceans by the ogres, were restored back to life. The joyous monkeys ran through the gates of LankA and set fire to the city. More ogres were killed by the monkeys and Raama. The surprised Indrajith returned to the battle field and engaged in a formidable fight. He used black magic and became invisible and began to torment the princes of AyodhyA once again. He then retreated to the city and returned with an illusory image of Sita and killed her in front of Hanumaan. Sri Raama fainted on hearing the death of Sita. LakshmaNA and VibhishaNA consoled Raama. LakshmaNA vowed then to kill Indrajith. VibhishaNA told Raama that Sita was alive and that his nephew was only creating an illusory act so that he can return to a secret place (Nikumbhala) to gain more magical powers through performance of a homam based on necromancy.

VibhishaNA guided the simian army and LakshmaNA to the site of the abhichara homam. The monkeys fell on the site in huge numbers and disrupted the completion of that homam. There was a mighty battle between LakshmaNA and Indrajith.

LakshmaNa used a missile presided by IndrA and addressed the following prayer to IndrAsthrA: “If Sri Raama, son of Dasaratha has set his mind on virtue and is true to his promise and is unrivalled in prowess, make short work, the, of this son of RAvaNA.” Sage Valmiki's slokam housing this prayer of lakshmaNA is as follows:

DHARMATHMA SATYASANDHASCCHA RAMO DASARATHIRYATHA I POWRUSHE CHAPRATHIDHWANDHVASTHADHAINAM JAHI RAVANIM II

After this prayer, LakshmaNA released the Missile presided over by IndrA. Flying at lightning speed, that missile severed the head of Indrajith.

87

Raama was delighted with the news of Indrajith's death at LakshmaNA's hands at Nikumbhilai. RAvaNA was grief stricken over the loss of his son. He sent his diverse battalion known as mula Balam to avenge the death of his beloved son. Raama dispatched the mystic GandharvAsthram resided over by the GandharvAs. That asthram created the illusion of many Raamas in the middle of the ranks of the Mula balam. The rank and file of RAvaNA's powerful army mistook each other for Raama and killed each other. There was utter confusion in the battle field. Two lakhs of ogres fighting on foot were eliminated by Raama single-handedly through the use of GandharvAsthram. LakshmaNa was the thrilled witness to the prowess of his brother, which he ahd invoked in his prayer to the IndrAsthram to decapitate Indrajith. That is what Swami Desikan refers to in the sixtieth salutation of Raghuveera Gadhyam, when he addresses Raama as “Maghavajith abhihanana kruth anuja saakshika rakshasa dwandhva Yuddha.” Thus ends the ninety third canto of the Yuddha KhAndam of Sage Valmiki’s Srimadh RaamAyaNam from which Swami Desikan drew his inspiration.

O Raghuveera of unmatched Valour! Hail to Thee! Hail to Thee! Background: The extraordinary heroism of Raama in dispatching two lakhs of foot soldiers of Mula Balam is still very much on the mind of Swami Desikan. He is also thinking about the other heroic deeds such as the destruction of mighty KumbhakarNa. Overpowered by these thoughts, Swami Desikan eulogizes Raama as the warrior whose performance in the battle field can not be matched by anyone.

At the end of the destruction of the Mula Balam, Raama said: “Yethadh asthra balam divyam mama vA trayambhakasya vA.” -- Yuddha Khaandham 93. 38 Raama was conversing with the assembled SugreevA, VibhishaNa, HanumAn, JaambhavAn, MaindA and DwividhA, who were standing near him witnessing the frenzied fight between the foot soldiers of Mula balam. It is here he said: “Such wonderful power of using divine missiles exists either in me or in Lord Siva (TryambhakA).” Raama's power in using the mystic weapons was greater than that of Lord Siva and yet he compared himself as equal to Lord Siva out of his generous nature to give credit to others. Further, as a “human being”, he did not want to set an example of just praising himself as being far superior to a God known for his skills in handling virulent asthrams such as Paasupatham.

SAARATHI HRUTHA RATHA SATHRAPA SATHRAVA SATYAPITHA PRATHAPA !JAYA! JAYA!

O Raghuveera, whose prowess was certified to be true by your enemy RAvaNA, when he was led away from the battle field in shame by his charioteer! Hail to Thee! Background: RAvaNA lost more generals and mighty warriors following the death of his beloved son, Indrajith. He came hence to the battle field once again and there was a mighty battle between Raama and RAvaNA.

Displaying unmatchable martial ardour, Raama sent many weapons to put an end to the evil ogre. RAvaNA could not cope with the onslaught and became bewildered.

RAvaNA's charioteer sensed the danger to which his master was exposed to. He quickly turned the royal chariot of his master away from the battle field to a safe destination. RAvaNA was enraged by the well-meant act of his charioteer and chided him. RAvaNA acknowledged Raama's undisputed valor to his charioteer, while berating him for his initative to take him away from the battle field. RAvaNA’s words captured by Sage Valmiki in the one hundred and fourth canto of Yuddha Khaandham in this context are: “While my adversary (Raama),whose prowess is widely known, and who deserved to be gratified through feats of valor, stood looking on, myself, who was covetous of fighting was made a coward of by you.” 89

The key words of this verse of Valmiki are: “sathrO: prakhyaata veeryasya ranjaneeyasya vikRaamai:” RavaNa then ordered his charioteer to take him back to the battle field.

Meaning and Comments: O Raghuveera! You had the path of your chariot made fragrant with the showering blossoms of the celestial Kalpaka tree! That fragrance of the blossoms joined with the beauty of the agitated eyes of Indra, which resembled the assembly of red lotuses in a lotus forest. Indra's eyes were agitated first with fear over the sight of the falling of the ten heads of RAvaNA as they were being severed by your arrows and their immediate reappearance as though nothing had happened. You removed the fear of IndrA by “Madurantakam Sri Raamar on thEr” 90

using BrahmAsthram and cut off the evil RAvaNA's head once and for all. That heroic act of yours was appreciated by the celestials and they showered Kalpaka flowers on you, which collected under the path of your chariot and made that path fragrant. Indra, the king of celestials was joyous over the destruction of RAvaNA and his eyes lit up with happiness. At that time, his multitude of eyes looked like the assembly of blossomed red lotuses in a lotus forest. Indra has 1,000 eyes according to the PurANAs.

When all of them lit up, it was like the multitude of simultaneously blossoming lotus flowers. Swami Desikan salutes here the MahA Veeran, who dispatched RAvaNA to the abode of death and made the Devas and their king joyous through his victory over the evil ogre.

AKHILA JAGADHADHIKA BHUJA BALA DASA LAPANA DASAKA LAVANA JANITHA KADHANA PARAVASA RAJANICHARA YUVATHI VILAPANA


VACHANA SAMAVISHAYA NIGAMA SIKHARA NIKARA MUKHARA MUKHA MUNI VARA PARIPANITHA ! JAYA! JAYA!

In this beautiful passage resonant with sound effects and TaaLam synchronized with the heaving heart beats of lamenting MandOdhari, the principal queen of RAvaNA, Swami Desikan's poetic skills reaches once again a high water mark.

In the section “Bhuja Bala, vara Bala, dasa lapana, lapana dasaka, lavana janitha”, the playful as well as the skillful use of the same words (Bala, Lapana, dasa lapana, lavana dasaka) to denote a different context-based meanings, is an illustration of the skills of our immortal poet.

Swami Desikan starts this gadhyam section by describing RAvaNA's mighty shoulders known for their power to destroy his enemies: “akhila jagadhadhika bhuja bala”.

Swami says that RAvaNA (until he met RaamA in battle) had the bhuja parAkRaamam that was superior to all the denizens of this earth and heaven. Bhuja balam is related to his “Vara Balam” referred to in the next section. RAvaNA had earned many boons from BrahmA and Maheswaran through the performance of severe penances. His bhuja balam came from this vara Balam.

Swami alludes next to the ten heads of RAvaNA as dasa Lapana and rhymes it with “lapana dasaka lavana”, which means “as a result of cutting off of the ten heads”. First we see those diadem decked heads of DasagreevA on his neck and next we see them 91

rolling on the floor of the battle field at the feet of Sri RaamachandrA.

When MandOdhari saw this sad sight, she was overcome by grief and lost herself in an avalanche of sorrow. She lamented loudly in her inconsolable grief. This state of hers is described by Swami Desikan as “Dasa lapana lapana dasaka lavana janitha kadhana paravasa rajanichara yuvathi vilapana vachana”.

The sufferings of MandOdhari arose from the (death) severance of the ten heads of her husband (Lapana dasaka lavana janitham). She was beyond herself (paravasam) due to that grief. She was RAvaNA's young wife (Rajanichara Yuvathi). Her words of Lamentation (Vilapana vachanaas) rang out in the battle field and melted the hearts of the onlookers. Those words however contained Vedanthic truths and were tributes to the PARATHVAM of Sri Raama in addition to serving as lamentations over her widowhood. Swami calls those lamentations mingled with vedanthic wisdom as “nigama sikhara nikara sama vishayam”. Their sAmyam (equivalence) to the Vedanthic truths describing the nature of Brahman (Supreme Being) is the purport of our Acharya's words. Swami Desikan concludes this salutation by stating that the victorious Raama was eulogised by great sages with stotrAs, which had Vedic connotations similar to the ones used by the wise and chaste MandOdhari, while she lamented over her personal misfortune. “Nigama sikhara nikara mukara muka munivara paripanitha” is Swami's words. “Nigma sikhara Nikara” stands for the assembly of Vedanthic truths. “Mukara Nikara Muka munivara” reminds us of the great sage’s eulogizing their Lord Raama with praises steeped in the Vedic tradition.

ParipaNitha stands for the saluting by the Muni gaNaas.

“Mudikondan Sri Raamar” 92

The lamentation of Mandodhari is housed in the 111th canto of of the Yuddha khAndam of Srimadh RaamAyaNam.

O MahA VeerA who was made happy by the eulogies of IndrA, Agni, YamA, Nirruthi, VaruNA, Vaayu, KubherA and Siva, who approached you at the end of your successful battle with RAvaNA! Hail to Thee! Hail to Thee! Background: VibhishaNA rushed to the side of Sita Devi at AsOka vanam and brought the tidings of RAvaNA's destruction at the hands of her consort. VibhishaNA brought SitA Devi to the side of Raama in the battle field. RaamA harshly asked Sita to prove her innocence by stepping into fire, since he wanted to counter any doubt on the part of citizens over her staying in the stranger's (RAvaNA's) house for many months. At that time, Indra, Agni, Vaayu, YamA, SivA, KubherA and other celestials approached you, eulogized you and begged you not to abandon the MahA pathivrathai SitA and to accept her without “Pomona (New York, USA) Sri Raamar” 93

any doubt. Swami Desikan says here: “O Maha VeerA! You were pleased with the eulogies and appeals of the celestials”.

Indra made that wish come true. The dead monkeys rose up and moved with alacrity like rapidly flowing floods. O Maha VeerA! Is there any limit to your compassion?

Background: Your consort was united with you by VibhishaNA, when RAvaNA was killed. You wanted to demonstrate to the world her purity and asked her to enter the fire before the assembled gods and monkey chieftains. Agni Bhagavan lifted your Devi in his hands and united her with you to demonstrate her unimpeachable chastity as a Pathivratha of the highest order. Both of you, as husband and wife, had agreed on this course of action to be separated first and then united to fulfill the mission of your incarnation as the son of DasarathA. It is no surprise that your dharmapathnee went along with your sankalpam.

Being of a generous disposition and being an unfailing keeper of promises made, Raama would not think of anything else except to crown VibhishaNA as the successor to RAvaNA to rule LankA. Earlier on the beach at ThirupullANi, Raama asked LakshmaNA to bathe VibhishaNA in the waters of the ocean to symbolize his future coronation as the king of LankA. Therefore this satyavrathA (Raama) crowned VibhishaNA as per his original pledge.

the fears of the Devas by killing RAvaNA. During his wanderings in the forest as the son of king DasarathA, the sages sought his protection from the marauding rakshasAs.

Raama came to the rescue of the DevAs, VibhishaNA and the sages and demonstrated his auspicious attributes as the saraNAgatha rakshakan. He performed his duties and freed them all from their fears. The excellent manner in which Raama completed his duties is saluted by Swami Desikan as “nishpanna krithya”.

He stepped into Pushpaka VimAnam with his Devi, LakshmaNA, VibhishaNA, SugreevA, Hanumaan and the vast simian army. That airship accomodated all of them and sped over the vast ocean with the speed of the lightning.

“Thipputkuzhi Sri Vijayaraghavan” 98

O Lord, who ascended the throne of AyodhyA and celebrated your coronation ceremonies and thus fulfilled the deep wish of Bharatha, who had made a vow earlier to enter the fire to immolate himself, had you not returned from your exile to sit on the throne of the Raghus! Hail to Thee! Hail to Thee! Comments: Bharatha returned to NandigRaamam with Raama PaadhukhAs, when he failed to persuade Raama to abandon his exile and return to Ayodhya to succeed King Dasaratha as the rightful heir to the throne of Raghus. At that time, BharathA made a vow that he will immolate himself in fire, if Raama did not return to Ayodhya at the end of his exile of 14 years in the forest. On the last day of the fourteenth year, he was all set to enter the fire, when Raama’s messenger (Hanumaan) rushed to his side to tell Bharatha that his brother was speeding in Pushpaka vimAnam to reunite with him.

Bharatha was thus saved from his vow of self-immolation.

“Thiruvallikkeni Sri Raaman” 99

The brothers were united and the coronation (PattAbhishekam) was celebrated to the utter delight of Bharatha and others. BharathA's heart overflowed with joy at the sight of Janaki Raaman on the ancient throne of the Raghus.

RAGHAVA SIMHA! JAYA! JAYA!

Oh the exalted one among the scion of Raghu! Hail to Thee! Hail to Thee! Comments: The kings of Raghu Vamsam are famous for protecting those, who sought refuge in them. There is however no one in your vamsam, who excels you in the matter of Abhaya PradhAnam and SaraNAgatha Rakshakathvam. In the divine story of yours told by Sage Vaalmiki, every khAndam of that epic is full with stories of your protection of SaraNAgathAs. In Bala KhAndham, DevAs sought your refuge at the milky ocean to protect them from the terrors of RAvaNA. You protected them. In AyodhyA khaandham, your brother LakshmaNA fell at your feet and performed Prapatthi and gained the fruits of that Prapatthi by being blessed to join you in Your exile.

In AaraNya KhAndham, the sages of DandakAraNyam sought your protection and performed SaraNAgathi. You destroyed Kharan, DhushaNan and others and came to their rescue. You accepted the SaraNAgathi of the aparAdhi, the KaakAsuran and did not kill him for his unforgivable offense. In KishkindhA KhAndham, you responded the SaraNAgathi of Sugreeva and saved him from the terrors of his brother Vaali. In Yuddha KhAndham, You gave Abhaya PradhAnam to VibhishaNA and accepted his SaraNAgathi. What Vibhishana really wanted was Kaimkaryam to You. He received the total response to his paripurNa SaraNagathi and even today, he serves you at Srirangam. Your prakAsam (effulgence) as SaraNYa seelan (Rakshakan) and your Vaibhavam as the unfailing observer of SaraNya vratham entitle you to the title of RAGHAVA SIMHAM. Hail to Thee! Hail to Thee! 101

With this 76th salutation, the Yuddha KhAndham section of Swami Desikan's Raghuveera Gadhyam comes to an auspicious conclusion.

The kings of the world prostrated in front of the foot rest of Your throne with their crowned heads. The lustre from the gems in their crowns fell on Your sacred feet, while they prostrated before You. The assembly of the lustre form the many gems on their crowns looked at that time like a MangaLa Aarathi (neerAjanam) for your lotus feet (KiraNa nikara neerAjitha CharaNa Raajeeva!).

Here Swamy Desikan salutes the superior the establishment of hundreds of Raaja vamsams (royal lineages), which are hundred times superior to those good raaja vamsams that existed before ParasuRaama destroyed twenty one generations of KshathriyAs. At the beginning of ThrEthA Yugam, ParasuRaama avathAram took place. ParasuRaama flew into a rage, when king Kaarthaveerya killed his father, Sage Jamadhagni. He revenged the death of his father by killing twenty one generations of Kshathriyaas. Before that time of ParasuRaama's revenge, there were many good Raaja vamsams. Swamy Desikan observes that Lord Raamachandra reestablished royal lineages, which were hundred fold superior to those that existed before the anger of ParasuRaama destroyed those good raaja vamsams indiscriminately. Swamy Desikan pays his tribute to the Soorya Kula tilakam, Sri Raamachandra here: “Poorva kaala prabhava SathaguNa prathishtApitha dhArmika Raajavamsa”.

The land on both banks of Sindhu river belong to GandharvAs. During the time of reign of Raamachandran, these Gandharvaas gave up their traditional profession of singing and amused themselves by tormenting their citizens. The uncle of Bharathan, YudhAjith requested Lord Raamachandran to control the rampaging GandharvAs and restablish order. Emperor Raama sent His trusted brother Bharathan on the mission to teach a lesson to the GandharvAs and to bring them back to pursuing their skills in the field of music. GandharvAs were delighted to practise their traditional crafts and were grateful to Lord Raamachandran for bringing them away from disaster. They expressed their gratitude through singing songs about the prowess of the Raghuveeran.

nakaram. LavaNan was causing a lot of trouble to the sages in his kingdom. The unhappy dEvAs approached You to help in getting rid of this asuran. Oh RaamachandrA! You dispatched Your brother Sathrugna to kill LavaNan and free the sages from the ills caused by him. SathrugnA destroyed LavaNan in battle and returned to AyOdhyA to prostrate before his brother's sacred feet.

They learnt the Ithihsam from the Sage (author) himself and set the slOkams to music and sang before their father at AyOdhya in the royal assembly to the utter delight of their father.

Sage Vaalmiki went for his bath one day to the riverside. There he witnessed a sad scene, where a cruel hunter had killed a male bird, which was sporting with its wife.

Sage Vaalmiki flew into a rage over the cruelty of the hunter and could not take in the suffering of the widowed bird. The curse that emanated from the lips of Sage Vaalmiki aimed at the hunter transformed itself into a well structured Sanskrit slOkam and through that slOkam, the stage was set for the avathAram of the great IthihAsam of Srimath RaamAyaNam. This magnificent RaamAyaNam set in Deva BhAshai was learnt by Your sons from Sage Vaalmiki and they sang it sweetly in Your AswamEdha Mahaa Mantapam at AyOddhi and made You very happy.

RaavaNan appropriated the aerial vehicle, Pushpaka VimAnam form its rightful owner, KubhEran and kept it for his use in Lankai. When VibhishaNan was coronated, he presented it to you for travel back to AyOdhyA with Your Devi and parivArams. When You returened to AyOdhyA, You sent it to the rightful owner, KubhEran, who was immensely pleased and delighted to experience your display of generosity. KubhEran broadcast your udhAra guNam all over the world. You thus became “VaisravaNa viSrAvitha Yasa: Prapanjan”. VaisravaNan is another name for KubhEran, the god of wealth. “Yasa: Prapanjan” means assembly of Fame.

Hail to Thee, Oh RaghuveerA, who brought back to life the son of a sage in Your kingdom, who had met untimely death! During the long reign of Raama, the child of a Brahmin experienced akAla MaraNam (premature death). The Brahmin was overcome with grief and lamented before Lord Raamachandra about his misfortune that should not have happened. The Brahmin accused the Lord that the lapses in His governance were the cause for his son's untimely death. Sage Naaradha revealed the reason for this tragedy to Lord Raamachandra. Oh Lord! You went on the Pushpaka VimAnam and saw from the air that an unqualified man from a lower caste was doing unauthorized penance and breaking the established VarNAsRaama dharmams. When you killed that man linked to the akAla maraNam of the child of the Brahmin, immediately the dead boy woke up and had a long life. You became the nectar (sanjeevana amrutham) to bring back the child to life and gladdened the heart of the Father.

The Kings have to perform AswamEdha Yaagams. In these Yaagams, huge amounts of dakshiNai have to be presented to the rthviks. Lord Raamachandran performed many AswamEdha Yaagams during His long rule with sraddhA. You are the Lord of Universe and it was not required for You to perform these YaagAs and yet as one born in Kingly varNam (Kshathriya vamsam), You upheld the requirements and set an example to the people of the world and got saluted as “DharmO VigrahavAn”.

The karmAs in the form of action are liable to disappear in a trice and therefore they can not succeed in granting the phalans for those performed karmAs. It is You who is pleased by the performance of those karmAs as One who stays eternal (SanAthanan) and grants the fruits for those karmAs.

Lord Raamachandra had completed His avathAra kaaryam and was getting ready to return to His Supreme abode of Sri Vaikuntam. At that time, the entire assembly of sentients and insentients were uplifted to Sathgathy. The achEtana vashtus had not earned any good merits to deserve such a high status. You reasoned that their birth in the Kingdom that You ruled was sufficent reason toelevate them and asked Brahma to grant them residence in the upper (higher) worlds. Brahma responded to his Master's commands and arranged for the insentients of Kosala desam to reside in a special lOkam named SaanthAnikam.Those who witnessed the SoubhAgyam that came the way of even the insentients, who were born in Your land and lived in close proximity to you were astonished and spread the story of Your permanent glory all over the world.

many noble messages of Srimath RaamAyaNam, Swamy Desikan identifies himself as a Lion among the group of poets and logicians and states that this composition has many hard and soft padhams mixed together in a majestic manner to house the deep meanings of the Aadhi Kaavyam of Sage Vaalmiki. He points out that those, who fear SamsAric disease will consider Sri Raghuveera Gadhyam as the unfailing medicine for curing that scourge of a disease. They will study Sri Raghuveera Gadhyam, develop bhakthi for Lord Raamabhadran and perform Prapatthi at His sacred feet of this Sarva Loka SaraNyan and Jagath Rakshakan. They will gain Moksha Sukham.
