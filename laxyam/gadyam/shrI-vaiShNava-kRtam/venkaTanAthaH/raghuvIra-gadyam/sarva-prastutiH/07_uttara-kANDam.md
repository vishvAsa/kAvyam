Oh RaghuveerA! You were seated on the throne of IshvAku dynasty after Your coronation.At that time the big foot rest of Your throne shone like the foot hills of golden Meru mountain. The kings of the world prostrated in front of the foot rest of Your throne with their crowned heads. The lustre from the gems in their crowns fell on Your sacred feet, while they prostrated before You. The assembly of the lustre form the many gems on their crowns looked at that time like a MangaLa Aarathi (neerAjanam) for your lotus feet (KiraNa nikara neerAjitha CharaNa Raajeeva!).

Here Swamy Desikan salutes the superior the establishment of hundreds of Raaja vamsams (royal lineages), which are hundred times superior to those good raaja vamsams that existed before ParasuRaama destroyed twenty one generations of KshathriyAs. At the beginning of ThrEthA Yugam, ParasuRaama avathAram took place. ParasuRaama flew into a rage, when king Kaarthaveerya killed his father, Sage Jamadhagni. He revenged the death of his father by killing twenty one generations of Kshathriyaas. Before that time of ParasuRaama's revenge, there were many good Raaja vamsams. Swamy Desikan observes that Lord Raamachandra reestablished royal lineages, which were hundred fold superior to those that existed before the anger of ParasuRaama destroyed those good raaja vamsams indiscriminately. Swamy Desikan pays his tribute to the Soorya Kula tilakam, Sri Raamachandra here: “Poorva kaala prabhava SathaguNa prathishtApitha dhArmika Raajavamsa”.

The land on both banks of Sindhu river belong to GandharvAs. During the time of reign of Raamachandran, these Gandharvaas gave up their traditional profession of singing and amused themselves by tormenting their citizens. The uncle of Bharathan, YudhAjith requested Lord Raamachandran to control the rampaging GandharvAs and restablish order. Emperor Raama sent His trusted brother Bharathan on the mission to teach a lesson to the GandharvAs and to bring them back to pursuing their skills in the field of music. GandharvAs were delighted to practise their traditional crafts and were grateful to Lord Raamachandran for bringing them away from disaster. They expressed their gratitude through singing songs about the prowess of the Raghuveeran.

During the Raama Raajyam, there was an asuran by the name of LavaNan, who was the son of the asuran, Madhu. LavaNan was ruling over his kingdom from Mathura 104 nakaram. LavaNan was causing a lot of trouble to the sages in his kingdom. The unhappy dEvAs approached You to help in getting rid of this asuran. Oh RaamachandrA! You dispatched Your brother Sathrugna to kill LavaNan and free the sages from the ills caused by him. SathrugnA destroyed LavaNan in battle and returned to AyOdhyA to prostrate before his brother's sacred feet.

Hail to Thee, Oh Lord, Whose Vaibhavam and that of Your ancestors were learned and sung by Your sons, Lava and Kusa! At Sage Vaalmiki's AasRaamam, Your sons, Kusa “Raamayana Leela” 105

and Lava were born. Sage Vaalmiki was struck by their extraordinary talents and taught them Srimath RaamAyaNam, which contains the description of IshvAku Vamsam.

They learnt the Ithihsam from the Sage (author) himself and set the slOkams to music and sang before their father at AyOdhya in the royal assembly to the utter delight of their father.

Hail to Thee Lord RaamachandrA, who was thrilled to hear Srimath RaamAyaNa grantham describing His divya charithram, which incarnated from the lips of Sage Vaalmiki as immaculate Sanskrit slOkams due to the anugraham of Brahma dEvan! Sage Vaalmiki went for his bath one day to the riverside. There he witnessed a sad scene, where a cruel hunter had killed a male bird, which was sporting with its wife.

Sage Vaalmiki flew into a rage over the cruelty of the hunter and could not take in the suffering of the widowed bird. The curse that emanated from the lips of Sage Vaalmiki aimed at the hunter transformed itself into a well structured Sanskrit slOkam and through that slOkam, the stage was set for the avathAram of the great IthihAsam of Srimath RaamAyaNam. This magnificent RaamAyaNam set in Deva BhAshai was learnt by Your sons from Sage Vaalmiki and they sang it sweetly in Your AswamEdha Mahaa Mantapam at AyOddhi and made You very happy.

Hail to Thee, Oh Lord Raamachandra, whose generosity was praised by the happy KubhEran, the owner of the Pushpaka VimAnam, when it was returned back to him by You! RaavaNan appropriated the aerial vehicle, Pushpaka VimAnam form its rightful owner, KubhEran and kept it for his use in Lankai. When VibhishaNan was coronated, he presented it to you for travel back to AyOdhyA with Your Devi and parivArams. When You returened to AyOdhyA, You sent it to the rightful owner, KubhEran, who was immensely pleased and delighted to experience your display of generosity. KubhEran broadcast your udhAra guNam all over the world. You thus became “VaisravaNa viSrAvitha Yasa: Prapanjan”. VaisravaNan is another name for KubhEran, the god of wealth. “Yasa: Prapanjan” means assembly of Fame.

Hail to Thee, Oh RaghuveerA, who brought back to life the son of a sage in Your kingdom, who had met untimely death! During the long reign of Raama, the child of a Brahmin experienced akAla MaraNam (premature death). The Brahmin was overcome with grief and lamented before Lord Raamachandra about his misfortune that should not have happened. The Brahmin accused the Lord that the lapses in His governance were the cause for his son's untimely death. Sage Naaradha revealed the reason for this tragedy to Lord Raamachandra. Oh Lord! You went on the Pushpaka VimAnam and saw from the air that an unqualified man from a lower caste was doing unauthorized penance and breaking the established VarNAsRaama dharmams. When you killed that man linked to the akAla maraNam of the child of the Brahmin, immediately the dead boy woke up and had a long life. You became the nectar (sanjeevana amrutham) to bring back the child to life and gladdened the heart of the Father.

Hail to Thee, Oh Lord, who maintained the superior dharmam of Krutha Yugam while You had Your Vibhava avathAram in ThrEthA Yugam! In ThrEthA yugam, the dharmams and the anushtAnams based on them would be some what lower in status compared to Krutha Yugam. These dharmams will be at “With Simple Alankaram – Madurantakam” 108

their lowest level in Kali Yugam. Raama incarnated and ruled in ThrEthaa Yugam.

During His reign, Raamachandran established and maintained the superior dharmams of Krutha Yugam by banishing adharmam even if it was Krutha Yugam.

Hail to Thee Oh Lord, who observed meticulously Your VarNAsRaama dharmams and completed many AswamEdha Yaagams marked by the most generous gifts (dakshiNais) to the participants! The Kings have to perform AswamEdha Yaagams. In these Yaagams, huge amounts of dakshiNai have to be presented to the rthviks. Lord Raamachandran performed many AswamEdha Yaagams during His long rule with sraddhA. You are the Lord of Universe and it was not required for You to perform these YaagAs and yet as one born in Kingly varNam (Kshathriya vamsam), You upheld the requirements and set an example to the people of the world and got saluted as “DharmO VigrahavAn”.

Hail to Thee My Lord, who is worshipped by all karmAs performed by the people! In this world, whatever Yaagam or AarAdhanam that on peerforms be it for Sriman NaarAyaNan or other Gods, the results of all of those karmAs reach You alone. “Sarva Deva NamaskAram Raamam Prathigacchathy”. You alone are worshipped by all of these Yaagams and Yaj~nams, since You are the indweller of all these dEvathAs. It is like Arjuna, who placed a flower on the head of Lord Siva one evening and next day he found that same flower at the sacred feet of Lord KrishNa.

Hail To Thee, Oh Lord Raamachandra, who is the embodiment of all the eternal dharmAs! Besides facilitating all karmAs and being worshipped by all of them, You exist as the embodiment of the dharmAs behind those karmAs. The karmAs in the form of action are liable to disappear in a trice and therefore they can not succeed in granting the phalans for those performed karmAs. It is You who is pleased by the performance of those karmAs as One who stays eternal (SanAthanan) and grants the fruits for those karmAs.

Hail to Thee, My Lord, who granted Sathgathy for even the achEtanams (insentient plants and other objects) for the mere fact that they had the good fortune of being born in Your kingdom of Kosala! Lord Raamachandra had completed His avathAra kaaryam and was getting ready to return to His Supreme abode of Sri Vaikuntam. At that time, the entire assembly of sentients and insentients were uplifted to Sathgathy. The achEtana vashtus had not earned any good merits to deserve such a high status. You reasoned that their birth in the Kingdom that You ruled was sufficent reason toelevate them and asked Brahma to grant them residence in the upper (higher) worlds. Brahma responded to his Master's commands and arranged for the insentients of Kosala desam to reside in a special lOkam named SaanthAnikam.Those who witnessed the SoubhAgyam that came the way of even the insentients, who were born in Your land and lived in close proximity to you were astonished and spread the story of Your permanent glory all over the world.
