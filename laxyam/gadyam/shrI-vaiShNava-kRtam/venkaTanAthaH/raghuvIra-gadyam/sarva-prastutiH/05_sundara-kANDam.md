Raama's power to bless one with every kind of Iswaryam including Moksham is covered by Swami Desikan here.

O Lord, who embraced HanumAn with joy over the good tidings of locating Sita's place of incarceration by the evil RAvaNA and for bringing back the KaNaiAzhi as Sita’s token of her love for Raama! Hail to Thee! Hail to Thee! You expressed your special affection to the successful HanumAn, who jumped over the ocean with great velocity. That ocean served as a formidable moat for the kingdom of RAvaNA to prevent anyone from entering the kingdom with ease. You held Hanuman tightly in your arm for returning safely with good news after setting the city of Lankha on fire with audacity and giving RAvaNA a taste of things to come. The fire set by HanumAn spread like wild fire and destroyed a significant section of the capital of RAvaNA. You were so proud of HanumAn for his heroic deeds that you embraced him affectionately and through that embrace conferred on him every type of wealth and blessings (Sarvasva DhAna).
