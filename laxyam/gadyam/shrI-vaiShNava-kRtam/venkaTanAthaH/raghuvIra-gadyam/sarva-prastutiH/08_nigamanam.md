In the concluding section of benedictions for the readers of his magnum opus on the “Thanjavur Style” 

many noble messages of Srimath RaamAyaNam, Swamy Desikan identifies himself as a Lion among the group of poets and logicians and states that this composition has many hard and soft padhams mixed together in a majestic manner to house the deep meanings of the Aadhi Kaavyam of Sage Vaalmiki. He points out that those, who fear SamsAric disease will consider Sri Raghuveera Gadhyam as the unfailing medicine for curing that scourge of a disease. They will study Sri Raghuveera Gadhyam, develop bhakthi for Lord Raamabhadran and perform Prapatthi at His sacred feet of this Sarva Loka SaraNyan and Jagath Rakshakan. They will gain Moksha Sukham. Swamy Desikan appeals to those with discriminating intellect to enjoy the Sri Sookthi of Sri MahA Veera Vaibhavam to gain Sathgathi.
