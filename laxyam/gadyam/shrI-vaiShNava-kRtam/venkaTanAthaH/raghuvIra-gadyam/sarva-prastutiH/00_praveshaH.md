Our Lord, who is the Sun of the PaRaamakasam (Sri Vaikuntam) shines with supreme effulgence. He took the incarnation as the son of the Emperor Dasaratha to destroy the darkness (fear) of those, who sought refuge at His feet. He is inseparable from Sita Devi, just as the disc of Sun is inseparable from its luster. Sri Raamachandra of these attributes towers over every one through his anantha kalyana gunas (limitless auspicious attributes).
