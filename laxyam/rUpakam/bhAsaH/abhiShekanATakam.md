INTRODUCTION

**BHASA: His Date, Life and Works.**

1\. THE BHASA PROBLEM

 **Preliminary:**— Bhasa was known only by reputation through the references[^1] to him by merited writers such as Kalidasa[^2] and Bana,[^3] until 1912 when[^4] the late Pandit Ganapati Sastri of Trivandram published the following thirteen[^5] Sanskrit Plays—

[^1]: "Twentyfive different references to Bhasa and his works are collected together in Appendix C to C. R. Devadhar's edition of the plays entitled 'Bhasa-nataka-chakram'."

[^2]: " ‘प्रथितयशसां भाससौमिल्लकविपुत्रादीनां प्रबन्धान्....' —मालविकाग्निमित्रम्"

[^3]: " सूत्रधार कृतारम्भैनीट कैर्बहुभूमिकैः। सपताकैर्यशो लेमें भासो देवकुलैरिव। -हर्षचरितम्."

[^4]: "The Pandit states in his 'Bhasa's plays A Critical Study', thatmhe came across a palm leaf mánuscript of ten Rupakas in 1909 and that in a subsequent tour he secured Mss. of the other three plays Nos. 4,5 & 8 above. All the plays were first published in the Trivandram Sanskrit Series."

[^5]: " A play called Yajnaphalam dealing with the story of the Baiakanda of the Ramayana was published in 1941 and attributed to Bhasa by its editor Rajavaidya Jivaram Kalidasa Sastri of Gondal. This has been since shown to be a spurious work."

 1. Prajna Yaugandharayana, 2. Svapna-Vasavadatta, and

 3. Avimaraka, (*Brihatkatha plays*)

 4. Pratima, and 5. Abhisheka. (R*amayana plays*)

 6. Madhyama-Vyayoga, 7. Pancharatea, 8. Duta-Vakya,

 9. Duta-Gatotkacha, 10: Karnabhara and 11. Urubhanga.(*Mahabharata plays*).

 12. Balacharita (*Krishna play*).

 13. Charudatta (a fragment)(*Folklore play*).

 None of these plays bore the name of the author. Hence the learned editor, adducing a few arguments, put forth his view that—

 1. All the 13 plays formed the work of one and the same person;

and 2. That writer was the great Bhasa owned by Bana and Kalidasa, as their worthy predecessor.

 ** All the 13 Plays, by a Single Author:**— A close examination of all these plays reveal that there are these common features among them.—

 1. All the plays begin with the stage direction नान्द्यन्ते ततः प्रविशति सूत्रधारःAfter this a benedictory verse is found, with which the Sutradhara. commences the prologue of the play: But the classical plays open with the benedictory verse, after which the Sutradhara is introduced with the direction ततः प्रवाशाति सूत्रधार another strange feature of the opening stage direction in all the Trivandram plays is the repetition of the same idea in अन्तेand ततः

 2. The customary practice of mentioning the names of the author of the play, his patron etc. in the prologue is totally absent in these plays.

 3. The prologues usually called प्रस्तावना are termed स्थापना here⁶.

 4 The Bharatavakya is the same⁷ in most of these plays.

 5. The style and language are strikingly similar.

 6. In many of these plays the device of 'Unintentional Dramatic replies' (पताकास्थान)and the figure of speech मुद्रा[^6] (*Paranomasia)* for the opening verse, are used.

[^6]: " See Panca, Pratijna, Svapna & Pratima."

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

6\. Karnabhara is an exception, where it is called Prasthavana; the Pratijna has a variant Amukham for Sthapana and there is no such expression at all in the case of Balacharitam; See Critical study P, lo; and Paranjpe's note on Sthapana in his edition of Madhyamavyayoga,

7.इमां सागरपर्यन्तां हिमवद्विन्ध्यकुण्डलाम् \। महीमेकातपत्राङ्कां राजसिंहः प्रशास्तु नः ॥ भवन्त्वरजसो गावः परचक्रं प्रशाम्यतु । इमामपि महीं कृत्स्नां राजसिंहः प्रशास्तु नः ॥ is the . in Sv. Bala. and Dv. in Py., Avi, Abhi and in Pancha. 12 It is only the above mentioned seven plays that have 'Rajasimhal prasastu nah'in their Bharatavakya. The Pratima, and the Karna. have merely 'Raja bhumim prashastu naha'. In all these plays, we have the word Bharatavakya before the valedictory verse in the Charu. and Dgh. while in the MV the last verse simply refers to Upendra, and in the Uru there is a split verse at its end.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

 7. The same names of minor characters, the same type of grammatical irregularities, the same ideas, sentences and expressions[^7] repeat themselves in these plays.

[^7]: "See C R Devadhar's Plays ascribed to Bhasa, their Authenticity & Merits', where he has noted several such repetitions"

 8. Bharata's rules of dramaturgy are not observed in these plays, in as much as deaths, duels and battles are shown and water is actually brought on the stage

 9. Stage directions are many a time wanting and to be supplied by the readers¹⁰. The directions given are very brief and indicate rapid action, as for instance in '*Exit & Re-enter*.'

 10. The names of the plays are to be found only at the end (in the colophon)

These striking similarities in the thirteen plays convince any reader of their common authorship¹¹.

** Bhasa: the Author of all these plays**:— A careful study of these plays also reveal that—

 (a) The grammatical and dramaturgical rules of Panini and Bharata are not applicable to these plays, which fact shows that they must have been composed before those rules were framed.

 (b) The frequent use of the expletives, etc. in the slokas, the large number of the Anustubh metre, the simplicity of diction (many a time inadequate to bring out the ideas intended), and the absence of the classical figures of speech take them nearer the epic style of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.

 (c) Many of the ideas contained in these plays are to be

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

10.Cf. for instance in the Pratijna II P, 25, 1, 3, the direction Prani- pathya is necessary at the beginning of the speech of the Kanchukiya as the king says later afgifag etc' In the Panca, P, 9 several persons are introduced to the king. The stage direction relating to their apperance on the stage is not found.

11\. Prof. De appears to doubt even this. See his article 'The Dramas ascribed to Bhasa in 1 HQ XVI1 pp 415 ff. RV Jagirdar maintains a similar view See his' Drama in Sanskrit Literature', pp 74 f

seen in the works of Kalidasa,[^8] Asvaghosha,[^9]Sudraka,[^10]
Visakhadatta[^11]
and many others, who owe their indebtedness to the author of them.

[^8]: " See Ganapati Sastri Op cit, and his intro, to SV, & Pratima."

[^9]: "Pratijna 1 18 has been transformed by Asvaghosa in the follow. ing sloka of his Buddhacharita, XII 60.  काष्टं हि मन्थन् लभते हुताशं, भूमिं खनन् विन्दति चापि तोयम् । निर्बन्धिनः किञ्चन नास्त्यसाध्यं न्यायेन युक्तं च कृतं च सर्वम् ॥"

[^10]: " See Pusalkar op. cit, P, "

[^11]: " Mudrarakshasa is probably the outcome of Visakhadatta's study of Bhasa's Pratijna."

 These and similar facts make the readers believe that the author of these plays must be anterior to Panini, Bharata, Kalidasa, Sudraka and such others. But who could he be ?

 Among these 13 plays, there is one by name Svapnavasavadatta which is ascribed to Bhasa by Rajasekhara in the verse—

भासनाटकचक्रेऽपि च्छेकैः क्षिप्ते परीक्षितुम्।  
स्वप्नवासवदत्तस्य दाहकोऽभून्न पावकः॥

—सूत्त्किमुत्त्कावली।

 This coupling of one of the prays with the name of Bhasa establishes that all the other works too (claiming the same authorship) must be by Bhasa, who alone has to his credit a नाटकचक्र।

 Bana observes in his Harshacharita that "Bhasa gained as much fame, by his plays, begun by the stage-directors, containing many and varying characters, and stirring dramatic episodes, as by (the erection of) temples constructed by architects, with several stories and banners[^12] ", The Trivandram plays have all the above features and hence they must be by Bhasa. This Bhasa must be the same as the one owned by Kalidasa as his predecessor and spoken of as a muni[^13] in his Prithvirajavijaya  सत्काव्यसंहारविधौ खलानां दीप्तानि बहेरपि मानसानि । भासस्य काव्यं खलु विष्णुधर्मान् (?) सोप्याननात्पारतवन्मुमोच ॥")
by Jonaraja.

[^12]: " See note 3"

[^13]: "सोग्निरपिं भासमुनेः काव्यं विष्णुधर्मामुखात् त्यक्तवाम् नादहृदित्यर्थः ' while commenting on the following verse of Jayanka (12th cent A D

 These two views of the Pandit were discussed in learned journals by scholars,[^14] both Indian and foreign. The result was that almost all concurred with the Pandit regarding the common authorship of these plays. As regards the other question there came up three[^15]views, viz.—

[^14]: " For a bibliographical note of publications on Bhasa, see Appendix 1 to A D Pusalkar's Bhasa-A study"

[^15]: "Scholars such as Prof. Keith, Thomas and Paranjape suppo tel the Pandit's view; Prof. Kane, Dr. Barnett, Messrs Rama Pisharodi nd Krishna Pisharodi and such others opposed it some others like Dr Sukhtankar and Prof, Winternitz opined that the evidences adduced by either group were not conclusive"

 1. All the 13 plays are the works of Bhasa.

 2. None of the 13 plays can be ascribed to Bhasa, and

 3. The material available to prove the authorship of the plays are inadequate and hence the evidences adduced so far are not at all conclusive.

 Scholars who opposed the Pandit's view pointed out that—

 (a) The features of Bhasa's plays mentioned in Harsha's verse are found also in most of the South Indian plays, and hence can not be a conclusive proof.

 (b) None of the plays can be Bhasa's; for, the *Svapnavasavadatta* of this group does not contain the following sloka quoted from Bhasa's play of the same name, by Ramachandra in his Natyadarpana.—

‘पादाक्रान्तानि पुष्पाणि सोष्म चेदं शिलातलम्।  

**नूनं काचिदिहासीना मां दृष्ट्वा सहसा गता॥’**

 These diverse views of the two sections of scholars naturally Ted to the third view mentioned above, of a few cautious scholars.

 Thus, to this day, the question of Bhasa's authorship has not been answered conclusively and hence it has remained an unsolved problem.

**2. DATE OF BHASA.**

 Bhasa must be earlier than both Kalidasa and Bana who refer to him by name, as observed in the above, and later than Valmiki upon whose Ramayana he has drawn for the theme of his viii two dramas, viz. Pratima and Abhisheka. But Kalidasa's date is still indefinite. If Dr. Peterson holds that "Kalidasa stands near the beginning of the Christian Era, if indeed, he does not overtop it," Dr. Kern places him in the latter half of the 6th sent. A. D. Bana's date, however, is almost definitely known to be the closing part of the 6th and the beginning of the 7th cent. A. D. So, at any rate, Bhasa's date cannot be later than the 6th cent. A. D. As regards the date of Valmiki too, scholars differ. Prof. Keith[^16] 20 is inclined to think that Valmiki lived earlier than the 4th cent, B.C. and that those who improved on him were during the period 400- 200 B. C., while Prof, Jacobi assigns him to a date earlier than the 5th cent. B. C.

[^16]: " See Keith's History of Sanskrit Literature."

 These two limits of Bhasa's date are almost universally accepted but there has been much diversity in the opinion of scholars regarding the exact date of Bhasa. Some feel that he should be closer to Kalidasa, while others feel that he is closer to Valmiki. The learned editor of Trivandram has pointed out that Bhasa must be definitely before Panini and Bharata, as their rules of grammar and dramaturgy are not at all applicable to his plays. Again Panini's date is not known definitely. Keith places him in the 4th cent. B. C. Accepting this date for Panini, if Bhasa is prior to him, Bhasa will have to be assigned to the 5th cent. [][^17] B. C at the latest

**3. LIFE OF BHASA.**

 Precious little is known about Bhasa's life. All that can be said about him is that he is a vrey ancient writer, even a muni of the class of Vyasa or Valmiki. He has strong predilections for the Vishnuite cult. He loves brahmanical rites and customs and often refers to the prominence of the Brahmins. His regard for the Brahmins and their piety is very great. In the Balacharita Kamsa says calmly— "I take even an untrue word of a Brahmana to be a true one" The home was the place of women, according to Bhasa. In the Pratijna, Mahasena freely consults with bis queen the question of their daughter's marriage, but when he has to interview Bharatarohaka in connection with matters concerning politics, he dismisses her. Thus the queen was not privileged even to acquaint herself with the affairs of the state. In Bhasa's time the purdah system and the Gandharva type of marriage were in vogue among the Kshatriyas. Probably the Buddistic culture was just gaining ground, which Bhasa seems to have detested.

 Bhasa is a vehement advocate of Dharma. He believes in the theory धर्मो रक्षति रक्षितःThat is why he makes Yaugandharayana in the Pratijna exclaim— ‘भूमिर्भर्तारमापन्नंरक्षिता परारश्रति’In the Pancharatram, Duryodhana points out that it is false to say that Heaven can be gained only by the dead and asserts that 'Heaven is not invisible but is here and yields its manifold fruits". He again says that" If truth were to stand even in respect of solicited alms, al men shall stand."

 Bhasa stresses on gifts and sacrifices. In the Pancharatram, Duryodhana is represented as performing a great sacrifice and making profuse gifts, the final gift being that of half his kingdom to his own teacher Drona. Karna observes that the great kings such as Ikshvaku, Saryati, Yayati and Rama, though dead, still live through their sacrifices The sloka—

**शिक्षा क्षयं गच्छति कालपर्ययात् सुबद्धमूला निपतन्ति पादपाः।  
जलं जलस्थानगतं च शुष्यति हुतं च दत्तं च तथैव तिष्ठति॥**(Karna Bhara 22 ).

  of Karna is an ever memorable statement.

Bhasa often feels that Fate sometimes baffles all human efforts. 'जाग्रतोऽपि बलवत्तरः कृतान्तः' चक्रारपङ्किरिव गच्छति भाग्यपत्त्किः' 'कः कं शक्तो रक्षितुं मृत्युकार्ले—(Svapna VI-10) are a few of his statements which can be noted in this connection. All the same he is not a fatalist. He has vehemently expressed his conviction that proper efforts are bound to fructify, in the following statement of Yaugandharayana

काष्टादग्निर्जायते मध्यमानाद्, भूमिस्तोयं खन्यमाना ददाति।  
सोत्साहानां नास्त्यसाध्यं नराणां, मार्गारब्धाः सर्वयत्नाः फलन्ति॥

 Bhasa expresses things directly and in a simple and lucid language. There is something remarkably charming in every statement of is. His humour is subtle and original, in appreciation of which Jayadeva called him the 'gentle smile of the Goddess of Poetry[^18]'.

[^18]: "यस्याश्चोरश्चिकुरनिकरः कपूरो मयूरः भासो हासः क बेकुलगुरुः कालिदासो विलासः । हर्षोदः हृदयवसतिः पञ्चबाणः स बाणः येषां नैषाः कथय कविताकामिनी कौतुकाय ॥ Prasannaraghava"

4\. WORKS OF BHASA.

 Mention has already been made of the thirteen plays ascribed to Bhasa. Another play calledयज्ञफलम् dealing with the story of the Balakanda of the Ramayana has been recently म and attributed to Bhasa. There seems to be, however, a belief that Rhasa wrote as many as twenty three dramas[^19] to Priya- darasika (V, V. Press Srirangam.")among which मुकुटताडितकand उदात्तराघव had a place.

[^19]: ". See R. V, Krishnamachariar's Bhumika (P. xxxiii

 About 13 stray verses[^20] are attributed to Bhasa. Of them five are found in the शाङ्गधरपद्धति, four in the सुभाषितावली, three in the सदुत्त्किकर्णामृत and one in the सूत्त्किमुक्तावली. None of these verses is found in any of the Bhasa plays discovered so far. This cannot be a disproof to Bhasa's authorship of those plays, for, we may yet hope to discover more works of Bhasa, where they may be found.

[^20]: " One of these verses occurs in the Matta-Vilasa and four are attributed to other authors by other anthologists. This proves the notoriously unreliable charcater of the anthological attibuton. See F, W, Thomas J. R. A. S. 1927, P. 883 f."

**1. PLOT**

ACT I

**(वालिवधाङ्कः)**

 After taking a pledge to help each other, Rama and Sugriva, escorted by Lakshmana and Hanuman, move towards Kishkindha to fight with and slay Valin. On arriving at the capital, Sugriva, alone moves forward and roars out a challenge to his brother Valin. Valin hears it and regardless of his wife's adivice, goes out, meets Sugriva in fight and knocks him down. Hanuman reminds Rama of his pledge to his master, where upon without a word of warning he lets fly an arrow which wounds Valin mortally and causes him fall down uncousious. On recovering consciousness, Valin reads Kama's name on the arrow and complains that the act is most unbecoming of a hero. Rama teils him that this is punishment for taking his younger brother's wife. Valin is satisfied. He expires after asking his forgiveness, and entrusting his son Angada to the care of Sugriva. to whom he offers the golden necklace (the family heir-loom). Lakshmana, is asked by Rama to arrange Sugriva's, Consecretion.

ACT II

**(अशोकवनिकाङ्कः)**

 \[Sugriva's captains headed by Angada come to the sea-shore in their search for Sita, wife of Rama, and who has been abducted away by Ravana. Hanuman leaps across the ocean to Lanka.\]. *Interlude*.—

 Hanuman enters Lanka and searches long for Sita. He sights Sita in the Asoka Garden, just as Ravana arrives there. He watches the demop's efforts to win the love of the captive Sita who has nothing but scorn for him. After sometime, when Ravana goes to take his early morning bath, Hanuman introduces himself to Sita who does not believe him at first. After acquainting her with the condition of Rama, he assures her of her early rescue by Rama. He then leaves her to announce his arrival to Ravana by destroying that beautiful garden.

ACT III (विभीषणनिरसनाङ्कः)

News of the destruction of the Asokavana by Hanuman is brought to Ravana. A number of generals, one after another, and even Prince Aksha are ordered to captivate the monkey. All of them are slain by Hanuman. At last price Indrajit manages to bring him bound with snares. Hanuman defies Ravana and delivers the message of Rama. Ravana grows furious at this and orders to put him to death. Vibhishana restrains him from killing an envoy. Ravana then modifies the punishment into one of setting fire to the ape's tail and throwing him out of his capital. Vibhisbana urges Ravana to restore Sita to Rama; but Ravana banishes him for disregarding fraternal love and siding the enemy. Vibhishana is glad and describes to resort to Rama to save the demon race from total destruction.

ACT IV (समुद्रतरणाङ्कः)

 \[The chamberlain of Sugriva informs the general that Hanuman has discovered Sita and asks him to get the monkey army ready to march.\]—*Interlude.*

 Rama and his host arrive at the sea-shore. Vibhishana, banish- ed by his brother, arrives there and joins Rama. After consulting Vibhishana as to how to cross the ocean, Rama is about to let fly his divine shaft upon the sea, when the god of the ocean (Varuna) appears in person before him and seeks his protection. He also grants Rama and his host a passage by divided waters. Rama, together with his troops, crosses the sea cut in twain as it were, and pitches his camp en the Suvela mountain. Nee!a, a monkey officer, catches two of Ravana's ministers spying under the guise of monkeys. Instead of punishing them Rama orders that they should be shown the entire camp and then set free. He also sends through them this message to Ravana By abducting Sita, you have brought war upon your head. I have come to war with you, but see you not."

ACT V (शोकाङ्कः)

 \[The chamberlain of Ravana is despondent at his master's reluctance to give up Sita even though all the demon heroes inclusive of Kumbhakarna are dead. He asks another demon, Vidyujjihva by name, to bring faked models of the heads of Rama and Lakshmana, as ordered by Rama.\]— *Interlude*.

 Ravana renews his advances to Sita and shows her the faked models which appear to be the severed heads of Rama and Lakshmana and tells her that the two mortals are slain by Indrajit in battle. Sita swoons. After recovering, she asks Ravana to kill her also with the same sword her lord was put to death. Ravana says— Your wretched husband and Lakshmana are slain now; who will set you free?" Jast then a demon rushes in crying out— 'By Rama by Rama and when the demon king asks him what that mortal has done, he informs him that Indrajit is killed by Rama Hearing this Ravana faints and after recovering decides to kill Sita on whose account so many of his brothers, sons and friends died, but is disuaded. Thereupon he goes out in his chariot to fight Rama.

**ACT VI (अभिषेकाङ्कः)**

 Three Vidyadharas describe the battle between the monkeys and demons, and the duel between Rama and Ravana. After a long and terrible fight, Rama kills Ravana with the *Bramhastra*.\] *Prelude*.

 Rama proclaims Vibhishana as lord of Lanka. News of Sita's coming to meet Rama is brought to him, but Rama refuses to see her on the plea that she has been sullied by her stay in Ravana's palace and has become a stain on Ikshvaku's house.' He gives his assent to Sita's desire to burn herself. She lays herself on a burning pyre prepared for her by Lakshmana, but the god of Fire hurts her not and leads her back to her lord. He salutes Rama ag Narayana and hands her over to him, saying— This Sita is sinless pure, unscathed and honoured of all the world. Know that this daughter of Janaka is the blessed Lakshmi, come to you in human form. All are surprised. Rama says— 'I know her purity, but, I desired to convince the (thousand-tongued) world. The celestial bards sing in praise of Rama. Agni crowns him as king in the presence of Dasaratha, (who evidently comes down to that spot). Rama rejoices at the news that his subjects led by Bharata are arriving there to meet him. The congratulations of Indra and the gods are conveyed to Rama, whereupon he thanks them.

**2. SOURCE AND DEVIATIONS THEREFROM**

 In the Abhishekanakata, Bhasa has presented the story of the Kishkindha, Sundara and Yuddha Kandas of the Ramayana, in a quite novel and striking manner. The story has been slightly altered to make the presentation of it effective and impressive. No radical change has been made, nor is anything very new introduced to im- press the drama with the originality of the writer as in the '*Pratima'*or the '*Svapna*'. Yet the play shows original treatment of the already available subject matter. Thus in this play, at the outset, Valin is hit down by Rama in the very first fight of Sugriva with him. Valin is made greater here, by speaking of him as having taken the foremost part in the *Ocean-churning*. He is represented a very fond father, and a kind, generous and forgiving brother, when, before dying, he is made to offer to Sugriva his family heir-loom, the gold necklace and his son Angada, the *Kulapravala*.

 Rama too is here, a nobler person. The often pointed out defect in Rama's conduct viz. the *pracchanna vadha* of Valin is defended here in an original way. Even Valin is satisfied on hearing Rama's justification of his own act on the grounds (1) Valin is a morkey and can be killed by a king, who is allowed to hunt fighting face to face, or through snares and guiles; and (2) Valin, 'a monkey chief endowed with the power of discretion, has taken his younger brother's wife, (an act prohibited by law codes) and hence deserves death punishment. Sugriva's consecration only after Valin's death (and not earlier in the forest alone) is really a noble thing here.

 In the Second Act Hanuman enters with Rama's ring in hand, but we do not see what happens to it. Although this may look a little inconsistent, it must be admitted that there is no need for Hanuman's giving the ring to Sita, or relating to her the secret of her private life known only to Rama, to convince her of his *bona fide*. Sita is more human here. She decides to speak to him, whoever he may be, for he has been speaking highly of her husband. Being very shrewd, she also trusts him, finding him' trust-worthy from his conversation. Neither Rama nor Sita have any reason to distrust the words of Hanuman. Then, where is any need for Sita to send her Chudamani to Rama? That is why the ring and the Chudamani topics have been wisely dropped by Bhasa.

 The circumstances driving Sita to enter fire are, in this play, different from those in the Epic. They are designed to produce a dramatic suspense and anxiety in the reader's mind and also to show Rama as a king eger alive to public opinion.

 Bhasa'original treatment is best revealed in his description of Rama's crossing the ocean of divided waters and not by means of the famous bridge constructed. Rama's consecration by Agni on the seashore, in the presence of Dasaratha, and Bharatha's going along with his subjects to meet his brother Rama (probably with the intention of assisting him in bis fight with Ravana) and his arrival just at the time of Rama's consecration are clear evidences of the masterly originality of the author.

 All the same, in conclusion, it must be observed that unlike the other plays of Bhasa, his Abhishekanakata exhibits very little of his individuality, in the handling of a popular story.

**3. THE TITLE**

 A remarkable feature of the plays of Bhasa is their significant titles. Every one of their titles indicates either the most striking o feature or the most impressive scene of the particular play. It is only in the case of two of his dramas (the Avimaraka and the Charudatta) that he name them in the most ordinary way, after the heroes thereof. In all the other plays of Bhasa, their very titles rouse our curiosity to know the subject matter, which although a popular and common place one, is invariably presented in a novel and original fashion. Thus if the *Pratijna* is after the peculiar vows taken more than once by the hero Yaugandharayana, the *Pratima* after the Statue House' scene, and the Pancharatra after the 'Five Days' condition of Duryodhana, the *Abhishekanataka*is after the three Abhishekas of Sugriva, Vibhishana and Rama, which occur prominently at the beginning, middle and end of the play. Of these *Abhishekas*, Rama's is most striking and impressive, in as much as it comes up even on the seashore, Agni taking the leading part and Dasaratha witnessing. The rejoicing on the occasion is complete leaving no want or shortcoming, as Bharatha and even the subjects of Ayodhya arrive there just in time. This scene, therefore, naturally leaves a permanent impression on the reader's mind, and the title of the play after such a scene is really a very signifcant one.

4\. STYLE

 Bhasa always employs a simple, elegant and at the same time direct and forceful style in everything that he writes. His verses, as well as his prose, are easy to understand in as much as the words employed are very simple. He is very brief in his expression which is sometimes inadequate to bring out clearly the idea contained therein. He scrupulously avoids the use of long compounds. The speeches of his characters are generally short but pointed and hence very effective. He is very fond of repeating the same expressions, phrases, sentences and even slokas, in the course of almost all his works. He sometimes puns on words. He employs only simple figures of speech. His plays abound in beautiful subhashitas and pitby proverbial statements.

 \[His works contain some grammatical irregularities and departure from dramaturgical rules, which feature only shows that they were written in a period when there were no such hard and fast rules of either grammar or dramaturgy.\]

5\. GENERAL AND TECHNICAL

 The Abhisheka is a *Nataka*. The Hero Rama is a *dhirodatta*, and the rival-hero Ravana is a *dhiroddhata*. The chief *Rasa* is *Vira* and is fed by *Karuna*, *Adbhutaand Bhayanaka* sentiments. The play fairly answers all the technical requirements of a *Nataka*.

 The Abhisheka was first discovered along with the Pratima and Ascharya Chudamani, in a single volume of a palm leaf manuscript. A thorough examination of the three works reveals that the Abhisheka bears closer resemblance to the Ascharyachudamani than to the Pratima. This has led some to think that the Abhisheka is not by 'Bhasa, the author of the Pratima, but is of Shaktibhadra, the author of the A. Chudamani (*See* P. 8 Intro to Abhisheka by V. Venkatarama Sastri; also Kuppuswami Sastri's Intros. to Ascharyachudamani pp. 18-26) When compared with the other plays of Bhasa, the Abhisheka comes last in every respect, in art, in construction, in quality and even in presentation. It contains a very large number of verses unlike the other Bhasa plays. If the play is by Bhasa, it is but a poor, specimen of his high talents.

6\. THE CHARACTERS.

 **Rama—**Rama, the hero of this play, is more a ruthless warrior king than a man with tender feelings. He has a very keen sense of duty and as such, he minds his duty first. All other considerations come up only next. Tne moment Hanuman reminds Rama of his promise to Sugriva (when Sugriva is fighting with Valin,) without a word Rama discharges an arrow at Valin and slays him, although Valin has done him no harm. Sugriva is his *Asrita*, and his duty is to protect him at all costs. Even when Vibhishana approaches him seeking his protection, Rama sets aside all considerations and welcomes him, in spite of Sugriva's protests. His anxiety that the great name of his family should be preserved is so great that he refuses to take back Sita who has lived in an enemy's house, until she proves her purity by throwing herself into fire and is brought back by Agni himself. He has a heart which is mysteriously deep and impenetrable by ordinary persons. He reveals to Agni that he knew Sita's purity quite well and *allowed* her to fall into fire only to convince the wide world of her purity. His very high sense of duty as a king towards his subjects is seen in his not sending word to Bharata for assistance in rescuing Sita, which is his personal business.

 A single arrow of Rama goes through the seven Sala trees and another is enough to slay Valin. The mere threat of an arrow makes Varuna give a passage for him and his hosts across the ocean. Even the mighty Ravana is killed with a single *Brahmastra*. If these show that Rama is a mighty warrior, his treatment to the demon-spies, Suka and Sarana, shows how forgiving he is. His momentous fight with Ravana proves his fearlessness of weapon, demon, or death.

 He is not ambitious. He bates conquest for conquest's sake. He is a *yuddha* vira but is always engaged in a *dharma yuddha* to uphold the cause of dharma. His slaying of Valin is to punish him for the sin of taking his younger brother's wife. When he slays Ravana in battle after a great fight, he does not even for a moment, think of himself becoming lord of Lanka, but straightway crowns Vibhishana, the heir to the throne.

 He is very good to his friends and servants. His treatment of Sugriva, Vibbishana, Hanuman and many others is full of lose, courtesy and understanding. His affection for his brothers and love for his subjects have been proverbial. Reading the feelings of others by looking at their faces is a remarkable talent in Kama.

 In this play Rama is more than once identified with Vishnu-but curiously enough, not once does he himself act or speak as the great god. On the other hand, as an ordinary man, he salutes the gods Varuna and Agni when he sees them. Although Rama is presented, to us in this play only as a heroic warrior ruthlessly minding his duty, every time we see him act or speak, we find a dignified nobility and greatness about him, which raise him to a level far higher than of an ordinary person.

 **Ravana—** Ravana, the rival-hero of the play, is also a brave *yuddhavira*, as evidenced by his fight with Rama which he rages with a terrific fury. No doubt he is a demon with plenty of demonly qualities. His overtures to Sita by entreaty and by threat, his trying to dupe her into believing that Rama and Lakshmana are dead and his inducing her to have a widow-marriage with him and later on, his desire to cut her heart and to pull out ber entrails.as a revenge on her for bringing about the death of his sons and friends show him a demon out and out. All the same, the buman is ever alive in him. As an affectionate father, he dotes on his son Indrajit, and as a fond brother, only exiles Vibhishana for openly siding Rama. He respects every sense of dharma. He is easily averted form slaying a woman and an envoy.

 He is very proud of his heroism and has a conviction that he is capable of defeating anyone, being the conqueror of all the three worlds. But quite contrary to his own expectation he sees his fall, in the death of his sons and in the circumstances most unfavourable to him throughout. These do not make him lose heart. His challenge to the goddess of Lanka, whom he beholds deserting him, that she will be seized by force once again after killing Rama, just as she was seized before in Kubera's abode, speaks for itself, of his great sense of personal ability and high dignity. He boldly goes to the battlefield where he fights with a great terrific rage, until his death. It is only once that he feels slight fear; and that is when he thinks that Haruman may be tbat curse of Nandin, which had been flung on him for shaking the mount Kailasa, formerly.

 He is a good ruter. Lanka is very rich, beautiful and prosperous equalling Indra's city, under his rule. He is kind and courteous to his subordinates. The abduction of Sita is the only folly in Ravana, He is also foolish to think that a woman like Sita can be seduced by holding out the temptations of power, glory and riches. That he is little good at argument is seen when he fails to reply Hanuman's question as to why he cheated Rama by stealing Sita in his absence, if he is really powerful. His stubborn stand, not to yield to Rama, is both a merit and a folly in Ravana.

** Vibhishana—**Vibhishana, younger brother of Ravana is a good, pious-minded and bold prince. Although a demon by birth, he has only the virtues of men and not a single quality of the demon. He stands up boldly for the cause of truth, justice and fairplay. He does not hesitate to point out to Ravana that an envoy should not be put to death. He goes to the extant of advising him to restore Sita to her husband, as otherwise the demon race will have to face total destruction. He expresses his views plainly and is prepared to face the consequence. He loves his men and country dearly; according to his own statement, it is only to save the demon-race that he seeks the shelter of Rama. It is as a very sincere ally of Rama that be advises him to fling an arrow at Varuna if he does not allow a passage across the ocean. He is very kind and sympathetic. When Rama refuses to take back Sita, he tries to advocate her cause but is silenced by Rama.

 **Lakshmana—** We come to see very little of Lakshmana in this play. He is an obedient. brother of Rama, readily carrying out whatever he is asked to do. It is only when Rama asks him to prepare a pyre for Sita to burn herself, as desired by her, that Lakshmana hesitates to act and consults Hanuman as to what to do. This is only due to his conviction that Sita is pure and does not merit such a cruel treatment by Rama.

 **Valin—**Valin is a mighty ruler of Kishkindha. Although an ape, he is endowed with the power of argument and the descrimination of right and wrong. He is fearless and heroic. He goes to fight with Sugriva, heedless of the entreaties and warning of his own wife Tara. He tells Rama that his slaying him in a cowardly manner is an act of *adharma* Rama's reply is enough to convince him that he, as an adulterer of his younger brother's wife, merited that punishment. Before dying he forgets and forgives the offence of his younger brother Sugriva and hands over to him, his gold necklace, the family heir-loom, and entrusts his son and the future heir to the throne to his care and protection.

 **Sugriva**— Sugriva is an honest and faithful ally of Rama. He protests against Rama's taking in Vibhishana, as the demons are generally artful and full of fraud. He is far-sighted and enters into alliance with Rama only after making sure of his ability.

 **Hanuman**— Hanuman is a great hero and the trusted minister of Sugriva, following his master like a shadow even during his bad days. He does a monumental service to Rama. by leaping across the seas to Lanka, finding out Sita, delivering to her news of Rama, destroying the Asoka pak and consequently meeting Ravana, knowing his personal as well as military strength, and returning to Rama to acquaint him with Sita's condition. He takes a leading part even in the conquest of Lanka. He is very shrewd and judges persons correctly. Even in the court of Ravana, he forms a correct opinion of Vibhishana, as the one righteous person in the whole of Lanka. He is cautious and knows when and how to act. He easily wins the confidence of even Sita who hesitates to speak to him at first. His motto is implicit obedience to the master. When Lakshmana hesitates to prepare the pyre for Sita**,**even after Rama's permission, Hanuman asks him 'What is here to consider?', thus suggesting that he has simply to obey. Being such a true and faithful follower of Rama, it is no wonder that he is fondly liked by his masters and worshipped all over India.

 **Sita**—The most outstanding virtue of Sita is her unequivocal devotion to her husband and unique identification with him. She figures in this play as a suffering heroine from the beginning to the very end until the Fire God hands her to her lord. She is kept in confinement by the cruel demon Ravana, who repeatedly makes to her very filthy proposals She is harassed in various ways by the defon king and the demonesses keeping constant watch round her, that she grows quite desparate about her rescue. Even when she is rescued, her own husband refuses to take her and allows her to jump into fire. Sita patiently suffers all this. Even in her suffering her only concern is her husband. She imagines his sufferings during her separation from him and suffers doubly. She feels amply rewarded for all this when Hanuman tells her that Rama too is very much worried about her condition.

 As a worthy wife of a heroic husband, she shows great courage and firmness in defying Ravana and treating him with utmost contempt. No temptation of power, riches or comfort can seduce her. She has very tender feelings.

 She asks Hanuman to describe her condition to Rama in such a way that he may not break down in grief. Her constant prayer to god, in her misery, is that all may end well and that her lord may be happy, Although Agni says to Rama that Sita is goddess Lakshmi, all that we see of her in the play is that she is just a human being with human feelings. If she is unhurt by Fire, it is because she is pure and sinless and not because she is a goddess. Even Agni stands testimony to this. It is this purity of Sita in word, thought and deed that has elevated her to the level of a goddess.

**THE CONSECRATION**

**(Abhisheknatakam)  
———**

\[*At the end of the Nandi,* THEN *enter Stage-manager.*\]

THE STAGE-MANAGER—May He protect us;He the repeller of the obstuctors of Visvamitra's sacrifice; the extirpator of the valour of Viradha, Khara and Dushana in batlle; the slayer of Kabandha and the monkey king who were arrogant and haughty; and the leveller of the family of the king of demons.

 Thus I will announce to the noblemen. (*Having stepped forward, looking around*) But ey, what is that? Something like a voice is heard just when I am absorbed in making the announcement! Well, I see.

 (*Behind the curtian*) Sugriva, this way, this way.

(*Entering*) ASSISTANT TO THE MANAGER—Master,

 Whence indeed has arisen this sound? Mighty as it is, it spreads piercing the ears, like (the sound) of clouds roaring in the sky, moving fiercely being tossed about by furious winds.

THE STAGE-MANAGER—Don't you see, my lad? To slay Valin of the golden garland, the supreme lord of all monkeys, these are preparations of (the two persons,—viz.) Rama, the blazing torch of the Raghu family, a delight to the eyes of all the world, but with anguish caused by the rape of Sita, and Sugriva, king of all monkeys and bears, endowed with a beautiful large robust neck, but expelled from the company of his wife,—who have pledged to help each other. Therefore, these two,—

 Rama and Lakshmana have now arrived to re-install Sugriva deprived of his kingdom, just as Hari and Hara came to reinstate Indra.

\[*Exeunt ambo*\]

END OF THE PROLOGUE

\[*Then enter Rama, Lakshmana, Sugriva, and Hanuman*\]

RAMA— Sugriva, this way, this way.  
 To day, I will straightway make your enemy fall down to the ground, his body peirced, chopped and shattered by my arrows. Leave fear, O king, that Vali shall be seen by you even close to me and slain in the fight.

SUGRIVA—Sire, by your favour I can verily hope for even the realm of gods, let alone that of the monkeys. For,

 I have no doubt sire, that the arrow discharged by you now will cleave the heart of Valin. (Because) after cleaving in the great wood the seven Sala trees resembling Himalayan peaks, O glorious one, it has, with that impetus, pierced through the earth, entered the serpent's abode, passed through the ocean and come back to you, O hero.

HANUMAN—O king, through the words uttered by your lips, we are indeed with dispelled fear and ended grief. O best of Raghus, come along to the mountain resembling a water-laden cloud, in order to bestow victory on the monkey (Sugriva, Indra's son).

LAKSHMANA—Sir, Kishkindha must be close by, as the forest region (here) is with moisture.

SUGRIVA— The prince has said aright.

 Well protected by your arms, O king, we have come to Kishkindha protected well by the arms of the great monkey. You stay here, O best of men; I shall stupefy with a roar the (entire) human world with its mountains shaking.

RAMA— Well, go.

SUGRIVA— As my lord commands. (*Walking about*) Hello!

 O Ruler! Sugriva, abandoned by you for no fault, is eager to wait on your feet in battle.

 (*Behind the curtain*) How, how? Sugriva, is it?

 (*Then enter Valin with Tara clinging to his garment*)

VALIN—How, how? Sugriva, is it?

 O Tara, leave my robe, (my) lady with faultless limbs! What are you engaged in, (my dear) with (your) face and eyes wet with tears? Behold today that Sugriva with all his limbs bathedin blood, being struck down in the battle-field.

TARA—Be pleased, o great king, be pleased. Sugriva won't come with a scanty reason. You must therefore go after taking counsel with the ministers.

VALIN— Ah!  
 O moon-faced lady! let the resort of my foe be Indra, or even Siva with his sharp axe. Even Vishnu with eyes resembling the full-blown lotuses, is incapable of hitting me down, face to face with me.

TARA— Be pleased, great king, be pleased. Please do a favour to this person, at least.

VALIN—May you listen to my valour.  
 O Tara, formerly, even at the 'Nectar-churning', when I, having gone there, laughed at the (plight of the) legions of gods, danavas, and daityas and began to draw the serpent-lord of glaring eyes and fierce form, they were all astounded on seeing me.

TARA— Be pleased, great king, be pleased.

VALIN— No more; remain obedient to me; you go within.

TARA— Here I go, an unfortunate woman.                
                (Exit)

VALIN— Well; Tara has gone in. I shall (now) break the neck of Sugriva. (*Approaching hurriedly*) Sugriva, stay, stay.  
 Let Indra be your refuge, or even lord Madhusudana; having come within the range of my sight, you won't go alive.  
 This way, this way.

SUGRIVA—As the great king commands. (*Both fight with fists*)

RAMA— Here, (see) this Valin,  
 Biting his lips, with eyes reddened in rage, with protruding teeth, and roaring dreadfully having clenched tight his fists, the ape in fight shines just like the fire of annihilation which is bent on consuming (everything) completely.

LAKSHMANA— Noble brother, look at Sugriva too.  
 With eyes as red as a blossomed lotus and with his stout arms fitted with gold atmlets, he attacks the monkey-chief without paying regard to the elder and (thus) neglecting the ways of the good, being himself a monkey.

 Hit by Valin, Sugriva has fallen down.

HANUMAN—Oh fie! (*Hurriedly going near Rama*) Hail! sire, such has been his plight.  
 The monkey chief is strong, but my master is weak. Let (his present) state and (your) pledge,—all be borne in mind by your noble self.

RAMA—Hanuman, do not be anxious. Here it is attended to. (*Discharging an arrow*) Ha! Valin has fallen.

LAKSHMANA— Here, this Valin—

 With limbs stained by blood, eyes red by bleeding, and arms long but stiffened, eager to enter the region of Death,—yet attacks some how dragging bravely his body calmed of its strength being hit down by (your) powerful dart.

VALIN—(*Having fainted and again becoming conscious, after reading the name (letters) on the arrow, addressing Rama*).  
 O Rama, is it right for you to cheat me foully in battle, you—a hero, adbering to the right conduct of kings, free form doubts relating to righteous acts, and engaged in the removal of treachery among the people.  
 Alas, sir!  
 By you, a vessel of glory, a person of a gentle form and who has hit me foully, infamy has been made to shoot forth.  
 O Raghava, slaying me by stealth while I was absolved in fighting with my brother has indeed been an unworthy act for you, dressed in bark but with a mind contradicting the dress!

RAMA—How? 'Slaying by stealth has been an unworthy act.'—is that what you mean?

VALIN— What doubt ?

RAMA —Not at all so. See—  
 Slaughter of beasts by resorting to snares and hiding, is permitted. You are punished by me hiding, as you are a beast and deserve to be put to death.

VALIN—Do you think that I deserve to be punished?

RAMA— What doubt?

VALIN— For what reason?

RAMA— For adultery.

VALIN— ‘For adultery'? (But) that is a permissible act with us.

RAMA—Sir, is it right at all,  
 That you, the lord of the monkeys and able to distinguishbetween right and wrong, should possess your brother's wife on the plea of yourself being a beast?

VALIN— Only I am punished and not Sugriva, although both of us are equally guilty of possessing the wife of the brother!

RAMA— You are punished because you deserve to be punished; One who does not deserve punishment is never punished.

VALIN— The lawful wife of me, his elder brother, was embraced by Sugriva too. But how am I (alone) to be punished for embracing his wife, O Raghava?

RAMA— Because an elder brother should never touch the wife of a younger brother.

VALIN— Alas! I have no answer. As I have been punished by you, I am freed of sin, is it not?

RAMA— Be it so.

SUGRIVA— Ha, alas!  
 O best of monkeys with the gait of a lordly elephant! my heart sinks now, as it were, after seeing your two arms lying on the ground, resembling the trunks of elephants and with the armlets shattered by your enemy's weapons.

VALIN— Sugriva, don't grieve any more. Such is the course of the world.

 (*Behind the curtain*) Ha! ha! the great king!

VALIN—Sugriva, let the women folk be kept away. They should not see me in this state.

SUGRIVA —As the great king commands.Hanuman, please do so.

HANUMAN— As the prince orders.                    
        *  (Exit)*

(*Then enter Angada and Hanuman*)

HANUMAN— Angada, this way, this way.

ANGADA— Having heard that the monkey (chief), the lord of troops of bears, is passing into the hands of death, I, overwhelmed with grief, move with faltering steps.

 Hanuman, where is the great king?

HANUMAN—Here is the great king!—

 He shines (lying) on the ground, his heart pierced by an arrow, just like the best mountain Krauncha assailed by Guha's (weapon) Sakti.

ANGADA— (*Going near*) Ha, great king!

  As the lord of the apes, you were formerly sleeping happily because of your mighty power; but now you roll on the bare earth, the movement of every limb of yours ceased. Leaving behind the body which is hit down by an efficient dart, obviously do you desire to depart today to the heroes' heaven?

(*Falls on the ground*)

VALIN—Angada! do not grieve. OSugriva,

 Wiping off completly from (your) mind the wrong done by me, laying aside wrath, and leaning on righteousness, let this scion of our family be taken charge of by you, the ruler of the monkeys.

SUGRIVA— As the great king commands.

VALIN— O Raghava, please pardon the fickleness of these two monkeys, whatever their offence be.

RAMA— Very well.

VALIN— Sugriva, receive charge of this gold necklace, the treasure of our family.

SUGRIVA—I am favoured.                        
          (*Receives*)

VALIN— Hanuman, water please.

HANUMAN—As the great king commands. (*Exit, re-enter*) Here is water.

VALIN— (*Having sipped*) Life appears to leave me. These great rivers such as Ganga, and the nymphs such as Urvasi, have come to me. This aerial vehicle drawn by a thousand swans, the van of heroes, and sent by Death, has come to fetch me. Very well. Here, here I come.      
                                   
                          *(Expires)*

ALL—Ha, ha, great king!

RAMA— Alas, Valin bas gone to heaven! Sugriva, let the funeral rites be performed,

SUGRIVA— As my lord commands.

RAMA— Lakshmana, please arrange for Sugriva's consecration.

LAKSHMANA— As my noble brother commands. (*Exeunt omnes*)

END OF THE FIRST ACT

––––––––––––––––

ACT II

INTERLUDE

(Then enter Kakubha).

KAKUBHA— As the task is almost completed, all the chiefs of the monkey troops are engaged in dining. Therefore I too shall do some honour to the viands. *(Does so. Then enter Bilamukha).*

BILAMUKHA—I have been sent by the great king Sugriva (with this command)—"All the monkeys sent out to search for Sita in all the directions as a return for the help, rendered by the noble Rama, have come back. Get to know the news of Prince Angada who, among them, bad gone southwards; and come soon."Now, where on earth has the prince gone to? *(Walking about and seeing)* Here is master Kakubha. I will just ask him. (*Going near*) (Keeping) good health, sir?

KAKUBHA— Hullo, Bilamukha! whence came you?

BILAMUKHA—I have come sir, by the great king's command to see Prince Angada.

KAKUBHA— Is the noble Rama well? and the king?

BILAMUKHA—Yes.

KAKUBHA— What is the intention of the great king?

BILAMUKHA —I have been sent.............(and so on as before)

KAKUBHA—Don't you know that half the task has been accomplished?

BILAMUKHA— What, what?

KAKUBHA—Listen;  
 Having obtained from the lord of birds, news relating to Rama's wife, and mounting the great Mahendra mountain which is together with great elephants, the ocean has been leapt across now by the Wind god's son through his excessive strength in order to reach Lanka quickly.  
 Then come along; we shall wait upon the prince.

*(Exeunt ambo*)

END OF THE INTERLUDE

 *(Then enter Sita surrounded by a number of Rakshasa women)*

SITA— Alas! An unfortunate woman, I am indeed very enduring. Separated from my noble lord, brought to the palace of the demon-king, and made to listen to undesirable wicked and recklessly uttered words, I am living, a wretched woman, Or rather! I will console myself somehow through confidence in my lord's arrows. How is it that today, a little mental relief has arisen like a spray of water on the blazing ring of the black-smith's fire. Would my lord ever be of a cheerful mind without me?

(Then enter Hanuman with a ring in his hand)

HANUMAN— (Entering Lanka) Ah, the structure of Ravana's city! Rich in variegated gateways built of gold, with its spots decorated with corals and good gems, and with high (seven storied) palaces that are bright, strangely built and dense, Lanka shines like Mahendra's city in heaven.  
 And oh! indeed!  
 Possessing this unrivalled royal fortune, the ten-necked Ravana has started to destroy it by pursuing the wrong path.(*Having gone all round*) Nearly the entire Lanka has been traversed by me.  
 Many a time have I passed through the inner-most apartments and private harem chambers, through halls and stories of palaces, through bathing rooms, dwelling chambers, palaces and mansions of the demon king, and through taverns, quiet spots and dungeons. Every place has been searched; but alas! the klug's wife is not at all found by me.  
 Ah! my effort has been in vain. Well; going up the roof of the mansion, I will look round. (*Doing so*) Ey, here is a vast range of pleasure groves. Entering it, I shall search. *(Entering and seeing)* Ah! the beauty of the pleasure garden! Here, indeed—  
 With its regions beautiful on account of rows of great trees adorned with corals and sapphires set in gold, and with its more attractive mound, it shines as bright as the pleasure ground of the lord of gods in heaven.  
 More over,  
 Hillocks beautiful with gold ore and variegated springs were seen by me; ponds flocked by various kinds of water-fowls and birds were beheld by me; and places, with trees always laden with flowers and fruits were noticed by me; all this, but not Sita, was seen in Ravana's dwelling, by me.

 Who forsooth is this some one with radiance seen in this region? I will just see there. (*Doing so)* Ey, who indeed is this lady?

 Surrounded by hideous demonessess, the lady with a slender waist shines forth like a streak of lightning amidst dark clouds.

Here she,

 Wearing a single braid that resembles a black snake, with her waist that can be spanned by the hand, her mind set on her bodyemaciated by fasting, and her face bathed in tears,— looks like a wild garland of lotuses thrown away into the sun.

Ah! what is this torchlight for? (*Seeing*) Oh, it is Ravana!—

 Whose crown is set with gems; who has fine, red and large eyes; who moves along gracefully with pride; and who is as sportive as an infatuated elephant. Within the bevy of young women, this demon-king shines like a lion moving among female deer.

 What shall I do now? Well, I see. Having climbed this Asoka tree and hiding myself within its hollow, I will know the matter definitely.  
                            (*Does so*)

(*Then enter Ravana, with retinue*)

RAVANA—Sita of bewitching eyes, being indescriminate, is in love with that low warrior-ascetic and does not like me, Ravana, who with divine missiles put to flight the hosts of gods, daityas and danavas, and had (my) broad chest scarred by the thunderbolt of the tusks of the angry elephant of the gods while fighting. Oh! this is surely the obstructing tactics of fate.   
 (*Looking up*) Here, the moon,—

 A dear friend of the night-lotus groves,— with the hare-mark and the shining of a mirror made of silver, oppressing my heart by his numerous rays, is rising up spreading his splendour in the sky.

 (*Moving forward*) Here is Sita; resorting to the foot of thetree, with her heart absorbed in meditations, with her face emaciated from fasting, desiring to shrink into herself as it were, and with her breasts and waist closely concealed, she is sitting surrounded by a group of Rakshasa women, just as a digit of the moon in the midst of a shower of rain. And she—

 Discarding joys, me and this mighty fortune, with her heart fixed on a mortal, has not at all become subservient to me.

HANUMAN— Ah, it is clearly known!

 This is that princess Maithili, wife of Rama; she is trembling like a female deer frightened at the sight of a lion.

RAVANA— (*going near*) Sita, leave off this vow of a severe course. Accept me, fair lady, with all your limbs, rejecting now that mortal who is averse to the ways of love and is as good as dead, O good lady!

SITA— Silly Ravana is indeed to be laughed at, as he is not aware of the mystic effect of the words (of a curse) !

HANUMAN— (*Angrily*) Ah, the arrogance of Ravana!

 Not knowing anything of those two arms, that mighty bow and that arrow of Rama, he says that "he is as good as dead"!

 I am unable to subdue my anger. Well; I myself will accomplish the task of noble Rama. Or,—

 If I kill Ravana, there will be the accomplishment of the task; but, if the demon should hit me down, a great task will fail,

RAVANA— O lady of a fair form, of slender limbs and of lovely eyes! Loosening that braid resembling a garland of blue lotuses, take to your heart this Ten-headed (Ravana) whose limbs are adorned with various kinds of gems and precious stones, O (my) queen!

SITA—Hum! Righteousness is reversed, as this sinful demon lives.

RAVANA—And O queen!

SITA— You are cursed!

RAVANA—Ha, ha, ha! Ah! the moral power of a dutiful wife!

 Gods inclusive of Indra and others, and the danavas were crushed by me in battle: I, such a person, am embarassed by the three syllables of Sita.

 (*Behind the curtain*) Victory to His Majesty! Victory to the Lord of Lanka! Victory to our master! Victory to the great king! Ten nadikas are over. The bathing time passes. This way, great king, this way. (*Exit Ravana with retinue*)

HANUMAN,— Good! Ravana is gone and the Rakshasa women are asleep. This is the time to approach the queen. (*Coming down from the hollow*) Hail to the lady with a long-lived husband!

 Iam sent by king Rama, whose courage is well known and whose mind is distressed by anguish through love for you.

SITA— *(To herself)* Who, indeed, can this be? That wicked Rakshasa, under the guise of a monkey, might be trying to deceive me by pretending himself as one related to my lord. Well, I shall remain silent.

HANUMAN— Why? Don't you believe me? Cease to have any suspicion that I am a different person. Please listen―

 I am the monkey named Hanuman, sent to search for you by the monkey-king after entering into an alliance with (Rama), the light of the Ikshvaku race.

SITA— (*To herself*) Be he who he may; I will talk to him as he has uttered the name of my husband. (*Aloud*) Good sir, what news of my lord?

HANUMAN—Listen, lady—

 He bears a pining body, bereft of fortitude, scorched by the arrows of the mind-born, with eyes filled with tears, subjected to pain by fasting, pale, with an emaciated face and with its grace and charm removed through brooding over your excellent virtues.

SITA— (*To himself)* Alas! unfortunate me! I am ashamed to heas that my lord grieves thus. I see that even the pain of separation of my lord has borne fruit on me, in case this monkey is speaking truth. Hearing of my husband's love and suffering for this person (i.e. myself), my heart is swinging, as it were, between joy and sorrow. (*Aloud*) Good sir, how came my lord's alliance with you monkeys?

HANUMAN— Please listen, lady.

 The kingdom of the monkeys was made Sugriva's (by Rama) after slaying his elder brother Valin, the celebrated, ape in a battle for your sake, O princess! Therefore, monkeys were sent in all directions to search for you, by our king. I, one of them have come to you to day, O queen, through the (guiding) words of a vulture.

 Moreover, thus.............

SITA— Oh pitiless are the gods in making my husband thus sorrowful.

HANUMAN— Lady, do not grieve. For, Rama,—

 Holding firm his great bow and surrounded by an army of monkeys, will invade this very Lanka to extirpate the ten-necked Ravana.

SITA—Indeed, is it only a dream seen by me? Good sir, is it true? I know not.

HANUMAN— (*To himself*) Alas!

 This lady, so full of love for her lord,-being oppressed by grief, does not believe it even after recognising her husband quite well, as if she has migrated into another body.

 (*Aloud*) Lady, now—

 I will bring here your lord with the upraised mighty bow and arrows in his hand. O princess! you will be freed of doubts relating to me, once you are by the side of that great person, with your sorrow appeased.

SITA— Good sir, relate my news in such a manner that my lord may not be oppressed by grief on hearing this plight of mine.

HANUMAN—As your ladyship commands.

SITA— Go; may there be success in your under-taking.

HANUMAN— Thank you. (*Moving about*) Now, how shall I communicate my arrival to Ravana? Well, I see

 I shall rid the demon-king of his pride of a beautiful country by pulverizing with blows from my hands and feet, this garden full of flocks of cuckoos, lovely with lotus beds, with very beautiful groves of trees, and with its three peaks resembling clouds.

(*Exeunt ambo*)

END OF THE SECOND ACT

–––––––––––––––––––

ACT III

(Then enter Sankukarna)

SANKUKARNA—Hello, who is here on duty at the 'Golden Gate Entrance'?

(*Entering*) PORTRESS—Sir, it is I, Vijaya. What shall I do for you?

SANKUKARNA— O Vijaya, convey immediately to His Majesty the Lord of Lanka that the Asoka Garden is almost destroyed. For,

 That Asoka Garden,—where even Mandodari, our lord's chief queen, although fond of ornaments does not pluck the sprays out of kindness; wherein even the Malaya breeze does not blow out of fear; and whose plants are untouched by the hand;—that garden of Indra's foe is destroyed. Let the matter be reported. 

PORTRESS—Sir, in a person who is always in attendance on the king, such fright was never seen before. How came this?

SANKUKARNA—Lady, this is an urgent matter. Please convey (it) at once.

PORTRESS— Sir, here I convey.                     
               (*Exit*)

SANKUKARNA— (*Looking in front*) Lo! Here is His Majesty the Lord of Lanka coming this very way. And he,

 With eyes wild and resembling white lotuses, with blazing golden torches going in his front, full of fury he is rushing forward in haste like the Sun engaged in ending an Age (*yuga*).

(Then enter Ravana, as described)

RAVANA—Hello, speaker of new words! I am listening; speak out at once. How and by which fearless fellow courting death have I been rudely abused by destroying the park?

SANKUKARNA— (*going near*) Victory to the great king! By a strange monkey that came in unnoticed, the Asoka garden has been violently crushed.

RAVANA— *(with contempt)* How, by a monkey, is it? go; having caught him at once, bring him.

SANKUKARNA— As the great king commands!                
             *(Exit)*

RAVANA— Well, well;

  If this disagreeable thing has been done by the gods to me, the creator of terror to the three worlds in battle, then, let those nectar-eaters soon reap the fruit arising from their insolence.

*(Entering)* SANKUKARNA – Victory to the great king! Sir, that monkey is indeed very strong. By him the Sala trees were pulled out like lotus-stalks, the wooden hillock was smashed with a fist, the creeper-houses were squeezed by the palm of his hands, and the guards of the pleasure garden were rendered unconcious with a mere roar. Your Majesty will be pleased to order a force capable of capturing him.

RAVANA— Then order the 'Thousand Slaves' force to captivate the monkey.

SANKUKARNA—As the great king commands! (*Exit, re-enter)* Victory to the great king!

 Our slaves of great strength were killed in no time with our own great trees by that tree-weaponed fighter.

RAVANA—How? Killed, you say? Then bid prince Aksha capture the monkey.

SANKUKARNA—As the great king commands.

RAVANA— *(Reflecting)*

 As the prince is well versed in weapons, heroic and strong, he may either catch the monkey by force, or even slay him.

*(Entering*) SANKUKARNA– Your Majesty Will be pleased to order the next force.

RAVANA— Why?

SANKUKARNA— Pray listen, my liege. Seeing the prince going out (to attack the monkey), five generals, even without orders from your Majesty, followed him.

RAVANA—Then, then?

SANKUKARNA—Then prince Aksha,—

 His eyes red with rage, was driving his chariot yoked with swiftest horses and was pouring out networks of arrows with the greatest ease like the clouds of the rainy season; the monkey too, blowing off those arrows, straightway leaping into that chariot (of Aksha) and seizing him by the throat, killed him with his fist, grinning with great joy.

RAVANA— *(Angrily)* Ah! killed him?

 You stay here, I myself will go for this insignificant monkey and in no time reduce him to ashes with the sparks of the fire of my anger.

SANKUKARNA—Be pleased, be pleased your majesty! Hearing that Prince Aksha was slain, Prince Indrajit, his heart full of anger, went to attack the monkey.

RAVANA— Then go; get further news.

SANKUKARNA—As my liege commands.                   
          *(Exit)*

RAVANA—Verily, the prince is well trained in weapons and

 Necessarily, in battle there must be either death or victory to heroes. Yet, this creature of vile deed is of some mental worry to me.

*(Entering)* SANKUKARNA—Victory to the great king! Victory to the Lord of Lanka!Victory to the blessed-faced king!

 There came np a tumultuous fight between him and the prince. Thereafter, the monkey was swiftly bound down with ropes, be fittingly.

RAVANA—What wonder in this that a monkey has been caught by Indra's conquerer! Hello, who is there?

*(Entering)* DEMON–Victory to the great king!

RAVANA—Go; let Vibhishana be summoned.

DEMON—As the great king bids.                     
          *  (Exit)*

RAVANA —You too; just bring that monkey.

SANKUKARNA— As the great king bids.                  
        *(Exit)*

RAVANA— *(Reflecting)* Oh, alas!

 Lanka cannot be thought of by gods and demons (although) united, even within their minds. Yet a monkey has indeed entered it defying the ten-necked (me)!

 Moreover,—

 After conquering the triple world with its gods and demons in battle and proceeding proudly to Kailasa, I, having shaken Siva, together with his queen, and surrounded by his ganas, obtained a boon from him; but again a curse was laid on me by Parvati and Nandi as they were not paid any regard (by me). Could it be that (curse operating now) on me, through the disguised form of a monkey!

(Then enter Vibhishana)

VIBHISHANA—(*Thoughtfully)* Alas! how perverse indead has the king's mind become ! For,

 Many a time he has been asked by me to restore Maithili to him (Rama). (But,) he does not listen to my words for the misery of his friends.

 (*Going near*) May the great king be victorious!

RAVANA— Vibhishana, come near; sit down.

VIBHISHANA—Yes, here I sit down.                   
         *(Sits*)

RAVANA —Vibhishana, I find you somewhat depressed.

VIBHISHANA—Depression is but natural in the servant serving a master who does not appreciate a well spoken word.

RAVANA—Please end this talk, You too, just bring the monkey.

VIBHISHANA— As the great king commands.                
     * (Exit)*

(Then enter Hanuman held by Demons)

ALL—Ah, this way, this way.

HANUMAN—I was not at all defeated by that wicked demon. I voluntarily got captured, with a desire to see the demon-king. (*Going near*) O King! are you well?

RAVANA— (*with contempt*) Vibhishana, was all that the doing of this fellow?

VIBHISHANA—Sire, much more than that.

RAVANA—How do you know?

VIBHISHANA—Your majesty will please ask him—"Who are you?"

RAVANA— O monkey, who are you? Why have you been impudent and entered my (ladies') inner apartments?

HANUMAN— You may listen;

 I am the direct son of the Wind-god born of Anjana; and the monkey named Hanuman sent (here) by Raghava.

VIBHISHANA— Sire, did you hear?

RAVANA—What if I heard?

VIBHISHANA—Hanuman, what says the noble Raghava?,

HANUMAN— Sir, You may listen to the command of Rama.

RAVANA—How, how? You say— 'the command of Rama'? Ah! let this monkey be put to death.

VIBHISHANA— Be appeased, be appeased, great king! Envoys are never to be put to death, whatever their offence. Further, after hearing Rama's message first, then your majesty may act as you please.

RAVANA— O monkey, what says that mortal?

HANUMAN— You may listen;

 "Seek the best protection; or go to Siva; or enter into the most impenetrable underworld. Into the abode of death, I will send you with all your limbs cleft by (my) excellent arrows."  
.....So it is.

RAVANA—Ha, ha, ha!

 With divine weapons, legions of gods have been defeated by me. All the demon-chiefs are obedient to me. Even Kubera has been humbled being robbed of his aerial car. How can Rama, a mortal go to fight with me, fellow?

HANUMAN—By you, so great a person, why was bis wife carried away stealthily?

VIBHISHANA—Hanuman has spoken aright.

 O demon hero! she was indeed brought away stealthily by you putting on the guise of a begger, after luring away Rama by an illusion.

RAVANA— Vibhishana, how is it you take the side of my foe?

VIBHISHANA—Be pleased, O king! My words are for (your) good. Please give back the dutiful wife of Raghava; for, I don't wish (that) this family (of ours should) be destroyed by you, a demon-hero.

RAVANA— Vibhishana, do not fear.

 How can a long-maned lion be slain by a deer? or a mighty infatuated elephant be killed by a fox ?

HANUMAN— O Ravana, is it proper on the part of you, whose lot is at stake, to speak thus of Raghava? O! do not (speak thus).  
 You accursed demon, Ravana, whose merits are completely exhausted! Is it right for you to speak low thus of Raghava, the foremost of heroes, without a peer, almost an equal of Indra, and the sole lord of the whole world? you worthless fellow !

RAVANA— How now? He addresses me by name? Let this monkey be put to death. Nay, killing an envoy would remain a scandal. O Sankukarna, after setting fire to his tail, release this  
monkey.

SANKUKARNA—As the great king commands. This way, this way.

RAVANA— Or, just come here.

HANUMAN— Here Iam.

RAVANA— Relate to that mortal this message of mine. —  
 "Rama, you have been abused by me, by the abduction of your wife. If there is in you the pride of an archer, you may give me a great fight."

HANUMAN— Before long, you will see,—  
 Being vanquished by the mere twang of Rama's bow (you will see) your Lanka with its excellent but demolished gates, towers, and palaces and encompassed with its pleasure gardens devastated by troops of monkeys all round.

RAVANA—Ah! let this monkey be turned out.

DEMON— This way, this way.                      
 * (Exit Hanuman with demons)*

VIBHISHANA— Be pleased, great king! There is something I wish to say for the good of your majesty.

RAVANA— Speak out, we too shall listen to that good.

VIBHISHANA— I feel that an utter destruction of the demon-race has drawn near.

RAVANA— But why?

VIBHISHANA— Because of your majesty's unworthy behaviour.

RAVANA— What is that unworthy behaviour of mine?

VIBHISHANA— Why, just the abduction of Sita.

RAVANA— What harm in the abduction of Sita ?

VIBHISHANA— A breach of dharma and—

RAVANA— By that word and, your sentence is incomplete. Speak it out.

VIBHISHANA— Why, that is all.

RAVANA—Vibhishana, why do you hide (things)? You are conjured on my life, if you should fail to speak the truth.

VIBHISHANA—Your majesty should deign to give an assurance of "no fear".

RAVANA—The assurance of 'no fear' is given. Now speak out.

VIBHISHANA.... ....and hostility with a powerful foe,

RAVANA— (*Angrily*) How, how? Hostility with a powerful foe.' —you say?

 Taking the side of my foe, this base demon, without fear, speak to me harshly provoking my anger.

 Ey, Who is there?

 I don't like to see in front of me a person who, disregarding my fraternal affection, has taken the side of my foe; so let him be banished.

VIBHISHANA— Be pleased, be pleased, great king! I will go myself.  
 Punished by you, O king, I go; and I am not guilty. Leaving wrath and lust, act as you should,

 (*Walking along*) And now,  
 This very day, having resorted to Rama of lotus eyes and dreadful bow, who has taken a vow for slaying Ravana, and who is a god among men, reknown (as striving) for the good of his refugees, I shall once again raise the demon race which has (almost) perished.      *(Exit)*

RAVANA—Alas! Vibhishana is gone. I too shall arrange for guarding the town.     *   (Exit)*

END OF THE THIRD ACT

––––––––––––––

ACT IV

(Then enters a Monkey-Chamberlain)

THE CHAMBERLAIN—Hello, general! give an 'alert' command to the monkey army.

(*Entering)* GENERAL—Sir, what for, this preparation?

THE CHAMBERLAIN— News of Sita, the wife of noble Rama, has been brought by the worthy Hanuman.

GENERAL—What is that news?

THE CHAMBERLAIN—Listen. The princess, it is stated, is in Lanka, sorely oppressed by grief being harassed by Ravana Who is defying all virtuous conduct. Hence, by our king, seeking to accomplish the object of Rama whose mind is scorched by intense grief on hearing this, the formidable army of the monkeys has been given orders to prepare.

GENERAL— Very well; as bis majesty commands.

THE CHAMBERLAIN—I too shall report to the great king that the monkey army is prepared.                           
                                   
 (*Exeunt ambo*)

END OF THE INTERLUDE

(Then enters Rama, Lakshmana, Sugriva and Hanuman)

RAMA— Mountains, huge as clouds and dense with thickets on their broad ridges, have been ascended; rivers, the water of which is drunk by lions, tigers, and lordly elephants have been crossed also by me; a great wonderful forest full of trees richly laden with flowers and fruits, has been passed through; and now, I have come along with the army of the monkey-king to the sea-shore.

LAKSHMANA—Here is the divine lord of waters!

 With watery sapphires dark as the rainy clouds, with beautiful garlands of the uptossed foamy waves, and with a thousand arms of the incoming streams, the lord of rivers shines like Vishnu reposing.

RAMA— And how now?

 Ready to destroy the foe, I have fixed an arrow on my bow; (and) in order to retain him alive, this ocean obstructs me.

SUGRIVA— Ey, in the sky,—

 Shining like a rainy cloud and with limbs sparkling with bright ornaments of gold, why does this demon rush thither like a moth to fall soon into fire.

HANUMAN—Ye, monkey warriors! be on your guard.

 Let the monkey-chiefs now stand firmly in battle for the destruction of the demon, with rocks, trees, fists, teeth, claws, knees and furious roars; and protect our king.

RAMA— 'A demon,'—is it? Hanuman, be not excited.

HANUMAN— As the sire commands.

(Then enters Vibhishana)

VIBHISHANA—Oh! I have come to Raghava's camp spot. *(Reflecting)* How should the respectable Rama recognise me, when I have not sent to him any messenger, when my arrival is not intimated to him, and when I am a relation of his foe? For,—

 My heart is anxious as to what the king of the Raghus will say to me, the younger brother of that furious enemy of the gods, (viz. Ravana,) before whom even (Indra) the wielder of the thunderbolt, together with the gods, is unable to stand in the battle.

Or,

 How could this pious Rama who has seen the reality underlying the meaning of dharma, and who is affectionate towards his refugees, be doubted by me of a pure mind!

 *(Looking down)* This is the camp of the bull-like hero of the Raghu house. I will get down. *(Alighting)* Well, staying here I shall report my arrival to his lordship.

HANUMAN— *(Looking upwards)* Ey, what? Is it His Highness Vibhishana?

VIBHISHANA—Ey, it is Hanuman! O Hanuman, report to this lordship my arrival.

HANUMAN—Very well. *(Going near)* Victory to your lordship!  
 O king, here has come seeking shelter the virtuous-minded Vibhishana, banished from his land by his brother, just on your account.

RAMA— What? Vibhishana has come for shelter, is it? Dear  
 Lakshmana, go, with honour usher Vibhishana in.

LAKSHMANA— As my brother bids.

RAMA—Sugriva, I see you are eager to speak.

SUGRIVA— My lord, the demons are fraudful fighters and of great witchery. Therefore, after due consideration, let Vibhishana be admitted.

HANUMAN— Nay, not so, great king.

 I deem that Vibhishana is as loyal as we are towards your lordship. Once before, in the city (Lanka), he has been seen by me, even as disputing with his brother.

RAMA—If so, go; with honour admit Vibhishana,

LAKSHMANA—As my brother bids. *(Going out)* Ey, (here is) Vibhishana! O Vibhishana, are you well?

VIBHISHANA—Oh! It is Prince Lakshmana. Prince, now, I have become well.

LAKSHMANA—Vibhishana, let us just go near the sire.

VIBHISHANA—Very well.                         
   *(They both go near him*)

LAKSHMANA— Victory to my noble brother!

VIBHISHANA— May it please your lordship! May your lordship be victorious!

RAMA— Ey, it is Vibbishana! Vibhishana, are you well?

VIBHISHANA— My lord, now I have become well.

 Having come for shelter to you whose eyes resemble lotus petals and who is a worthy refuge, O king, I have now become well, freed of sin on seeing you.

RAMA— From this day, be the lord of Lanka, by my command.

VIBHISHANA— I am beholden to you.

RAMA—Vibhishana, by your very arrival our task has been : accomplished. The means of crossing the ocean is indeed not known.

VIBHISHANA— My lord, what is to be known as regards that? If he does not give passage, you will do well just to discharge a divine missile at the ocean.

RAMA—Good, Vibhishana, good. Be it so. I will just do that,

(Suddenly getting up, angrily)

 If he does not give me a passage, I shall soon make him such that the roars of his waves are stilled, his, water and mud are dried up by my arrows, and his earthy bottom is strewn with hundreds of dead fishes.

(Then enter Varuna)

VARUNA— *(Alarmed)* I am guilty of offence against Narayana, who has put on a human form; therefore, afraid of my lord's arrow that destroys the bodies of the foes of gods, I will at once go seeking protection, to him.

 *(Seeing)* Ey, here is the divine lord!

 Putting on a human form and bearing a discus, bow, and mace, Himself the cause of everything, He has arrived here seeking to accomplish some task.

 Salutations to the divine Narayana, the cause of the three worlds!

LAKSHMANA— *(Seeing)* Ey, who, indeed, is this?

 He has his head adorned with jems and his long eyes are beautiful and red. He is dark as a fresh blue lotus and has the gait of an elephant in rut. Risen out of the midst of the vast waters, with his lustre he seems to make the world of living beings bow down soon before him.

VIBHISHANA— My lord, here has come the godly Varuna.

RAMA— Is this Varuna? O divine Varuna, salutation to you.

VARUNA— The lord of the gods should not salute me. Or,

 O prince, whence your wrath? Wherefore your excessive ire?

O best of men, just say soon what has to be done by us.)

RAMA—You will please give (us) a passage to go to Lanka.

VARUNA— Here is the passage; you may go.               
       *(Disappears)*

RAMA— How is it the divine Varuna has already disappeared? Vibhishana, behold the lord of the waters with motionless waves by the favour of the divine lord.

VIBHISHANA— My lord! Now, the ocean looks cut into two, as it were.

RAMA—Where is Hanuman?

HANUMAN— Hail my lord!

RAMA— Hanuman, lead the way.

HANUMAN—As my lord commands.                     
        *(All move on)*

RAMA— *(Seeing with surprise)* Dear Lakshmana, friend Vibbishana, great king Sugriva, friend Hanuman, all of you behold. Ah, the loveliness of the ocean! For, here—

 It belches out foam in one place and has its water infested by fishes in another; in one part, it is covered with shells and in another has the hue of a blue cloud; on one side, it has a row of billows and on another is fearful with crocodiles; here it is with a dreadful whirpool and there with still water.

 By the favour of the divine lord, the ocean has been crossed!

HANUMAN— My lord, this is Lanka.

RAMA— *(Gazing for a long time)* Alas, the beauty of the demon's city will be destroyed before long.

 Broken by blows of the blasts of my eminent arrows and the sides (*of it)* struck down by the waves of the hosts of monkey chiefs, it will sink like a ship lost amidst the ocean waters by the fault of the pilot Ravana.

 Sugriva. pitch the camp on this Suvela hill,            
              *(Sits)*

SUGRIVA—As my lord commands. Nila, do so.               
       * (Enter Nila)*

NILA—As the great king commands. (*Exit and re-enter*) May my lord be victorious! While the armies were being encamped in an order, and when the persons constituting the troops were being checked with reference to the registers, two monkeys who are not recognisable from any source of evidence were caught. We know not what to do with them. Therefore your lordship must decide.

RAMA—Soon bring them in.

NILA—As my lord commands.                      
             *   (Exit)*

 (*The enter Nila; so also Suka and Sarana disguised as monkeys, handcuffed and held by monkeys.)*

MONKEYS—Ye fellows, speak out; who are you?

BOTH— Master, we are Mr. Kumuda's servants.

MONKEYS—Sire, they pretend as Mr. Kumuda's servants.

VIBHISHANA— *(Attentively having gazed at Suka and Sarana)  
 *These are not our soldiers and these are not monkeys too. Theseare the demons Suka and Sarana sent by Ravana.

BOTH— *(To themselves)* Ah! we have been recognised by the Prince. *(Aloud)* Sir, seeing the demon race in danger by the perversity of the demon king, and not getting any place (there), we came disguised as monkeys seeking the refuge of your. noble self.

RAMA— Friend Vibhishana, how do you feel?

VIBHISHANA— My lord,

 These two are the favourite ministers of the demon king. O lord of men! never will they desert the king of Lanka even in a fatal calamity.

 Therefore your lordship may order a suitable punishment.

RAMA— Vibhishana, Nay; not so.

 By just punishing these two, there won't be any gain to me;neither will there be any loss to the demon king. Therefore set them free.

LAKSHMANA— If they are to be set free, may your lordship order for their release after they have entered and examined all our army.

RAMA—Lakshmana has said aright. Nila, please do so.

NILA— As my lord commands.

RAMA— Or, come here please.

BOTH—Here we are.

RAMA—Please convey this mes age of mine to that demon king. "Forced to take this war-fare by yourself through the abduction of my wife, I have come as a guest of war desirous of seeing you, (but) do not see you (at all)."

BOTH— As your lordship commands.                   
     * (Exeunt ambo)*

RAMA—Vibhishana, we too shall examine the entire army.

VIBHISHANA—As my lord commands.

RAMA— *(Moving along and looking round)* Ey! the divine Sun has set. For, now—

 Having gone to the summit of the setting mountain, with his rays contracted and body reddened by the twilight, the sun shines like the *Pulaka* ornament made of gold (adorning) an elephant's forehead covered with a bright red silk.

(Exeunt omnes)

END OF THE FOURTH ACT

ACT V

(Then enter a demon Chamberlain)

THE DEMON CHAMBERLAIN—Hello, who is here on duty at the Coral-gate Entrance?                               
                      *(Another Demon entering)*

DEMON— Sir, it is I; what shall I do (for you)?

CHAMBERLAIN—Go; please call Vidyujjihva by the king's order.

DEMON— Well, sir.                           
 *  (Exit)*

CHAMBERLAIN— Alas! Even now the mind of the king has not gained sedateness, although all (his) resources in the demon race whose prosperity is in danger has failed, the heroic warriors are killed, and himself has encountered danger to his own life. For, who, indeed—

 Would not make peace by restoring his wife to him, even after seeing the sea crossed by him?— the sea, with its dreadful shore hit back by the rolling waves and with the blue waters full of alligators rising up.

 Moreover,

 Heroes such as Prahasta, Kumbhakarna and others have been killed to day by Raghava; and even Indrajit has gone.  
 Even in such a plight,

 Overpowered by lust and disregarding the ministers' words, this proud hero, keen on fighting, does not give back Janaka's daughter, the queen of that bull of Raghu race, in order to (face) a great,misfortune.

*(Entering)* VIDYUJJIHVA — How do you do, sir?

THE CHAMBERLAIN—Vidyujjihva, go; please bring the likeness of the heads of Rama and Lakshmana by the order of the king.

VIDYUJJIHVA— As the king commands.                  
                *(Exit)*

THE CHAMBERLAIN—I too shall go and wait on the king.         
            *(Exit)*

END OF THE INTERLUDE

(Then enter Sita surrounded by a group of demonesses)

SITA— How is it, my heart which was delighted by my lord's arrival is somewhat uneasy, now! Bad omens too, are noticed. Even thus, my heart's joy is now increasing. By every means, let the gods make it blissful (for me).

(Then enter Ravana)

RAVANA— O! forbid (this).

 This lady Lanka, who has a fresh white lotus held in her hand, and who was seized after conquering Kubera quickly in battle when she thus came to my possession, is now going forth leaving my abode.

 Stay, lady, stay. Not at all should you go. Do you say—

 Leaving you, I go to Rama? Ah! pack off. only by force then, in Kubera's abode. I will seize you (once again) by force only after killing Raghava in a battle.

 What of her? I will just allure Sita. (*Gesticulating the influence of love)* Ah! How great the incomparable power of the flower-bowed god! For—

 Beholding Sita's face, my eyes forget sleep during the night. Coveting for the joy of her embrace, my body grown thinner has gained a paleness and bears suffering in respect of a lovely object. Alas! Ravana, whose arms subdued the three worlds, is being vanquished by the flower-arrowed god.

 (*Going near*) O Sita, with eyes resembling lotus leaves! abandon your mind set on a mortal, O mistress of my heart! See today,, your heart's beloved together with Lakshmana, felled by my weapon in the battle-field.

SITA—Humph! you are a silly roarer, as you wish to balance the Mandara mountain by the hand.

(*Entering*) DEMCN—Victory to the great king!

 These two heads are of those two mortal princes secured, after slaying in battle, by our prince seeking to do good to you.

RAVANA— Sita, see; see the heads of those two mortals.

SITA—Ha, my lord!                           
          (*Falls unconscious*)

RAVANA—Sita! abandoning your love for this mortal who is dead,secure this very day a great fortune, O large-eyed lady!

SITA— *(Recovering)* Alas, my lord! to gaze at the upturned eyes indeed, in your face resembling a fragrant fresh lotus, I have been very hard-hearted, unfortunate me! Ha, my lord! Having cast me into this ocean of misery, where have you gone? I do not die even. Could all this be false? Good sir, with the same sword with which this dreadful deed was wrought on my lord, slay me too.

RAVANA— When that wretch together with his brother Lakshmana has been clearly slain by Indrajit in battle, by whom shall you be released?

 (*Behind the curtain*) By Rama, by Rama...............

SITA— Live long !

*(Entering*) RAKSHASA — (*Excited*) By Rama, by Rama............

RAVANA— What do you mean by "By Rama"?

RAKSHASA—Pray, pardon, great king! In my haste to report to you urgent news, the peculiar situation (of yours) was not paid heed to.

RAVANA— Speak, speak; what has been done by that mortal ascetic?

RAKSHASA—Deign to listen, great king! Indeed, he,—  
 Raghava of excessive courage and great strength, together with Lakshmana, having overpowered you soon, has slain your son by force.

RAVANA—Ha villain! coward!

Would ever Indrajit be slain by a mortal in fight, when gods inclusive of Indra have been vanquished, and daityas turned away by him ?

RAKSHASA—Be pleased, be pleased, great king. A lie about the prince is never told to your majesty.

RAVANA— Ha my child, Meghanada! *(Falls down in a swoon)*

RAKSHASA— Great king! take heart, take heart.

RAVANA—*(Recovering)* Ha! my child, versed in arms, and a torment to all worlds! Alas! my dear conqueror of Indra, with the whole group of your enemies humbled! Alas my son ! O hero, dear to your parents and skilled in fight! Alas! my dear boy!

why have you gone away leaving me here?               
         *    (Swoons)*

RAKSHASA—Out with it, alas! The lord of Lanka, the conqueror of the triple world, has been brought to this state by the accursed fate! Great king, take heart, take heart.

RAVANA —*(Recovering)* Now, what good is this Sita, the cause of misfortune? and this fickle fortune who will be useless even after the conquest of the three worlds? What, oh, acursed death! even now, are you shivering with fear?

 Devoid of affection and without the dear son Indrajit, O misery! this hard-hearted Ravana lives still.

(Falls down in grief)

RAKSHASA—Ho, you demon heroes! when the king is in such a circumstance, you the guards in the inner apartments, should be watchful.

*(Behind the curtain)* Hello, you demon warriors, turning your backs timidly in fright caused by the ocean-like army getting despirited by the death of Prahasta, Nikumbha, Kumbhakarna and Indrajit in the van of battle! This timorous fight does not become of you, who have won battles against the gods successively; and more so when our master, the lord of Lanka, adorned with his twenty arms reknown for conquering the entire universe, is still here.

RAVANA— *(Listening angrily)* Go, get more news.

RAKSHASA—As the great king commands! *(Exit, re-enter)* Victory, great king! This Rama,

 Having fixed an arrow to his bow ignoring you in his arrogance and having slain your son in the van of the fight, he, with the train of his monkey-troops, his eyes wide open as he is smiling, —is rushing towards Lanka, as if to set it ablaze.

RAVANA— *(Suddenly rising in rage)* Where is he? where is he?     
(*Raising his sword)*.

 This sword, whose edge is hardened by the cleaving of the wide temples of the elephants of Indra and which I hold in my hand here, shall make you an offering to my wrath. Let the gods protect you. Vile fellow, whither are you going? Stay, stay; you miserable ascetic.

RAKSHASA— O great king, do not be too rash.

SITA— Very soon there shall be the death of Ravana who now does unpleasant, unworthy and purposeless deeds.

RAVANA—On account of this woman, so many brothers, sons and friends of mine have been slain. Hence, having cleaven her heart, the home of enmity, and adorned with the garl and of her entrails, I shall destroy the whole host of monkeys together with the two mortals with a blow from my sword which is like a thunderbolt.

RAKSHASA—Be pleased, be pleased O king! Enough of endless vain efforts against the arrogance of the enemy's army, now. And surely a woman should not be put to death.

RAVANA—Well then, get my chariot.

RAKSHASA— As the great king commands. *                
   (Exit and re-enter)*

 Victory to the great king! Here is the chariot.

RAVANA— *(Mounting the chariot)*

 Today Sita, you shall see Rama surrounded by gods (and) his heart beset with sharp arrows shot from my bow.

(Exit Rama with retinue)

SITA— O gods! If I have been following my lord with the faithfulness beseeming my family (tradition), may my lord be victorious.

(Exit)

ACT VI

(Then enter three Vidyadharas)

ALL— Here we are, sir, here we are.

THE FIRST—Rama is the large, bright and radiant standard of the Ikshvaku race.

THE SECOND—Rama bas aimed at the destruction of Ravana.

THE THIRD—Our minds are filled with eagerness to behold their fight.

ALL— (Hence) we have swiftly arrived (here) from the peak of the Himalayas.

THE FIRST—Chitraratha! these gods, godly sages, Siddhas. Vidyadharas, and such others are here crowded in the sky. Hence, we too, avoiding the groups of these and remaining aloof, shall freely behold the strange fight between Rama and Ravana.

BOTH— Very well.                           
                  *(They do so)*

THE FIRST—Lo! This battlefield is an abhoring sight. Here, indeed,  
 This battlefield appears like an ocean flooded with the water- like corpses of demons, full of wave-like monkey heroes, (infested) with sharp swords that are like crocodiles, and where the tides surge with the beam-like arrows of the moon-resembling, Rama.

THE SECOND—Just so.

 These Rakshasa troops, their heads broken with trees and rocks, slain by blows from the fists, surrounded by the enraged monkey captains who are of great might and have their tails and ears made erect, with eyes upturned and protruding as they are strangled, and with faces fierce on account of bitten lips-are rapidly felled in the fight, like mountains by the thunderbolt of Indra.

THE THIRD— And these too, should be seen by both of you;

 With sharp and bright swords, with eyes widened by rage, with shining but hideous teeth, these demons resembling blue clouds, are rushing in from all sides, with mouths gaping in their speed, desirous of slaying the troops of the leaders of the monkey host.

THE FIRST—Oh, indeed!

 Arrows are showered by the Rakshasas upon the monkeys;

THE SECOND—Mountains are hurled by the monkeys upon the demons;

THE THIRD—And with blows from fists and the intertwining of knees;

ALL—Lo, a terrible and strange fight has started.

THE FIRST—Look at Ravana, both of you!

 Whirling a spear of gold handle and driving the chariot, displaying bright and hideous teeth, and furious on seeing Rama, like the planet (Rahu) on beholding the full-orbed moon, lord of all the stars, on the central peak of the East Mount.

THE SECOND—Behold Rama too,—

 Holding the bow in his left hand and turning a fierce good arrow by the other, himself standing on the earth and gazing at the foe seated in the chariot, just as the war-god (Kartikeya) gazes in battle at the great Krauncha mountain.

THE THIRD—Ha, ha, ha!

 This spear, resembling Death and hurled by Ravana, has been split into two by the smiling archer Rama.

THE FIRST—Beholding his spear hit down, Ravana, with eyes widened by rage, is pouring a shower of arrows upon Rama.

THE SECOND—Ah, the beauty of Rama!

 These arrow-showers pouring down from the cloud Ravana and falling on Rama, look like a shower of water pouring on a bull.

THE THIRD— And here, (he)

 Swiftly raising his virile bow made of gold and throwing out a dreadful net-work of arrows in the van of the fight, advances on foot towards Ravana, mounted on a chariot and rushing against him like a sharp-toothed lion advancing towards a rutting tusker.

ALL—Ey, this place is lit up, as it were, with a radiance, What could this be?

THE FIRST— Ah! It is the chariot driven by Matali and sent by the great Indra, who is apprehensive, as the fight is so equal !

THE SECOND—Seeing Matali standing by his side, Rama has mounted the chariot, on his words.

THE THIRD— And he,

 Being instrumental to the demon's destruction, shines in this chariot which is the destroyer of Diti's children and the guide for Indra's victory and valour; just as Siva (who shone) before, at the massacre of the Three Cities.

THE FIRST—Oh, a great fight has come off!

 These soldiers of the monkey-chief and the demon having given up the hurling of different weapons. stand simply gazing at the fight between the demon and the king of men, wherein the sharp arrows are swallowed by the excellent shafts.

THE SECOND—Ah, indeed!

 These two seated in chariots moving round and round with warlike motion, and emitting flights of arrows, are like two Suns wandering in the sky, scorching the earth through the networks of their rays.

THE THIRD—Both of you look at Ravana also, who

 Having hit down the horses with arrows of terrible speed and swiftly having attacked the banner by force, has been roaring and creating a great shower of arrows and is trying much to frighten the lord of men who is smiling.

THE FIRST— This Rama—

 His body dwarfed as he stands firm repelling a charge and after taking breath a little seeing a pointed arrow with blood red eyes, and glowing like the midday Sun, the heroic lord of men is given a clear course by Matali himself; and enraged the king has fixed the unrivalled excellent missile presided over by Brahma,

THE SECOND—This missile,

 Discharged by the force of Rama's arm, its sharp edge associated with Fire and Sun, will soon come back to Rama himself, after slaying the demon king in battle.

ALL— Ah, Ravana is hit down!

THE FIRST— Seeing Ravana hit down, a shower of flowers has poured down; and these drums of gods are roaring loudly.

THE SECOND—Well, the task of the gods has been accomplished.

THE FIRST— Come along, then. We too shall greet Rama, the benefactor of all.

BOTH— Well, an excellent idea.                    
         * (Exeunt Omnes)*

END OF THE PRELUDE

(Then enter Rama)

RAMA— Very soon having slain Ravana who was pierced by my shafts in battle today, having also made the virtuous-minded Vibhisbana lord of Lanka now, and having thus swam with both my arms across the ocean of vows of no insignificant spirited deeds (roamings of sea creatures), I shall proceed together with my relatives, to Lanka in order to console Sita.

*(Entering)*LAKSHMANA—Victory to my brother! Brother, my noble sister-in-law is approaching you here.

RAMA— Dear Lakshmana,

 Because of (her) misfortune anger checks my courage now from beholding Vaidehi who has dwelt in the house of an enemy.

LAKSHMANA— As my brother commands.                  
           * (Exit)*

*(Entering)*VIBHISHANA—Victory my lord!

 Here has come by your favour, O king! that faithful wife of yours, whose misery has been removed by the valour of your arms, like the goddess Lakshmi formerly released from the demon house by your favour.

RAMA—Vibhishana, let her stay there alone; sullied by the contact of the demon, she has become a stigma on the Ikshvaku family. O Lord of Lanka, with due regard to king Dasaratha, my father, it is not proper that she should see me. Moreover,—

 O king! one who prevents a person from sinking in unworthy objects of the senses is a friend; contary to this, he is a foe.

VIBHISHANA—May it please you, my lord!

RAMA— You shall not trouble me any further.

*(Entering)*LAKSHMANA—Victory to my brother! Just after hearing your intention, sister-in-law awaits your permission to enter fire.

RAMA— Lakshmana, act as per the wish of her, who is devoted to her husband.

LAKSHMANA—As my brother bids.                     
         *(Walking along)*

 O alas! knowing the chastity of the queen and also hearing my brother's command, my mind, placed betwixt duty and affection, swings.

 Hello, who is there?

*(Entering)*HANUMAN—Victory to the prince!

LAKSHMANA—Hanuman, if you are able (tell me what to do ;) thus orders my brother.

HANUMAN —What do you (O prince!) consider in this?

LAKSHMANA— My consideratin is in vain. Or, we are only to carry out the intention of my noble brother. We shall go, now.

HANUMAN—As the prince bids.                     
            *(Exeunt ambo)*

*(Entering)* LAKSHMANA—May it please you, brother! Brother, a very great wonder! My noble sister-in-law. here,

 Resembling almost a garland of full blown lotuses, rendering all your efforts purposeless and abandoning all hopes of life, enters swiftly into fire here, just as a female swan enters into a lotus grove.

RAMA— Realy a great wonder! Laksmana, prevent, prevent (her).

LAKSHMANA— As my brother bids.

*(Entering)* HANUMAN—Hail, my lord!

 This pure lady, like a gold necklace, having gained contact with the purifying fire, unaffected has come out with lustre added by the flames.

RAMA— *(Astonished*) What, what?

LAKSHMANA—Oh, wonder !

*(Entering)*SUGRIVA—Victory, my lord?

 Who indeed, is this of respectable form that has sprung out of the blazing fire, bearing Janaka's daughter alive?

LAKSHMANA—Ey, here is the divine Fire coming just this way, leading the worthy laby.

RAMA— O, this is the Fire god! We will go to meet him.

(All go near him. Then enter Fire bearing Sita)

FIRE— This is god Narayana, Victory, my lord!

RAMA— O God! I salute you.

FIRE—You, the lord of gods, should not salute me.

 O lord of kings and best of men! accept this sinless, unscathed and pure Janaki, who is respected by all the worlds.

 Further,

 Know this daughter of Janaka to be goddess Lakshmi; She has come to you, putting on a human body.

RAMA—Iam beholden to you.

 O smoke-bannered god! it was just to convince the people, that such a thing was done by me, although I knew quite well Vaidehi's purity.

(Behind the curtain Celestail Gandarvas sing)

 Salutations to God Narayana, cause of the three worlds! Brahma is your heart, O lord of the three worlds! Rudra is your wrath. The Moon and Sun are your two eyes; the Goddess of Speech is your tongue. O lord of the gods! the three worlds together with Brahma, Indra and the Maruth hosts were created only by you, O. lord! this Sita is She (Lakshmi) who is attached to her lotus dwelling; You are Vishnu. Please accept her.

(Once again, behind the curtain others sing)

 This earth which had sunk in water was raised only by You in the body of a Boar. O lord.of gods! these three worlds were encompassed by you with three strides. The gods were not e comforted before, so much by the slaying of Ravana in battle, as they have been now by you who are with your queen, putting on (human) forms of your own accord.

FIRE—Sweet-faced sir, these hosts of gods, godly sages, siddhas, vidyadharas, gandharvas and Apsarases congratulate you in accordance with their status.

RAMA—I am obliged (to them).

FIRE—Sweet-faced sir,—this way, this way for consecration, please.

RAMA— As you bid.                           
             *(Exeunt ambo)*

*(Behind the curtain)* Victory to the lord! Victory to our master! Victory to the sweet-faced one! Victory to the great king! Victory to the destroyer of Ravana! Victory to the long-lived one!

VIBHISHANA—Here is the great king!

 Having crossed the ocean of his vows in the fight, having regained today also the queen freed of sin, and having been consecrated by all the gods, he shines like the moon in a clear sky.

LAKSHMANA— Ah, the vishnuite lustre in my noble brother!

 Surrounded by hosts of gods such as Yama, Varuna, Kubera, and Indra, being consecrated on the words of Dasaratha, he shines like Indra when he gained lordship over the gods.

(Then enter Rama consecrated, with Sita)

RAMA— Dear Lakshmana,

 My father, after performing the auspicious cord *(Pratisara)* function, placed me on the throne but broke off the consecration with the desire of pleasing my mother (formerly); by the same father who went the way of fate clearly, but who is with a delighted heart to day; once again I have been blessed personally with the consecration, now.

FIRE—Sweet-faced sir, here are your subjects led by Bharata and Satrughna, come to you at the command of Mahendra.

RAMA— O god, I am extremely happy.

FIRE— These gods (*nectar-eaters)* such as Mahendra congratulate you.

RAMA—I am beholden to them.

FIRE—Sweet-faced sir, what further pleasing thing can I do for you?

RAMA—If your divinity is pleased with me, what further thing should I desire!

**(Epilogue)**

 May the kine be without foulness; may the realm of the foes be subdued; may our lion-like king govern the whole of this earth.    
                            *(Exeunt omnes)*

ACT I

अभिषेकनाटकम्—

The play is so named as it deals with the three *Abhishekas* of Sugriva, of Vibhishana and of Rama. नान्द्यन्तेततः & c—Note the repetition of the idea in अन्ते and ततः in this stage direction which occurs at the very outset in all Bhasa plays. The Sutradhara comes on the stage after the Nandiis over as a private function. नान्दी is derived from नन्द् to rejoice. of. नन्दन्ति काव्यानि कवीन्द्रवर्गः कुशीलवाः पारिषदाश्च सन्तः। यस्मादलं सज्जनसिन्धुहंसी तस्मादियं सा कथितेह नान्दी॥— नाट्यप्रदीपे। सूत्रधारः, Stage-manager; of. नाट्यस्य यदनुष्ठानं तत्सूत्रं स्यात्सबीजकम् रङ्गदैवतपूजाकृत् सूत्रधार इति स्मृतः॥ **Sl**. 9. गाधिपुत्रः = विश्वामित्रः Gadhi's son.

 \[This sloka is a benediction It refers to the several heroic deeds of Rama. Even before his marriage, Rama went to guard the sacrific of Visvamitra and killed the demoness Tataka and scared Maricha, who came to disturb the sacrifice.(Balakanda). During his exile in the forest, on the way to Panchavati, he killed a powerful Rakshasa named Viradha. While in Panchavati he slayed Khara, the half brother and one of the generals of Ravana, and Dushana, and another general, in a battle which came up after *Surpanakha* was defaced by Lakshmana. After Sita's abduction by Ravana, during their wanderings in the forest both Rama and Lakhmana were attacked by a headless demon called Kabandha whom they killed. This Kabandha was at first a heavenly being; but cursed by a sage, he became a demon and was very troublesome to many. So, Indra gave a blow on his head with his *Vajrayudha*, as a result of which, his head sank into his trunk. When he was killed by Rama, his curse ended and he advised Rama to form friendship with Sugriva who would help him in finding out Sita *(Aranya Kanda)*. The next heroic act of Rama *(Kishkindha Kanda)* is his slaying Valin for obliging Sugriva a *Sharanagata*, and not because of any personal offence by him. Valin was a mighty ape and by virtue of a boon, could not be slain by any one in a face to face fight. Knowing this, Rama slayed him by shooting an arrow at him, unseen. Even such a *Pracchanna- Vadha*, he did not hesitate to do, to do a good turn to his शरणागत. of. तरणिसुत-शरणागतिपरतन्त्रीकृतस्वातन्त्र्य in the रघुवीरगद्य; the note by Vedanta Desika in his अभयप्रदानसार ch III on “सूक्ष्मः परमदुर्ज्ञेयः सतां धर्मः प्लवङ्गम"; also the episode of सुमालिनिग्रह which is a पराङ्मुखवध in the Ramayana, Uttara, ch 8.Rama would never let down any one, even an enemy, if he was a शरणागत. That is how eyen Vibhishana was taken in by Rama, in spite of protests from Sugriva and others. Finally *(in the Yuddhakanda)* Rama kills the great demon-king Ravana in a terrific fight with him. The benedictory sloka recounts all the deeds of Rama. This play begins with the episode of the *Valivadha* and concludes with that of the *Ravanavadha*.\]

The cry was of Sugriva and was heard rolling on like the roaring soundof a thunder. एष खलु—the three विशेषणाऽ of रामस्य have their parallels in the three of सुग्रीव . दाराभि... कृतस्य = "expelled from his country for having had carnal contact with the wife (of his elder brother Valin)". But a parallel to this we do not see in Rama. Hence the meaning "expelled from the company of his wife" is to be adopted. .... परस्परोपकार.......... suggests a प्रतीकारसन्धि. of. कामन्दक. **sl.** 3. Formerly Indra had lost his position for a year, when Nahusha officiated. But, by his misbehaviour, Nahusha got cursed by a sage and fell down to the earth. Then Indra was to be reinstated. It is probably to this occasion that Bhasa refers here.

 Mention is made here of the characters coming upon the stage at the commencement of the actual play. This device is called प्रयोगातिशय. स्थापना is the name used by Bhasa for the prologues of his plays. These are marked for beingvery brief and for the absence of any mention of the names of either the poet or his patron.

————————

ACT II

 \[After the events of the previous Act, Sugriva sends his monkey chiefs in all directions to search for Sita and bring news of her. After a vain search for a month, all return except Angada and his party. Hanuman, a member of this party, has just gone to Lanka on the words of the eagle Sampathi and found Sita there. The dramatist wishes to relate these incidents by means of a conversation between two characters and then begin the Act proper. This conversation here forms an *Interlude (Misra Vishkambhaka*) as one of the characters (viz. Kakubha) speaks Sanskrit and the other (viz. Bilamukha) Prakrit. Kakubha is a soldie belonging to Angada's troop, while Bilamukha is a servant of Sugriva, ordered to find out the where-abouts of Angada and his troops, who have failed to return to Kishkindha within the prescribed period. Bilamukha chances to meet Kakubha on the sea-shore and learns from him that Hanuman has just leapt across the ocean to Lanka and that as such, their task is almost completed.

 The regular Act opens with the scene of the Asokavana where Sita is surrounded by demonesses. This is a very short scene which consists of a brief soliloquy of Sita. Next Hanuman is introduced as just entering Lanka. He moves through every part of Lanka in vain. Finally, surveying from the top of a palace, he notices the Asokavana. Then he enters the garden and finds Sita there.

 In Sanskit dramas, unity of time and place should strictly be adhered to in an Act. But in this play, as in the Pancha, Bhasa has deviated from this rule. Hanuman has been made to move through Lanka, which means that the scene of action has to change accordingly, Hanuman could have been brought to the Asokavana directly and then made to give out in a soliloquy, what he had done in Lanka till then. Such a procedure would have been in conformity with the rules of dramaturgy. Of course, scholars who feel that Bbasa is not an ancient writer may argue that the unity of place is maintained even here, in as much as all the action of this Act is in Lanka only.\]

At this stage, Bhasa cleverly takes Ravana away from the scene, lest further talk with Sita may lead to an undesirable turn of events. Ravana's death within a month after this is significant. This episode of Sita's cursing Ravana answers the reader's natural feel. ing that Sita must have cursed Ravana, one time or the other. cf. a similar situation in the Pratimu P. 300. lines 20 ff. v 19-20. () As in the Ramayana, here also Ravana meets Sita at night as evidenced by Hanuman's observation !'; but when Ravana leaves the Asokavana it is "10 nadikas full and the bathing time passing ". This should "10 nadikus after midnight" when the which is just the time for bathing. cf. for a similar passage. **Page 13**.20 therefore mean has set in 177 -Bhasa is very fond of this word and uses it in almost all his plays. ....cf. vi 23 cd. and Pratijna ii 7. **Page 14.** च मिव— words uttered not aloud.What Hanuman says to Sita, here, is not clear. /3. अकरुणाः repeated in Svapna.

adopts a course quite becoming of a hero.

**ACT III**

 \[After the incidents of the II Act, the Asokavana is almost destroyed by Hanuman. The audience are informed of this through the conversation between Sankukarna and the portress Vijaya, which would have formed a *misra vishkambhaka* but for the fact that Ravana's anxiety is to be represented by making him personally hurry up to Sankukarna, as he is informed only briefly by Vijaya of the happenings.\]

Strangely enough, Ravana appears on the stage, as soon as विजयाleaves to inform him of the happenings.

Brahma and other gods hurried thither to obtain his release, and gave Meghanada the title of Indrajit, conqueror of Indra, but the victor refused to release his prisoner unless he was promised immortality. Brahma refused to grant his extravagant demand, but he strenuously persisted, and achieved his object.

**ACT IV**

 \[Angada's troops and Hanuman have returned to Kishkindha, with news of Sita, There upon, Sugriva has ordered all his troops to be prepared to march against Ravana.

ACT V

 \[The battle between the two armies of Rama and Ravana has come up and most of the demon heroes are slain. Even Indrajit has gone to the front. Ravana persists in continuing the battle at all costs and is not prepared to restore Sita to Rama, On the other hand Ravana has ordered for faked models of the heads of Rama and Lakshmana. This is revealed by the conversation in Sanskrit between the demon chamberlain and Vidyujjihva, which forms a *Suddha Vishkambhaka*.\]

While experiencing the bad omens, Sita feels delighted at heart. This is to indicate that the above sad episode with Ravana is going to end with very happy news to Sita. sl. 4-5. Ravana fancies *Royal Fortune* deserting him and going to Rama. At first he tries to persude her to stop but feels that it is a cowardly act; so allows her to go, warning her in a'confident tone, that she will be seized once again by force. * Allusion*—Lanka was originally occupied by Kubera, but Ravana ousted him from it and made it his own capital. //17-22 effects of मन्मथ on रावण. **P. 32** /1 रावणक diminutive form of रावण.

He also foolishly expects that she can be persuaded for a widow re-marriage with him. But Sita cannot bear the sight of what appear to be the severed heads of her husband and लक्ष्मणand falls down unconscious. // 18-21 a good instance of पताकास्थान—a dramatic irony. See Avi. (p. 41) & Pratijna II. Here it is a *Verbal irony* consisting of the remarks of a charactor 'which the audience with their fuller knowledge of facts, can interpret in two ways while the speaker himself is quite unconscious of any secondary point in his words.' *Dramatic irony*, a very effective dramatic device, is of 4kinds viz, comic, trajic, verbal and the irony of situation.\] *I* 24. अतिपति...*cf*.p. 15 *I* 15. **P 33** sl. 11 clearly contradicts's statement in sl 8 above. sl 12 रावणvehemently questions the veracity of the demon reporting इन्द्रजित् s death. *I*7 *cf*. पञ्चरात्र (p. 281); बालचरित II (P 20*I*7) sl. 13 *cf*प्रतिमाii4. *I*20 Yama was afraid of approaching रावणwho now questions the former, as it were, whether he still continued to fear him. 25 नेपथ्ये&c. seeing that all thegreat warriors such as and कुम्भकर्ण and इन्द्रजित्are slain, the demon soldiers are fleeing away from the battle-field and their general is persuading them not to run away in a cowardly manner.**P. 34** sl. 16 heroism of रावण.*I*17 अनिष्टानि....

ACT VI

 \[Ravana goes to fight with Rama in the battle-field. A terrific fight comes up between them, which is described very vividly by three Vidyadharas in the prelude to this Act.\]

 **Sl**. 1 is a split verse. Bhasa is fond of using suchverses; *of*. प्रतिमाiii 1; पञ्चi 57. **sl** 2. Warfield compared to an ocean. **sl**. 3 d. वज्र—इन्द्रा's (thunder-bolt) weapon made of the bones of दधीच, by which he chopped the wings of the mountains. **sl**. 4 demons attack the monkey forces. **sl**. 5 is like vii, a split verse and graphically describes the fight. **sl**.16 रावण in fighting mood. उदयशिखरि— the mountain supposed to be at the eastern horizon, behind which the sun and moon appear to rise. **sl.**7 राम in his fighting pose. क्रौञ्च यथा &c. see note on i 24. **sl**. 8 the fight begins. **sl.**9-11 the fight between रामon foot and रावणin his chariot. **sl**. 12 राम in इन्द्र's chariot driven by मातलि. त्रिपुरवधाय—मय had built three cities of gold, silver and iron in the sky, air and earth for demons. At the request of the gods, शिवburnt down these cities with their inhabitants. **sl.**13-17 the fight. Note the metre suggestive of the manner of the fight. **sl.**18 Rejoicing in the heavens at रावण's death. **P. 39**प्रतिज्ञार्णव— the vow of promise to free the sages of their troubles from demons by slaying Ravana. *of*. आश्चर्यचूडामणिvii 11. **sl**. 20 क्षय— house. राम is reluctant to see सीता for two reasons– 1. long separation between himself and सीता; and 2. her stay in the house of his enemy. /10 note the implicit obedience of . **sl**. 22 gives राम's definition of a true friend. While विभीषण is trying to advocate the cause of सीता before राम, लक्ष्मण has informed सीता of राम's attitude and she has decided to throw herself into fire with राम's permission. / 22 प्रतिव्रतायाः.... This is ample to show that राम has no doubt of her purity; only the points mentioned in sl 20 prevent him from accepting her. **sl**. 23 धर्मस्नेहान्तरे.... *of*. p. 13 / 20 & प्रतिज्ञा ii 7. / 8 आश्चर्यमाश्वर्यम् *of.* आ. चूडामणि vii **sl**. 24 सीता enters into the pyre gladly. **sl**. 25 सीता's appearance after the अग्निप्रवेश. I 25 Rama salutes the Fire god who recognises राम as the great नारायणin P 41/1; but it is significant that he immediately addresses him राजेन्द्र and पुरुषोत्तम in **sl**. 27 just as वरुण did in p. 27 // 2-3 (iv). **sl**. 28 अग्नि reveals that सीता is goddess लक्ष्मी. of राघवत्वेऽभवत्सीता रुक्मिणी कृष्णजन्मनि। अन्येषु चायतारेषु विष्णोरेषानपायिनी॥**sl**. 29 रामा's explanation as to why he allowed सीता's अग्निप्रवेश. **sl.** 30-31. राम is clearly identified with नारायण. The गान is similar to that in the आश्चर्यचूडामणि **sl**. 32 प्रतिज्ञार्णव of. vi 19. **sl.** 33 of. आ.चूडामणिv13. **sl.** 34 The circumstances in which रामis consecrated on the seashore alone is very significant.
