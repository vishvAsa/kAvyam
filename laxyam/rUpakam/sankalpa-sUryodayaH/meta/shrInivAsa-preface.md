PREFACE 

I DEEM it my humble and devotional service rendered to the holy feet of Sri Venkaṭanātha-Vedāntades'ika, the great ācārya, philosopher and poet, by undertaking the pleasant work of editing his famous Vedantic drama called Saṁkalpasuryodaya for its publication in the Adyar Library Series. In this edition the text is accompanied by two very learned commentaries called Prabhāvilāsa by Ahobala and Prabhāvali by Nr̥siṁharaja. Though there are several editions of the drama hitherto printed and published they do not meet the needs of the public, by adding any reliable and useful commentaries. The commentary published in the Telugu edition of Conjeevaram O. L. Institute is mixed up with the portions of two different commentaries leading to a confusion regarding their authorship.+++(4)+++ This book is also out of print now. The commentary published in the Devanagari edition of the Pandit Series, Benares, is anonymous and breaks off in the 5th act. The Grantha edition of Kanchīpuram, contains only a running gloss and not a regular commentary. Thus systematic and reliable Commentaries on the drama are long-felt desiderata. There are about 6 commentaries on the work and none of them has till now been brought to light by a critical edition. The commentaries that are now available are: [[xxii]] 

1. Prabhāvilāsa by Ahobala of Atreya family.
2. Prabhāvali by Nṛsimharāja. 
3. Prabhāvali (anonymous). 
4. Vivaraṇa by Srinivasa of Kausika family. 
5. Vyākhyā by Srībhāṣya Nārāyaṇa of śrīvatsa family. 
6. Vyākhyā by Nārāyaṇa of śrīvatsa family (different from the above). 

Of these commentaries, No. 3 was published in the Pandit Series, Benares, for acts 1 to 5, and in the Conjeevaram Telugu edition for acts 6 to 10. Nos. 4 to 6 are available only in fragments. Therefore, the commentaries Nos. 1 and 2 are included in this publication.

It was Capt. G. Srinivasa Murti, the Hony. Director of the Adyar Library, who initiated the idea of bringing out the drama in this form and asked me to undertake the task of editing. I am grateful to him for giving me the opportunity to do the sacred service. I have dealt with in the accompanying Sanskirt Introduction (Upodghata), the chief incidents in the life and versatile equipment of the author of the drama. 

The following MSS. have been used for this edition. All of them except the last one of the commentaries, belong to the Adyar Library.

Sriman S. Vasudevachariar, B.A., L.T., and Pandit Mansalgaṭṭa Desikachariar were kind enough to place under my disposal, their copies of the Telugu edition of the work. They cannot be adequately thanked for their generous help. Pandit K.

Finally I can never forget the kindness of Capt. G. Srinivasa Murti (The Hony. Director) and Dr. C. Kunhan Raja (The Hony.
