### PREFACE. 
The Drama "Sankalpa Sūryodaya” and its author Sri Vedanta Desika need no elaborate preface to be introduced to the public, suffice it to say that "Virtue triumphs and Vice succumbs" is the moral of this allegorical Drama. 

In this Drama, the hero Viveka finds Jiva (embodied soul) God-forgotten and addicted only to worldly pleasures (Samsāra). To make confusion worse confounded, diverse untrue doctrines about the relationship between Soul and God cause no little embarassment to Jiva. A discourse between the Guru and the Disciple nicely establishes the hollowness of the systems of Hindu Philosophy other than the Visishtadvaita system. Viveka strains every nerve to wean Jiva from the influence of the baser emotions such as Passion, Anger, etc., which try to bind Jiva closely to Samsāra and Viveka eventually succeeds in achieving for Jiva salvation with the help of Vishnu-Bhakti and Sankalpa. 

This, in brief, is the plot of this play but its chiefpeculiarity lies in the fact that the diverse human attributes such as Wisdom, Good-sense, Application, Illusion, Cupidity, Anger, etc., are the Characters and they speak for themselves in flesh and blood. Each of these good and bad human attributes presents its case, sings, dances and delights the audience in its own way. In spite of the seemingly sarcastic and humorous utteranees of these Characters the main theme of the relationship of Soul to God is never lost sight of. We feel that the whole drama will amply repay perusal than an attempt to sketch here the plot. 

1. As for Sri Vedanta Desika, the lifesketch that follows this preface is an attempt, however modest and imperfect in its own way, to show what a versatile genius, great philosopher and thinker and what a personification of meekness brought to relief by high principles of devotion and tolerance to views that are not his own, Sri Desika was. 

2. It is a pity that such a great personage and his sublime teachings should be known only to the few in south India who are familiar only with the Grandha characters. This and nothing but this impelled us to undertake the edition of this [[3]] Immortal Drama in Devanagari and the thought that our brethren all over the world, who do not know Samskrit should not fail to participate in the great bliss resulting from a perusal of this Drama, further prompted us to attempt the English Translation. We make no secret that we are but novices in this highly responsible field but the feeling that we are doing a real service, however humble, to our brethren at large and our profound personal piety to the great Acharya whom Sri Vaishnavas, at any rate, regard as none but an Avatara, is our only apology for embarking on this heretofore-unattempted enterprise. 

1. For the benefit of our readers, we have given the numbers of the verses in the Translation just as in the original. We have also added notes where we felt the translation is not self-explanatory. 
2. Any suggestions for improvement will be very thankfully received. 
3. We feel we should not conclude this preface without expressing our great feeling of gratitude to Sriman Vidya Bhushana A. Gōvindāchārya Svāmin of Mysore but for whom this work would not have been a fait accompli. We also tender our heart-felt thanks to Brahma Sri Gurubhakta-sikhāmani T. K. Balasubrahmanya Iyer Sastra Prasāra Bhushana of the Sri Vani Vilas Press for the very valuable suggestions he has been kind enough to offer.

I now therefore bow to the Primeval Lord, the Donor of all treasures of wisdom, the Manifester of Supreme Essence, even in His different Incarnations such as the Fish etc., the Exsiccator of the ocean of ignorance, and the Destroyer of devotion to other deities.

and of 
true nature of Jivatman' that will appreciate the singular plot of this Drama, where, the good and bad aspects of Jiva personate their respective presiding deities, and constitute the diverse characters (consequent). 
1. This striking performance will appeal even to men worldly disposed, for as much as it aboundeth in, (the demonstration of) the emotion of Heroism, evidenced in the conquest of Māhāmōha3 by Vivêka,-in the emotion of Mercy by the attitude of the Lord, in the emotion of Peace by the attitude of the Jiva seeking for salvation. 
Words fail me to adequately convey the singular significance of this Drama. Countless are the conches in the ocean, but 
not one of them can be the Conch Pāncha-

Let those ordinary rubies of little lustre which deceive the simple world remain in the mansions of the rich; of what avail are these ?-think of this for a while; could any even among the oldest rubies stand comparison, with that ruby which illumineth the Mole Srivatsa Vishnu's breast and which acteth as a mirror to Sri Lakshini's sports ?

The matter to be mentioned presently 
is the rarer feature of this Drama :--- 
1. The name of the Conch worn as a Weapon in the 
hand of Vishņu.

The implied meaning of verse (10) is :— Wordly dramas seduce the minds of simpletons who cannot discriminate the main essentials of a scientific drama, but this is a rare drama (spiritual) which baffles all comparison with other dramas. 
Such as the Syamantaka-a ruby for which Lord Krishna fought hard with Jāmbavān, Srí Rāma's Bear-Chieftain. For fuller particulars, read Syamantaka-Upākhyāna, Canto X, Sri Bhagavata.

The plot of this Drama is so arranged as to discriminate the good from the bad. It is wrought by a a playwright of high altruistic temperament, whose mastery of the Upanishads is well renowned, the special object set in view being the salvation of mankind. 
Nati. My Lord! Whose opus is this Drama ? This audience doth evince sympathy for us, begot by its sense of high veneration held for this self-same dramaturgist! 
Sutradhara. My Love! 
My Love! Didst thou not hear 
this :-

Sarasvati,—the Treasure-house of infinite virtues, and himself the son of PundarikākshaSōmayōji,—Venkatanātha, the acquirer of the additional name of Vêdāntāchārya through the divine commands of Lord Ranganatha,—the wearer of the renowned 
I. A large number of Advaiti Pandits from the North of India hailed once to Srirangam and challenged 
the 
Vaishyava savants there that they must either conquer them in controversy or embrace their creed. In fear and anxiety the Vaishyavas of Srirangam sent word to Venkatanatha at Kānchi (Conjeevarani), who, responding, came all the way to Srirangam and in Lord Ranganatha's temple defeated the Advaitins, after seven days' disputation. A full report of this disputation is collected and shaped into a book called Şatadūshani. Lord Ranganatha, immensely pleased at the great abilities of our Venkatanātha addressed him thus:- 
Well are 
we pleased that thou hast put down thy opponents and established the Ramanuja-Siddhanta which alone describes our nature truly. From now thou shalt be known in the world by our own title "Sri Vedantacharya." (See Biographical sketch.)

1.  If the Muse, worthy of the galaxy of the sages, Manu, Vyasa and Vālmiki, fragrant with ambrosia, desireth herself to grace a person, who could stay her? Will any stop the Ganga which falleth on the matted hair of Siva, as arid as the Vindhya Mount, if she falleth, of her own accord, on a lame person? I shall now answer the second question.

The two questions are:-1. How could language used for philosophic researches be made to suit a dramatic production? 2. How could language used for vehement disputations with opponents fit in for a dramatic production?

¡Nati.--(With_joy). 
What my Lord sayeth 
is right, but how to 
account for the 
embodiment of the Emotion of Peace in this Drama when the Masters of the Histrionic Art maintain that there is no such thing as that emotion ? 
Sutradhara.-(contemptuously.) 
Lady! Them, then, I do not consider as connoisseurs of the Histrionic Art. 
1.  Methinks that they hold the opinion. that the Emotion of Peace could not be enacted, perhaps because of the difficulty to find in this world an audience to appreciate that emotion. 
Further :- 
1.  The Erotic Emotion pampereth the ways of the wicked; the Emotion of 
20 
Valour breedeth mutual contempt; the Emotion of Wonder bordereth on the grotesque; the other Emotions are paltry enough. But Peace alone then by elimination is the Emotion that allayeth the agony of the mind. 
Nati. This superior Emotion (Peace) is of the experience of great sages, such as, Sanaka, Sanandaua and others. Still how could this Emotion, the essence of which is Yoga which is attainable only by the control of the sense-group, he represented in a drama, fit alone to be witnessed by philistines?

Lord Ranga appeared before Prajapati in His Praṇavākāra-Vimāna and Prajapati was worshipping Him for several years in Satyalōka, when the latter presented Him to Ikshvāku, the progenitor of the race of Sri Rāma, through his son Manu. Sri Rama made a present of this, his family deity, Ranga to Vibhishana, who then set out for Lanka, with the desire of installing Lord Ranga there for his worship, but lo! when he reached the present isle of Srirangam between the two branches of the Kaveri, Ranga was SO enamoured of the shady groves and green verdure of the isle that he took His abode there and declined to accompany Vibhishana any further. Such is the sanctity of Srirangam, the place where this drama was first staged. (“Srîranga-Mahatmyam" will give fuller particulars.)

Kama. Very well, Vasanta! This is in our favor. This vile Vivêka is in every way vanquished almost, for, this great festival is begun in the regions bordering the Kāveri, before which the places of diversion in Svarga1 pale. 
1.  Here we see the Kaveri, which aboun-

Rati.-My Lord! This great festival lacketh its usual eclat, for, troubled is my mind at the thought that for some inexplicable reason the invincible and persevering Viveka is the enemy of our Lord Mahāmōla !

Kama.-Ah, timid lady! Enough of thy 
excessive doubts. Thou seemest to be deceived by the simple fools devoted to our enemies, and so dost not understand the greatness of thy own party. 
Look for a while on the victorious weapons known in all the worlds three, of thy beloved, the conqueror of the universe! 38. Is not my premier bow the matchless frame of damsels, whose slender waist doth not exceed my wrist-hold, whose constant beauty is the bow-string, and whose earreaching and daintily curved eyes are the beautiful shafts ? 
Further- 
1.  If the melodious names of the sweet prattling damsels be but heard, it driveth all demeanour to a distance; good-bye it biddeth to peace of mind; modesty, it doth destroy; dispassion, it doth exterminate; what else will it not do? 
Vasanta.--Surely, this is a proposition a fortiori. Even the casual mention or hearing of38 
a woman's name causeth mental distraction, 
1.  Let alone the fact that the thought of women and their glances, prattles, etc, in an admiring spirit, driveth dispassion away to a distance. The thought of them, even in a carping spirit, doth surely drive dispassion away. 
Besides- 
1.  The attempt to restrain the mind, full of passion and wandering in the various woodlands of the senses, purely by one's own effort', is as impossible as that of trying to bind the Airāvata2 with a lotus-fibre.

Rati. My Lord! Thy greatness is well known to me, but I am distressed, like the plantain (tree) shaken in a heavy gale, to think when and what may befall us, through the force of our ever-persevering, farsighted foe, strong to command and counsel alike, favored by God, and aided by several co-operators, such as Yama,2 Niyama, etc. Well known it is that the

Ah, thou simplteton and sweet prattler ! 
Where is the scope for wisdom in the presence of me-thy beloved, whose flower-shafts fixed on the humming bee bowstring, have the universe for their target, and who is ever confident of victory? 
By what means can salvation be 
(possibly) secured (while I am) ? Indeed the slenderness of thy waist is perhaps not evident in thy mind!

Yes, my love! That, I See! I See !! 
The heaviness of thy breasts hath (evidently) obsessed thy brain (or mind) as well, or, perhaps thou art no exception. to thoughtless talk, characteristic of charming women!

Look here! 
1.  Incited by me, Krodha' shall create infinite ignorance; this shall bring about failure of memory, which in turn shall obstruct the influence of intellect on Jiva; Jiva, bereft of intellect, shall fall into abysmal darkness and perish there. When it doth so matter, what shall stupid Vivêka do? 
Therefore Vivêka's ministers, Sama," Dama and others, shall never withstand the overwhelming might of our phalanx. By himself, invincible is Mahāmōha, whose left foot is planted on the diadems of all Dōvas and Asuras. A hyena is no equal to the Lion, the lord of beasts !

On seeing Urvași (¿.e., born of thigh), the nymphs went away, seeing their efforts fell fruitless against Nārāyaṇa. 
43 
I have one thing more to ask of thee, not 
known to me yet. 
Kama. What is that? 
Rati.--What is the cause of the enmity, as 
between the lion and the 
elephant, 
between Viveka and his party on the one side, and Mahāmōha and his party on the other? 
Kama. Love mine! Thou shalt hear about this 
from the very beginning. 
1. 
2.  The chaste lady named Buddhi' lived with Jiva, in the abode of Mulaprakriti." and was ever devoted to him. She brought forth three sets of progeny from the triquality-bounded Jiva, each at a time, with a quality preponderating. The first of these is the set, Vivêka and his bandthe haters of worldly enjoyments, the second and third set is the joint family of Raga and Moha' combined. 
Intellect 2. The root cause of nature composed and Tomas 
of the attributes, Satva, Kajas 
(Goodness, Passion and Inertia.) 
1. Attachment. 4. Illusion. 
44 
In this triple family, Vivêka and Mahāmōha were respectively installed, as suzerain lords, by subjects akin to them in disposition. 
1.  Of these, the wedded wife of Moha is Durmati, with an eye ever adverse to Mōksha, and the devoted wife of Vivêka is Sumati, with an eye ever adverse to sense-lusts. 
2 
Rati. And then? 
Kama. Like the clan of Rakshasas co-operating with Asuras, Rāga and others, having passion, as their dominant trait fulfil the function of ministers to Mahāmōha, born. of the race of Tamas and the Lord Paramount of Samsara. The race of Vivêka, born of Satva, lacketh a large following and claimeth but few votaries in the world. Our progenitor Jiva, though by nature neutral, is now, through the influence of his wedded wife Buddhi, just at this moment inclined towards us, and this, the

45 
ever wicked Viveka and his band brook not. Like the man of polemies defeating his own argument, not realising its weakness, these, unmindful of their own ruin, long to deprive Jiva of his temporal joys, along with us, who desire to advance those joys. They impute iniquities to Prakriti so long enjoyed by our progenitor Jiva and have so far, by some unknown means, succeeded in creating in him an aversion for the same, and they attempt to makehim embark on a long never-to-return journey'. In this, Viveka and his brood illustrate the action of the most wicked Sugriva and Vibhîshana, the respective lords of the Monkey and Rakshasa races who deserted" their own kith and kin. Difficult it is to describe the state of Jiva, 
Archirādimārga. 
1. The allusion here is to Sugriva deserting his brother Välin, and Vibhishana his brother Ravaya, the two joining the side of Sri Rama and thus bringing about the destruction of their brothers. For fuller particulars, vide RamāyaṇaKishkindha, and Yuddha, Kandas.

Therefore it is that we desire to exterminate them, rupturing all fraternity. We oppose them with the aid of Pravritti' Dharma, and they oppose us with the aid of Nivritti Dharma. Their clan, having Satva for its essence, shall soon be overpowered by ours, like the glow-worm by the sun's rays.

Even for parley, peace is impossible with our enemies-the votaries of Nārāyana, and us-the votaries of Artha and Kāma. Even if, perchance, peace be brought about by some effort extraordinary, our King Mahamōha, expert in destroying all enemies, shall brook it not. Myself, a matchless warrior, shall never subscribe to it. (The keenest hunger of) a tiger shall never (drive it to) feed on grass.

Kama. If so, hear me speak. There is NivrittiDharma promoted by several perverse doctrines, disavowal of selfness in Karmas etc, all propounded by Vivéka-the foremost of fools, and practised by some austere philosophers plodding in the barren field of Upanishads and longing to exterminate our race by witchery. It is said that when Jiva is thus intent on NivrittiDharma, great mishaps befall him such as blindness, deafness, impotence, lameness, dumbness etc, in (the event of) discerning the fault of others. By way of revenge that selfsame Fiend of Nivritti-Dharma is going to prevail on Jiva to bring about a re-union with Buddhi. Therefore, out

But this sinful (brood) Vivêka and others, jealous of the joy of our race, play at games that tend to extinguish both the races, under the very nose of Jiva; blunt indeed are they of their wits as not to perceive their own ruin thereby.

We also strive to bring about eternal bliss to Jiva after liberating him from all miseries and even then keep our race sapient under the influence of (Jiva's) Buddhî. 
Do not the Upanishads proclaim thus ?:-

being the case, how is it that thou speakest of Sri's Lord alone as the granter of Moksha ? 
King. Oh my sharp-witted love! just think how exceptional forsooth is the greatness of Madhu's Victor! 
1.  Firm faith in the Supreme as the Root of all Beings from Brahmā down to the worm, effecteth deliverance from Samsāra. But the numskull who, though aiming at Mōksha, payeth worship to the innumerable lower divinities, is like him who hopeth to quench his thirst by dew-drops!

Sumati.-Aryaputra! Ever doth the mind of the Devas and the sages waver as to the knowledge of the exact relationship between the soul and the Lord High. But thou fixest thy mind on Sri-Nārāyana alone. How? King.-Queen mine! This decision is dependent 
on the Upanishads, interpreted by (the key of) several Smritis, Purānas and Upabrihmanas. The harmony subsisting between the Vêdas, the Brahmanas and Nārāyana is well known. 
1.  The truth to be searched is Vishnu (ie., Nārāyana) alone. The authorities are the Vedas alone. The True-perceivers are the Sātvica Brāhmanas alone. Thus judged are that these three do constitute a harmonious group. What use then of the other (lesser) deities who are but worms* by comparison? 
2. Those which exegetise the matter briefly touched 
upon in the Srutis. 
1. Peace-preponderant. 
2. The sacredotal class entrusted with the Védas 
and their teaching and practising. 
1. In so far as their dependence on Srt Narayana 
is concerned.78 
Further:- 
1.  If a sage Vyāsa, the arranger of the Védas, after reconnoitering all sciences divine, and subjecting them to severe ratiocination, solemnly declared thrice in a council of sages by upraising his hands-the truth arrived at by him; with him then for our authority, which other than Sri Nārāyana can pose as the Great Truth' ? 
The saying of the great sages is to the effect-"the way by which the great ones. have gone 
is the best way." 
1.  Logic hath no finality; the Vedas are found 
found contentious; the authorities of the Rishis are mutually conflicting. Why mention other paltry utterances ? Thus is verity hidden, like hidden is treasure in a cave. The wise man there-

Parisara,'-the real perceiver of truth 
1. Once during boyhood Parāsara, learning that his father had been consumed by a Rakshasa incited by Visvamitra, wanted to perform a sacrifice to exterminate all the Rakshasas. Vasishta intervened and requested Parāsara to desist from his desire to kill other Rakshasas who were quite innocent in the matter of the death of his father and then Parāsara stopped his sacrifice. Hearing this glad tidings, sage Pulastya came to the scene and feeling glad that his descendants were saved from a tragical death, blessed our Parāsara with the boon that he alone would perceive the true God. Vasishṭa also blessed him that the boon of Pulastya should prove true. Parasara has himself mentioned this in Vishnupurana. ef प्रदिशतु भगवानशेषपुंसां हरिरपजन्मजरादिकां समृद्धिम् ॥ colophon of the Vishņu-purāņa.... -

that pertaineth to the Supreme God, who prayeth for Moksha's eternal bliss, to come to all mankind,-bliss exempt from all pangs of birth, dotage and death,-himself supporteth our view, and this is quite enough. 
Sumati.-Aryaputra? This statement of thine doth not admit of a further rejoinder. I beseech thee to present to Jíva, in a nut-shell, the quintessence of all the Vêdānta. He is in earnest to arrive at truth, but is now perplexed in Vedāntic searchings demanding several substantial supports. 
King.—Well conceived. I shall meet thy desire. 
1.  The Lord of Sri, whose Sankalpa is the main prop of the three kinds of conscients and non-conscients' and who is the only Prime Origin of the four Purushārthas2, is the only resting place of all the cluster of the Srutis as the ocean is

My love! That which cleareth the doubts of even dullards hath now been briefly stated. 
1.  But in this Kali-age, some perverts, under the tight cloak of VedaVāda3 only seem to combat the apostates like Saugata," by insincere language like that passed between brothers-in-law. Pity! 
But these have been refuted threadbare by the best expounders of Vedanta.

King. Enough of thy doubts! 
1.  Sruti, followed by the several Smritis, such as that of Manu, etc, unquestionably accepted as authorities by eminent men,. countenanceth not, even in dream, the Smritis of Kapila, etc, involving selfcontradiction, but that Sruti, the authority per se, well fortified too by steady logic, deafeneth the uproar of sophistry

Hallo! but how then is it that the sky reverberateth with loud uproar, like the roar of clouds at the time of the great Cataclysm ?

She there sits, heart full of joy, and I shall speed to Gangā as smiling with her freshes as Sarasvati, the swan in the lotus-face of the Lotus-born2.

When will the clear fair Mandākini," with banks on either side of its stream, fragrant with the odours of jasmine that creep up the Kalpaka-trees flourishing amidst cool ponds between, (when will this Mandakini,) alas! wear away the sorrows which, by (souls) violently whirled in samsāric wheel,' are hard to bear?

1. In the self-same place-- 
The wind-tossed trees shower from 
their branch-tops flowers prodigally redolent,-flowers fit to deck the fillets circling the locks of the ladies of Mahêndra's court, reposing in the shade,—flowers reminding the shafts of the great archer. Kama, the betrayer of the coyness of women. Sraddha. Be it as it pleaseth thee, my friend ! 
(Both sit down with ease.) 
Sraddha.-Lo! Vicharanā! What brought thee 
to this place ? 
89 
Vicharana. My beloved friend! Hear me. 
Some apostates and agnostics, clever in establishing the doctrine of Buddha and Jina, have now been ordered by king Mahāmōha-irate at hearing the preparations of king Vivêka, assisted by his chief Vyavasaya,to perturb Jiva whose mind is now firmly fixed on Purushottama's (Vishnu's) lotus-feet, by diverting it to some other object, just like a tiller leaving his plough and running after a jackal. The rumour that these atheists surround the Jiva hath reached Sumati, our queen, who hath asked me to convey this news confidentially to the chief Vyavasaya, who is now closetted with the great king Viveka. I have now set 
out to see this Vyavasaya. 
Sraddha.—That the Perverts have joined hands with Mahāmōha in his enterprise is just like the asses' song in the ghost's marriage. But mind not. It is no difficult task at all 
1. Industry or Effort. 2. हालिकजम्बुकदर्शनन्याय 
90 
for our great king to overthrow the doctrines 
of our opponents. 
Vicharana.—Hallo! Sraddhā! 
How thinkest 
thou that the doctrines of several able apostates, pursuing the creed of Brihaspati1 and others, could be subverted by a single person? 
" 
Sraddha. Thou shalt realise the truth of what I say, on the basis of the popular dictum 
that truth alone endureth and untruth betrayeth itself in time. 
1. Quick can Viveka overthrow the creeds of all Heretics like the rising Sun driving darkness dense, like the raging wild fire devouring the forest dry, the forest of the Vindhya range,-like the mighty hurricane blowing off cotton mountains high. 
2. The School of Philosophy founded by Brihaspati

the main doctrine of which is :Enjoy whilst thou livest, for it is but blank after death." 
"Eat and live to-day, let to-morrow take care of 
itself." &c. See Paramata-bhanga by Deșika. 
91 
Therefore the attempt of Mahāmōha in collecting a host of Perverts to conquer Vivêka is no better than that 
of a stone-raft sought out for crossing the high seas. 
Vicharana. Dear friend! Thy words have swift imparted courage to me, and my mis-givings have given way. I shall see my lady 
after speedily executing her commands. 
Sraddha.—Hallo! Vichārana! Thy level-headedness, and friendship as well, have been demonstrated. I will now gather lotus blossoms, and thou wilt betake to the royal castle. 
Interlude ends.

(Brooding for a while and sighing.) 
1. In this perfect world, teeming mostly with ignoramuses, God's displeasure compelleth crafty men being born, to range themselves in hostile camps, to devise doctrines diverse, and by their inculcation to provoke wranglings many. In no way do these differ from the ravings of mengone daft. 
Alas! How shall true Vêdānta thrive in this world pestered by (such) doctrines distractingly diverse, causing confusion worse confounded? 
(Looking at the sky.) 
Ah, thou vile Mahāmōha! By rendering the worlds three bewildered what hath been or what will be thy gain? 
1. Where drugs life-giving have become scarce, noxious ones beteem the sea-girt earth. 
To remove this pain, I shall resort to the Lord Almighty.

1. I adore the causeless and stainless splendour of Hayagriva, present as a pure mount crystal-made, depriving the agonies. of the worlds three by His dazzle, nectarlike,-Hayagriva whose neighing voice resembleth the Upanishads Eternal. 
2. Further, may the neigh of Hayagrîvathe sum and sense and seat of Vedas, Sāma, Rig and Yajur,-of all obstacles the Remover, the surging swell of the sea of selfknowledge-efface my inner ignorance, caused by the clamour of heretics, conceited, combative and carrying a roaring trade (of theirs.)

cordially appealing to the assembly, the vile Saugatas have fled in every direction, but Madhyamika alonethe leader of the van of the Bauddhas-disregardeth the accusation with temerity, parading his pedantry. He must in particular be uprooted for his bombasts thus: 
1.  Let the Vaibhāshika's oration enjoy peace; to the Santrantikas, well-wishings; let the Yogāchāras leave their means of proof; let alone the adherents of Sankara &c. who only follow them (Yogacharas). But here emergeth this Madhyamika, bursting with his ability to make and unmake theories of non-entity, the upholder of the monistic doctrine of negation, hard to 
persist, the momentary doctrine must bo 
abandoned.

King.--Arya! This disputatious Paudit-churl, the scholastic of 'total illusion' and advocate of negation,' should himself be relegated to negation'. 
Guru.-Lad! Ponder over this matter deliberately. 
Pupil.--Why such deep deliberation? He argueth for himself eternal silence, by reckless arguments, akin to those, a son would employ for the barrenness of his mother. 
Further:- 
1.  This wrangler (Madhyamika") standeth 
2. Anything that is unreal cannot be perceived or known by the sense, just as a man cannot say that his mother is a barren woman, for the very idea of barrenness connotes the fact of being sonless. Similarly the very idea of percoption or knowledge implies the existence of a real object. To say that unreality alone is real is a contradiction of words.

self-condemned, inasmuchas his Own wit is unwitted by the arrows of his own self-contradicting arguments, opposing each other, and breaking down. There seemeth no occasion therefore to advance any more (on our part), for as much as that would be to club-heat one already beaten. 
(Behind the curtain), (1 ery):— 
Devils! Devils!! 
Senapati.--Not so, not so. These are Digambaras with the mingled1 (feelings of) joy and sorrow at the overthrow of the Saugata creed, and vetoers of the evidences of Perception and Inference. So do they dupe others.

Pupil.--(Smiling.) 
1.  Rules of eating proper and improper (food) and canons of logic for defence of Own, and accusation of other's, doctrines, they have abjured; and they know not their own defeat. As for punishment, the gods themselves,―angered by their denunciation of the Vedas-have inflicted punishment in the shape of (their resorting to the habit of painfully) pulling the hairs of the head'. 
Further punishment dependeth 
thy majesty and the Guru. 
King-Ah general l To sight them paineth. 
May they pass beyond my vision! 
Senapati.-Lord! Blinded by thy glory-sun, they, like owls, hide themselves in hill

and sea-side caverns, the abodes of the aborigines. 
King.-Who are these men again,-bearing un-vedic marks (on their persons) resembling the Kshapanakas (=Jains), engaged in severe austerities passing for eremites, and imitating the practices of the Pramatha-hosts'—who oppose the Vedas ? 
Guru.-Like stray-cattle stealing into the ricefields of Vêdie-Dharma, these must be 
driven to a distance, 
Pupil. They, themselves, will stay far off. 
For :- 
1.  Now that the turbulent professors of the doctrines of Kapila, Kānāda, Buddha, and the Hair-puller (Jina), have been befooled, these followers of the doctrines of Pasupati, designed by him to delude the offenders of Gautama, shall follow suite.

sages 
lasted for 12 years, sage Gautama's hermitage was the only rain-fed area. All other 
found resort here to shelter themselves from famine. For a long time, the refugees enjoyed the hospitality of Gautama and he would not permit them to depart. Thereupon one set of these guests who wanted to return to 
contrived a plan to get 
their own hermitages, out of the place by creating a false cow which devastated Gautama's crops. Gautama enraged, burnt the cow by his mere look and the guests left Gautama's bermitage on the pretext that they could not stay with a COWkiller. Gautama came to know the true state of affairs through his ¤ (eye of wisdom) 
and cursed them to be RET: thus:- 
त्रिपुण्डधारिणो यूयं भस्मोद्धूळनतत्पराः । 
भविष्यथ यीबाह्मा मिथ्याज्ञानप्रलापिनः ॥ 
Thus cursed, they invented a new faith called Pasupata-Tantra whose teachings are antagonistic to the Vedas.

1.  There loom the serried clouds. Cam they be the brush for eye-collyriuming? Can they be the (stage-) curtain before the Lightning-actresses? Can they be the Yamunā to the celestial Gangā', or are they the Tamāla grove fringing the shore of Ocean-sky, or are they the (dark) tresses of the Rain-damsels, 
Or 
again may they not be the (dark) muskmark (ou the forehead) of the East-maid?" Nay, are they not again like the flowing floods proud-bubbling from the ichor of the Cupid Elephant ? 
1. Ganga is white, and Yamuna is dark. Clouds 
being dark are said to be like Yamuna, 
1. Thus did the spectators of the magic clouds invented by the Pasupatas figure to themselves those clouds in various similies.

Further :-- 
1.  There issue from the bosom of these clouds, zephyrs-the offspring of winds, bearing the aroma of ambrosial honey freely flowing from the wildly-blossoming buds of Nipa-woods',-zephyrs so much relished by elephant-herds and wafting fragrance, fuming from rain-soaked earth.

this (illusion)?

Pupil. (Jeeringly). 
1. 
2.  
Devoid of all defects as the Vedantas are, how in this assembly, can these follow the headless trunk, the Pūrvamimāmsa' ? 
This indeed is the decision of the spiritual scientists, the vanguard of all the Vaidika-societies; viz., that Vishnuvotaries abstain, as from sin, from Kamya Dharmas, and deeply engage in Nitya" and Naimittikas.' Hence, savants (like. Bōdāyana) postulate that Karma and Brahma (or Jnāna) Mîmāmsas constitute together but one Science. 
Púrva and Uttara Mimāmsas, or the Karma and 
Jñana Kāndas, constitute one Science. Hence 
the former without the latter is a headless trunk 
and hence lifeless. Vedanta is therefore SrutiSiras or the Head of the Vedas. 
1. Duties performed with some motive or reward 
other than the attainment of beatitude.

King. (Pleased) Holy sire! 
By his exposition, faithful to teaching and congenial, hath thy disciple proved his creed of wisdom and disproved that of the others, as if firmly founding' a pillar, and hath thus relieved himself of all Vedanta-concerti. But wedded to the Vedic coat, and yet weaned not from alien ways, as these (Kumārilas etc.) are, what is the retort for them? 
· Guru.(Smiling.) 
1.  By cruel fate, have these missed the Vedic path; replete with ridicule are their utterances, their zest for them appealing only to their wives. How then can this earth brook their boast ? 
Pupil.-Great king! By the routing of the aliens (Bauddhas etc.) alone, have these (Kumārilas etc.) been uprooted.

Moreover:-

at once. 
Their disjunction with Jiva can be, by all means, effected, by casting the nets of making Svarga appear worthy and Mōksha unworthy, in all places. Expert as I am in a thousand and one deceits, I shall just beguile the beggarly Virakti, as Mārîcha

Rama was decoyed to a distance by Māricha, when Ravana enticed away Sita. (āranya-Kanda-Sri Rāmāyana.)

1. It is mistaken to aver that beatitude 
is Self-realisation; but if beatitude be one intercoursing with another, then what else but Kāma can best constitute what is called beatitude (Moksha), coveted by one and all? Beatitude therefore can be no other than Svarga, the seat of all (carnal) enjoyments at will, and this view is supported by the authority of our betters, the NirisvaraMîmāmsakas (Godless philosophers). 
Dvesha. Indeed! It is this that is accepted to be the final decision, arrived at after a careful study of the traditions of Mahāmōha, by savants well-versed in Mahāmōha's lore*.

of the swarm of birds from their nests in the hollow of a branch of a tree, burning with wild fire, surely this utterance of thine will drive Vishnu-bhakti to

Svarga and Naraka, waking, dreaming, sleeping, swooning and agony of death. 
Besides:

Jiva doth wander in this Samsara, made horrid by dotage, death, and fleeting sweet youth and by the manifold inter-related sins, flowing. like the Blood of the wild torrent, wherein the miraculously quick cosmic Creator seemeth to have distinguished the different Karmas by the force of his hurricane-Lîlā3.

1.  With his predisposition for a 80journ in Svarga, countered however by the frequent spectacle of the falls therefrom, the mind of Jiva doth engender in him an infinite thirst for the Para-Brahman'. Even if this thirst at times becometh languid by mental weakness, it is again revived and it firmly establisheth in Jiva a penchant for either Bhakti or Prapatti2 according to his personal aptitude. 
Further :- 
1.  Jiva, by sole decree of fortune, shall acquire an intense love for the ParaBrahman', engendered by the correct understanding of His Blessed Attributes, devoid of all defect, and shall know the natural difference in results, existing in the knowledge of the diverse Vidyas, the one as equally congenial as the other, like the different nectar-waves. 
Then, the Jiva, like the bee, shall enjoy the honey of Parama-purusha's' lotus-Feet 
1. Supreme Lord. 
2. Taking refuge on God.

and shall look upon even the Dêvacity as but a hell. 
1.  Here, the moment Jiva casteth away his attachment to Samsāra, on account of his recollection of his endless wanderings, an eager longing to attain the Supreme Brahman doth seize him through the knowledge of His singular attributes, and he then doth rightly indulge in the study of the several groups of sciences, relating to Godhead, pure, and devoid of all delusions and by discerning as to which of the manifold attributes of God are specifically dealt with and which not in any particular science (thereof). 
O 
I shall just dwell in brief on the 'methods of overcoming this illusion. 
1.  Moksha, reached through a knowledge of the different (God) Sciences' is either one or many. If they are one, existence of several sciences is not justified, 
the 
1. Nana Vidyas the varied ways of divine medi- 
tation which are 32 such as KENJA, etc. 
183 
as one of them alone may bring about Moksha. If they are many, there may be a durational difference etc., in their enjoyanent, like the difference attributed by the Mimāmsakās to the enjoyment of Svarga, and the existence of several (God) sciences is then justified. This fallacious argument-of the babblers who do not understand correctly the meanings of the Pramanas which re-iterate, that difference there is none, either in time or enjoyment in Mōksha, but only among the (God) sciences which treat of this end,-fails, through its lack of sense. 
In spite of this, those who err, will -ever err. For, even if the. crows are washed with thousands of water-pots, they shall never turn white. The virtnons will with no hesitation understand the truth propounded by those who apprehend the truth of God and who abjure the whole conclave of agnostics, and will attain Sarvêsyara.1

Viveka.--What sayest thou? The burden of 
the care of Jiva is now indeed practically lightened. For, his Virāgya," springing from his desire to vision Brahman, conduceth in a greater measure to help towards (God) sciences, than that Virāgya which springeth from the knowledge of the ills of Samsāra.

sciences, the Jiva performeth the Nitya' and Naimittika' duties for the sole pleasure of Para-Brahman, and delighted with the doing of these duties, he now hasteneth to fix his mind in Yoga, made blissful by currents of fresh nectar, flowing in the milky ocean of devotion, directed to the Divine Presence of the Para-Brahman-the Seat of all bliss.

the whole truth, how is it that thou dost indulge in doubts, like a witless woman? 
1.  A certain resolute person, who hath detached himself from Samsāra, renounceth all external sense-pleasures, as if it were honey-mixed poison, setteth his face against the finitely blissful Kaivalya,' and even in this world evinceth fitfully an intense longing for the enjoyment of the infinite and eternally blissful Brahman. 
It is but natural that a ripe fruit, which even an expert who hath climbed up the branch of a 
a tree cannot pluck, falleth before a way-farer-a result of the strength of mere matured merit, expecting no effort on his part.

Sumati.-Aryaputra! Proceed. 
1.  Renouncing the Lord's grace, which is as it were the cataclysmic-fire to the evergrowing infatuation of the mind and which swalloweth the oceans of sin, riding a bad horse of Karma, is as futile as the erection of a salt dam across the brackish ocean!

Sumati. Rightly so. I shall just ask thee who hast so thoroughly grasped the truth of truths one thing more. Why is not the realisation of Mōksha swiftly accomplished even by high-souled men with a thorough comprehension of the inmost truths of Upanishads, learnt at the hands of spotless Achāryas,-men who have uprooted opposite creeds, who have given up the tendency to indulge in Svargic, sojourn, who have set their hearts on the great bliss of the worship of Madhusudana's blessed feet,

unique heinousness of the sin of insulting the true realiser of Brahman, so ably elucidated by thee. 
Is there then no remedy for this sin? 
Viveka,-There is but one remedy and that is seeking the pardon of the one that was insulted.

Viveka. Queen! True. The ever-hostile obstacles to (God-) Yoga are indeed difficult to surmount. The attainment of Moksha will be unfettered only if these Yogaobstacles are prevented from appearing at all, instead of renouncing them after they actually occur.

Messenger.41. "If one doth fret at Krodha,

Sumati.—Aryaputra! If Jíva, who is ready to attain Móksha, is subdued by Kama, Kródha, Lóbha2, Mada", Matsara1, etc. incited by Mahāmóha, all thy efforts so far prove futile.

only for our good.

Kama. --Comrade! I shall act up to thy wishes. Jiva, whose meditation of the blessed Lord is but recent, could easily be turned away, by holding up before him the allurements of ephemeral pleasures, accustomed to which he has been all along. Is there not this Brahman for him, 
(for him, viz.,)—the fair-eyed damsels, themselves the end and aim of all ambition, visible indee"] to the eye of all Beings, the Dêvas, the Asuras, the Siddhas, the Gandharvas, the Vidyadharas," the Kinnaras, the Kimpurushas and the Mānushas-all ?

1. Why could not the damsels, who minister to the exquisite of pleasures aljo› who are the cause of the procreation of the universe, be called Brahman, in so far as they do possess the Brahman's attributes ? Vasanta. -Friend ! This, thine opinion, is borne out by chapter and verse in the Upanishads, for quoth they (Upanishads) that damsels alone are the Brahman. say that Brahman is a male is but complimentary twaddle.

1. Resolve not to give up Yoga.

Should, disregarding me, Vivêkaproud in the company of Vyavasaya' and others, would yet fight with me, he himself should bring about the fate of Saubhag captivated by a hundred damsels.

Even at the mere eight of thy weapons--the flowers-brought by me into existence and laid in reserve by hundreds in thy quiver-the trees' branches,--quiver indeed shall Vivéka. 
Kama. This sort of mild enthusiasm will not 
do in the matter of a mighty foe. 
For: 
1.  Doth not the sun rise with a full 
thousand rays to dispel the darkness which could (though) be dissipated even by a little light? 
1.  Set aside the story of fight; for have not the poets chronicled that indescribable misfortunes have attended persons who allowed themselves to be slighted, even 
216 
in a small measure, as in (stories of) gambling' and verbal debates2. 
Vasanta.—How is it that thou, though holding the whole universe under thy grip, underrate thy own greatness and anticipate the slightest slight from any person whatsoever ? 
A thousand locusts cannot screen the thousand-rayed sun! 
1.  So long as thy army is active, with its infantry-the charmning beauty of lovely women, its cavalry-their amorous gait, its elephant-division-delirium from draughts of wine, and its chariot-division-sexual enjoyment, who with any regard for Yoga can ever remain alive ? 
Now the Jiva hath not yet scaled up to the high pinnacle of Yoga. Such being the case, why for no reason doubtest thou that we shall not achieve our object! 
1. Vide the chronicle of Dharmaputra and Nala. 
2. 
15 
Sisupala. 
217 
For it is found :- 
1.  That the Jiva, aware as he is of the pit-falls of Samsara, doth still long for the same; though he speaketh of the attainment of Brahman, still he doth hanker after mundane prosperity; though he yearneth for the Ocean of Joy, he doth at the same time shamelessly shrink. Therefore the Yoga of the Jiva in such a dilemum, could with very little effort be frustrated. 
Kama. · Thou seemest to hint that the best opportunity to slay the Jiva is this, while asleep. 
1.  Most opportune therefore is this time for me to exhaust all (my) weapons on the Jiva who hath not yet completed his Yoga, 
-like Arjuna attacking 
attacking Karnā, when the latter felt abashed at seeing his chariot slightly sunk in earth! 
Vasanta. -Very well. If thou dost so, thy 
efforts shall sure with success be crowned. 
1. Vide Karna parva of Mahābhārata.218 
20: The person, who hath solely set his heart on tumbling into the mire of Yoga, that could not dry by ever So many sins, owing to Virakti's fraudulent ways, shall yet have all his Nirvêda' and conceit shaken out by the blows of thy weapons all and he shall again hanker after diverse delights, to which Rudra, etc, are addict. 
1.  
Breaths there the Yogi with soul so 
dead against desire who longeth not for the pretty prattle of women,-pretty-made by smiles,--halting accents and sensuous feastings, the prattle, serving as it were, for the triumphal flag of our victorious army, what by Malaya wind and the moon-light, what by jasmine and the hum of bees and such composed? 
Kama. ---Friend! A simpleton surely is Vivêka, inasmuchas he trieth to effect for the 
Jiva, who is such a victim to physical and mental infirmities, the success of Yoga. But it shall be as futile as crossing by swimming the high seas, as flitting 
1.

across the blue vault of heaven, as drinking at the mirage, and as taking a bath on earth. 
Further 
1.  Vivêka, intent on liberating the Jiva, and-who is rolling dissipate in revelry and delirious with draughts of sensedelights-knoweth not (it seems) the worth of the amorous sports of celestial courtesans, their charms resembling honey, dripping from nectar-soaked grapes. 
Just mark here the two horns of the 
dilemma :- 
1.  If, through the power of discrimination, a person, in whom the power of aversion (to worldly pleasures) hath just dawned, doth fret at me, how could, he possibly be said to have subdued Anger (Krōdha) ? If (however) on the other hand he casteth away anger, how could he be said to have shunned ine (Kāma)? Vain therefore is the twaddle of fools who speak of the subdual of (both) Anger and Desire!

(Walking round horridly and with a 
loud laugh). 
1.  How is it possible here to speak of Vivêka, when I-the Vanguard of several arch-chiefs, dancing on the horrid stage of war-am here, I, whose followers, the Asuras, raise feverish panic in the bosoms of Deva-damsels, whose (Devadamsels') sandal-paste, put on to cool heat, anon drieth up? 
Kama.-Welcome, my good friend Krōdha, the foremost among charioteers and ever ferocious towards my enemies! Thou hast come in right time intent on helping me, when I have been deeply deliberating

Vasanta. Surely this meeting of Kāma with 
thee (Krōdha) doth resemble the conjunction of wind with fire! With materials, all so ready, why should we tarry any further? Success surely followeth in the wake Methinks success will crown us, if we only adopt the plan (of nocturnal slaughter) advocated by our dear friend Kāma.

Virakti. 
Kama.Friend! The best of seasons, Vasanta, remindoth us opportunely of what we should do. With Kródha marching in front, heading the celestial-courtesanbattalions, I shall follow, with the string firmly braced to my how; and thou shalt follow at my heels, guarding the flanks, with all wistfulness, vigilant all round. 
(All march as described above) 
Vasanta.—Oh Kāma and Kródha-the foremost in Mahāmóha's army! Hear my advice. This is the occasion to despoil Yoga that is about to be begun, by nocturnal slaughter. 
For you riseth the moon lustrous, 
making the oceans four well. Behold - now in our front the rising moon-beansbarbingers, as it were, of the emerging moon-the lover of the blue-lotus tank and the servant of the moon-faced young damsels, marching in thy front.

着 
Vasanta. Terror of the enemy host thou art (sure)! Beware also of another matter. Even though one hath dissociated from society, self-esteem alone is enough to violate one's Yoga. It is for this self-same reason that Samvarta, Jada-bharuta, Vidura and others, rightly understanding the moral of Hiranyagarbha's text', courted public contumely, serving as sin-remover and led a life as if of madmen. Therefore before the Jiva might arrive at this state of contumely-courting, let Kródha seize him swift, using contumely itself as the medium.

The implication is that Jamadagni lost his life through Kartavirya, as he (the sage) became a victim to anger apparently through a snake and not through Anger (Krōdba) seizing him directly.

1.  For an Airāvata, which weareth the flowery-bunch-like Earth as its crest-jewel* 
2. Pot used by an ascetic for keeping water. 2. The Airavata is supposed to bear the Eastern quarter of the Earth on its head and the Earth supported on its head is compared to the wearing of flower bunches.

with no effort, can the carrying of 
the Lord of the Dêvas (Indra), the overthrowing of the Asura hosts, the shattering of the Kulāchala mountain, and the devastation of forests vast, be a cause of wonder? 
Kama. Friend Vasanta! Beware that what Krodha sayeth may not prove untrue. 
1.  Who dare resist the force of the darkness of Kródha, more powerful than sleep, swoon and death-agony, effacing all established distinctions of castes and ideas of high and low and resembling the dark billows of Yamuna, overflowing its banks, swelled by downpours of coveys of clouds (gathering) at the time of the great cataclysm?

(Approaching). Here is Lóbha, prostrating his elder brothers, Kāma and Kródha

Lobha.---Through thy grace, unfettered are my ways everywhere. Behold now the present unique condition of the world, ardently intent, like Duryodhana, on begetting weath, which is the second End of life.' 
1.  These kings of the earth, ever so firmly greedy for even a particle of a sod of this mean earthy earth, distract themselves; the lords of the immortals do ever tremble with fear, lest their position be coveted by anyone somewhere performing penance; even the ascetics who have renounced the world are not free from the weakness of censuring a person extolled by another. The whole universe is therefore under the influence of Durmati's maids Asúya' and Irshā.2

minister What obstacles shall there be for thee-the promoter of the Second End of life, so liked by all minds alike, owing to its susceptibility (as means) for enjoyment, the End, proclaimed in Arthasāstra,' that is so patronised by multitudes of kings, the end that is the Incarnation of wealth itself, so well co-operated by Trishna ? 
1.  The End of life named Wealth (Artha) patronised by the votaries of Kāmasāstra2 and begotten by means fair or foul, as may the tides of time determine, is entirely of thy making, what of

enemies' tumult. 
(Looking at Trishnā). Charmed looking Trishna! Fear not the foe, howsoever mighty, so long as thou art in the midst of

this great warrior-squadron. 
Trishna. So long as thou, esteemed by all the Dêvas and the Asuras, art alive, I am ever free from fear. 
Kama.-(Looking round with fear). Now we 
must retrace our steps. 
1.  For, Vivéka, with his natural strength of unfailing knowledge, with wondrous walk, well equipped with the firm armour of forbearance and contentment, appeareth before us, seated in the chariot of Pranana sent by Brahman, and he disperseth our squadron. 
(All fear). 
1.  If one of ye three,

Therefore, in this affair, we must first protect our lives. For, it is said that one must protect oneself by every means in his power. 
Kama.-Our Lōbha, who knoweth the ways of 
the world, giveth us advice most apt.

1.  It is not meet that we, who wanted to adopt the policy of night-slaughter till now, should fall into the great abysmal pit of angry Viveka. Now shall Mahamōha himself strive to defeat our foe in 
action, himself leading Dambha' with his wife Kuhana and Garval with his wife Asūyā etc. 
Therefore we shall now disperse in different directions, for, they say that to save oneself he should forego the world.

Dambha.--Halloo! Kuhanā! my dutiful wife ! I want thee. For, thou art my co-partner, by none unpolluted, as was Tārā' owned by Brihaspati, and Ahalyā2 owned by Gautama. Thou wouldst not brook even a moment's separation from me. 
1. Tarā, the wife of Brihaspati was seduced by Chandra, under the pretext of discipleship. The 
Drama of Tārā Sasānka is too well known to be 
reproduced here in extenso,

249 
Kubana. Thou, the best of Brāhnanās, hast expressed correctly. And yet I blush at the illustrations cited. Thou, my master, shouldst have said: "As Arundhati' owned 
by Vasishta." Whenever I am courted by thieves, gamblers, village headmen, royal ministers, heretics and such others, I resort to them, taking them, quotha, for thyself! 
Dambha. (Smiling). Therefore thou art the 
best of chaste women in all the worlds. My Agnihotra and other sacred fires, even if interrupted, are kept burning by theemy sacrificial wife, by fires, brought from some place or other, when my Gúrhapatya” fire is extinguished.

--Hush 
There is 
need for substitution, only when there happeneth interruption to Fire. In our home, interruption to Fire is a thing yet unheard of, for, our ever-pleased Lares et Penātes guard our Fires perpetually. Similarly, concealment of the periodical course shall be necessary, only if that monthly sickness ever appear at all. The same Lares et Penātes delay its happening, should it chance to appear during the parvas".

Always thou observest the Dvādasi" vow, after sumptuously feeding me, who is ever pinched by hunger and thirst, even on Harivāsara3 days, privately and well thou showest thine vow to others, by ostensibly wandering from door to door under the pretext of gathering materials therefor. I shall now however unfold thee a secret.

Queen Durmati hath, just now, requested me to practise some witchcraft on Vivêka, the desperado, who broodeth over some evil or other (to use) against our king Mahāmōha, the Lord paramount of all pleasures, both mundane and svargic. It is as follows :- 
Well, boy Dambha! Thou 
Thou who spoilest all the Dharmas of the universe shalt exterminate Viveka".

After conquering the whole surface of the earth, Parasurama, in all humility entreated me to accept the same as a present. I, treating the universe no better than a straw, rejected the offer. The Lords of the immortals, surprisingly gratified at my glory, desired to give me Svarga and Moksha, but rich in serenity, I rejected this offer as well. 
Kuhana. —(Musing). 
Never mind. Is the

sorcery, that thy distinguished self proposest to practise against Vivêka and in which thou requirest my co-operation, of the type of Syêna' or of any other kind? Dambha.---Ah! great Srōtriya's lawful wife ! 
I just tell thee the secret of secrets, known only to my most dutiful disciples. Tell this not even to thy companions, Trishnā and others. The proposed witchcraft is not specially prescribed like Syêna'. 
But :

(Aloud). Love mine! In any case, like the sun screened by the clouds, diverse religions, sown broadcast by me in all quarters are somewhat mystified by a few fools, the Upanishad-followers. Kāna and 
others, ashamed at the failure of their plot, prefer incognito now. I can, yet topsyturvy the prima facie argument as the conclusion and vice versa, creating difference in objects where it existeth not and sameness where it also existeth not and thus confuse this world; or, I shall strengthen the credible doctrine, so much in harmony with Ahamkāra etc, and pivoting round the cardinal doctrine, of

Experience, the doctrine, where the vain endeavour to establish an invisible Entity, is fully saved and where the end and aim of life are Artha and Kāma,~all by the sublimity of my arguments-and thus damp the vain enthusiasm of stupid Viveka.

Earth, Water, Fire and Air, are the elements; the admixture of these bringeth about knowledge on the analogy of Intoxication. Who is it that hath seen a soul/over and above this, and what happiness can there remain, the moment the body becometh extinct? This is the Charvaka doctrine, founded by Brihaspati! 
The Upanishads quoth that the faith acceptable to the largest number is the stronger faith. It is said that this is the Asura's Upanishat. 
Therefore the

Dormati.—Aryaputra! Before this paramount faith propounded by Brihaspati, what is Mukti, what is enjoyment and what is God? 
Mahamoha.-Just hearken. 
1.  The dissolution of body is Mukti ; superb sexual pleasure is enjoyment; and damsels giving this pleasure and adorned with youth are the gods. 
And so it is, my queen, who knoweth the truth of truths! These, thy questions, have been replied to in consonance with Experience. 
The grace of these visible gods is the one thing to be sought after, for conquering our foe in the person of Viveka.

The Vedantins state that, even those dear to the Supreme Lord on account of their aversion to sense-enjoyments refrain not from pleasures but indulge in diverse pleasures, eating, drinking, sporting with women, riding on carriages, etc, and this is the great virtue (of our faith). Indeed none would fly from the fear of the scorpion to the mouth of the dragon.
