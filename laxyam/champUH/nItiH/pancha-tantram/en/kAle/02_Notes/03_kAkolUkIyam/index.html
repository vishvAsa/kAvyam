A minister should say something (give advice) even though unasked under such circumstances: but when consulted he should quickly (without loss of time) say what is wholeso ne, whether it be agreeable or disagreeable, He, who, being asked, does not say what is benefi- cial and salutary in the end, he-a minister and a speaker of sweet things (at the same time) is said to be simply an enemy. What is meant is this-a minister, when consulted, should not simply seek to please his master by saying what is agreeable to him but guide him rightly. Read in the text after the fifth Sl.-go: go सततं प्रियवादिनः । अप्रियस्य च पथ्यस्य वक्ता श्रोता च दुर्लभः ॥ It is always easy, O king, to find men who speak sweetly; but it is difficult to find one who speaks or one who (without being irritated) listens to what is wholesome although disagreeable. Therefore, O king, let a consultation be held after retiring to a secluded place so that we shall find out the cause of his (enemy’s) action and effectively check him. अन्वयागत - heriditary. एवं स्थिते-matters standing thus; under such circumstances, o-striking at the proper time, seizing the proper opportunity to attack. worthy of being entered into an alliance with. बलीयसि &amp;c. - शत्रौ बलीयास सति तं प्रणमतां &amp;c.

Nit, IX, 50. That enemy, who is very truthful (lit. rich in truth), pious, noble, possessed of a multitude of relatives, power- ful and victorious in many battles, is fit to be made peace with. Cf. Kam. Nit. IX. 42. A friendly alliance should be formed even with a wicked person on knowing that there is danger to life, since when life is saved every thing else is also saved. For the first 1. see Kam. Nit. IX. 45. &amp;c.-He, who has been victorious in many battles, is, for that reason, fit to be made peace with. Enemies quickly fall into the power of him with whom the victor-of-many-battles forms a friendly alliance, owing to his prowess. see Kam. Nit, IX. 52, One should desire to form peace even with one’s equal, since victory in a battle is uncertain; no dangerous step should be taken (or, one should not risk his interest); so counsels Brhaspati. See Kam, Nit. IX, 59. Victory in a battle, in the case of men fighting in this world, is doubtful: therefore that (a battle) should be had recourse to when the other three remedies (1, and) have been tried (i. e. after they fail.) ga The Par. is irregular; it is, however, found in the Veda and in epie poetry. A man, who, blinded by pride, does not make peace (with another), causes, when forcibly struck even by his equal, the destruction of both, as does an unbaked earthen pot when struck by another. -v. 1. may mean-with whom self-respect is the chief consideration (91 m = ) or separate arra through pride.392 Const. &amp;c. The fight of a weak man with a powerful one leads to his destruc- tion; for the powerful man destroyed his enemy as does a (of earth ). stands unharmed having stone after breaking a jar Acquisition of territory, an ally and gold (money)- these three are the benefits to be derived from war: when not even one of these is to be gained one should not have recourse to it. See Kam, Nit. X. 28 where the second half is read as- i fago see Tan. I. 229 A lion, digging the hole of a mouse, filled with pieces of stone, gets his claws broken; or if he gets the fruit (of his labours, it is (simply) a mouse, Therefore, one should not occasion war nor should wage it under any circumstances in a case where there would be no substantial gain but simply fighting. assumes an One, desirious of unfailing (continued) wealth (royalty) should imitate the action (mode of behaviour) of the cane plant (which always yields and never unbending attitude) when attacked by a more powerful enemy, and never that of a serpent (which rises up suddenly and meets with destruction). See Kam. Nit. X. 32, 33. काले काले-Assuming the contraction of a tortoise (i. e a humble attitude) a talented man should even bear blows (inflicted by the enemy); and at times (i. e. when- ever he would get favourable opportunities) he should rise like a black serpent (i. e. at once wreak his vengeance ). See Kam. Nit, X, 35 where the reading is the proper time comes. This reading is better. when Seeing that war is imminent (about to break out) one should avert it by efficient means of peace, on account of the uncertainty of victory; one should not arms) recklessly. rise (in v. 1. One should give up rashness. 393 There is no precept to the effect that one should fight with a powerful person; a cloud never moves in a direction contrary to the wind. -a rule of political science. साममन्त्रं सन्धि० - counsel for conciliation leading to the conclusion of peace or calculated to bring about the cessa tion of hostilities. P. 137. न मम प्रतिभाति - does not appear advisable to me. सुश्लिष्ट - well-formed. See II. 30. अत्यन्तलुब्धः- exceedingly greedy, very avaricious, covetous. -Im- pious, unrighteous. One should not enter into an alliance with a man who is destitute of truthfulness and righteousness (or the principle of truthfulness ); for, although firmly allied, he, on account of his wickedness, will change beforelong. An enemy who is cruel, very avaricious, lazy, re- gardless of truth, blundering (in policy ), timid, un- steady, foolish and a despiser of warriors, can easily be rooted ont (extirpated ). संधानकी o mention of or proposal for peace. भूयो० &amp;c.-will be highly exasperated; or, will cause greater disturbance (cf. अन्तःकोप, प्रकृतिकोप &amp;c. ), In the case of an enemy manageable by (the use of) the fourth remedy (i. e. Danda or war) the proposal for peace is a wrong piece of policy; what wise man (physician) will sprinkle water over the body of a person (with the object of cooling him) attacked with fever which has not yet reached the stage of treatment and which is curable by inducing perspiration only. The verse is taken from S’is. II. 54. Talks about (negotiations for) peace, serve, on the contrary, to inflame an enemy already angry, as drops 5 394 of water falling all of a sudden on ghee which is very much boiled, (only) agitate it. -is no proper or adequate reason. The lion, taking his stand on his high spirit (his great strength) plants his foot (paw) on the head of an intoxicated elephant, though the latter is superior in bulk, See Kâm, Nît, XIII. 16. A small (weak) man, endowed with the power of energy, can kill even a big (or, physically strong) man, as a lion does an elephant :-so say the Bharadwajas. Cf. Kám. Nit. IX. 56. Those enemies who can not be killed by (sheer) force, should be killed by using deceit, as Bhima killed Kichaka by assuming the disguise of a woman. Enemies yield to the power of one whose punish- ment is very severe as ( people do to that of) the god of death who punishes cruelly (or who holds the fierce rod ); but they treat as straw him who puts up with every thing (is very mild). P. 138. 33. What is the good of his being vainly born, whose lustre (valour) does not overpower that of spirited men (or, his powerful enemies) and who is, (therefore, only) the destroyer of his mother’s youth. That wealth, which is not marked (lit. whose body is not smeared) with the saffron in the form of the blood of the enemies, does not bring pleasure to the mind of talented men, though covetable, What praise can belong to the life of that king whose territory is not copiously sprinkled with the blood of his enemies and with the water of the tears of their wives. काधिक:- superior in strength, निर्मयाद: one who has fan-one 395 transgressed the bounds of propriety or acted villainously. -marching away, flight. Neither peace nor war, nothing else than a march against or from, is considered advisable in dealing with one who is superior in strength, wicked and acting improper- ly (Hataria lit. not keeping within the bounds of propriety). Yána (marching off) is of two kinds:-one is for saving one’s life and wealth (treasure) when in peril (when there is danger from the enemy threatening the loss of both); the other is of the form of an expedition by one (a king) desirous of conquest (i, e. one is flight for safety; the other an expedition by a powerful king confident of success. ). यात्रा ० - यात्रा 8 march for attack लक्षणं distin- guishing mark यस्य and is nearly equivalent to यात्रारूपं of the form of. faufg-Noun in a formed from the desidera. tive base of f. 91 The expedition into an enemy’s territory by a con- queror, eminently powerful, is said to be very opportune (lit. commended) either in the month of Kârtika or Chaitra and in no other. कार्तिके - See Rag. IV. 14. मार्गशीर्ष and are also recommended as proper months for leading an expedition into an enemy’s territory. See Man. Smr. VII, 282, These months are recommended because they are the months of plenty and are free from the obstruction of rain. Besides there is no danger of corn-fields being devastated, (But) when the enemy is involved in a diffi- culty or has weak points, all times are spoken of (recom- mended) as fit for leading an attack. Cf. Man. Smṛ. VII. 183. Having well effected the protection of one’s own country by means of men who are brave, friendly (or trustworthy) and possessed of great strength one should 396 march against another’s country already occupied by one’s spies. -The attacking king should first know every particular about the enemy’s country by means of his spies. See Man, Smr. VII. 184. He, who attacks an enemy’s country without know- ing its roads or any thing about provisions (a), water and corn (i. e. without knowing how to procure these or make arrangments for these ), ( not only fails to conquer that country, but) does not even return to his own country (i. e. is vanquished by his enemy and des troyed). arar V. 1. provisions of various kinds. a ga &amp;c.-So it is advisable for you to effect a flight (the first kind of Yana ). P. 139. -read aa. Therefore, O lord, it is not at all (a) proper for you to adopt the second kind (of Yána i. e. to undertake an expedition ); you should neither enter into a war nor propose peace with that powerful and wicked enemy. -Wise men have recourse to object in view or looking to the cause adopt such a course. flight with some forcing them to The reason why a ram falls back (retreats) (when fighting) is that he should (be able to) strike (with great- er force ); the lion too contracts his body when wishing to leap (upon his prey) through great rage; with their motives concealed in their hearts and keeping their deliberations and movements secret, talented men put up with anything (f) disregarding it altogether ( i, e. waiting for an opportunity they suffer any insulte not caring for them). He, who, finding that his enemy is powerful, quits his country, lives and gets his kingdom again like Yudhishthira (the eldest of the Pândavas ). When Dharma lost his kingdom by gambling and was 397 asked to go into exile with his wife and brothers, he did so, knowing that his enemies were strong and his own party weak. He returned after living for twelve years in the forest and one year incognito, strengthened his party and wrested back his kingdom from the Kauravas. The weak man, who, through pride, fights with a more powerful enemy, does what is desired by him ( his enemy) and brings destruction upon his own family. flee &amp;c. &amp;c.-Therefore, now that you are assailed (pressed hard) by a powerful enemy, it is time for you to ff-do not appear to me to be advis- able. A maintaining one’s ground. fa:-especially. яf-commends itself to my judgment, having got into its own place. - च्युतः-driven or dislodged from, परिभूयते—is despised or overpowered. Attacked (besieged) by a powerful enemy a king should take shelter in a forest putting forth efforts: and stationed there he should call his friends to his help that he should effect his escape (or release). See Kâm, Nit. IV. 55. He, who, with his mind bewildered by fear on hear ing of the approach of an enemy, leaves his own place, will not enter it again. Like a serpent without fangs or an elephant with- out rut, a king, who is out of (leaves) his own place, is easily assailable by all creatures. -lit. approachable i. e. any one can go to him and insult him or attack him, org-Loc. for the Inst. It will be better to read rgft: 50. एकोपि शक्तानां शत्रूणां शतमपि योद्धुं सहेत् &amp;c. - Even one man……will be able to fight with even a hundred power- ful enemies &amp;c. P. 140. 51, 52, The two Slokas ought to be taken 398 together. They constitute what is called gri. e. two S’lokas forming one grammatical sentence. Cf. at युग्ममिति प्रोक्तं त्रिभिः श्लोकविशेषकम् । कलापकं चतुर्भिः स्यात्तदूर्ध्वं कुलकं स्मृतम् ॥ Therefore, having strengthened a fortress, furnishing it with brave warriors and provisions, surrounding it with a rampart and a ditch and embellishing it with machinery, and other things, one should wait in it, always bent on fighting: for if one lives (i. e. comes out victorious) one gets a kingdom, if one dies, one goes to heaven. Even weak men who live in one place are not over- powered (troubled) by even a strong man acting adversely as creepers growing together (lit. in one place) are not injured by even a strong wind blowing in a contrary direction. बलिना should also be taken with मरुता. साध्यन्ते v. 1. for a means brought under power; reduced to submission’. 54-56. Since even a large tree, strong and deep- rooted (well-imbedded in the earth) but growing singly can be uprooted by a strong (9) wind, but (a) the trees which grow in a mass and are firmly rooted are not uprooted even by a violent wind on account of their grow- ing in one place; so enemies consider a man who is single (unassisted) although possessed of valour, as capable of being vanquished and then they kill him, ga in S’l. 54 has no particular meaning; S’l. 55, should better have been omitted.

Fire, kindled in a place where there is no wind, is extinguished of itself. Fargo-who will free you from the difficulty or avert the calamity? -by mere speech even (much less by actual help ). The wind becomes the assistant (helper) of the fire that burns forests; but the same (wind) puts out a lamp: who has friendship for the lean (weak) ? v. 1 for at means ‘regard or respect for.&#34; एकान्तः- -an absolute rule; the only course of action. -living together; hence union.’ P. 141. 59. Just as a bamboo growing in a cluster thick and surrounded by other bamboos, cannot be cut down, so a king who has a number of assistants () cannot be destroyed though weak: See Kâm. Nit.

All that is made use of at the time proper for each, (as there is an occasion for or as circumstances arise for, the use of each). -double-dealing or duplicity; keeping apparently friendly relations with the enemy with a view to throw him off his guard and to destroy him. When an enemy is wicked and powerful one should deal with him distrustfully (cautiously) taking one’s stand on duplicity, now proposing peace, now fighting, &amp;c.-Therefore an enemy is easily extirpated by those who, themselves distrustful, secure his confidence and hold forth hopes (to him). Men well-versed in politics allow an enemy to grow strong once, though they have to uproot him: phlegmatic affection, when increased by means of molasses, is easily cured. एकभावः- एकः भावः feeling यस्य; acting with sameness of heart; hence honest, sincere. The man who acts honestly with women, an enemy, a treacherous friend and especially with harlots, does not live (i. e. he will be destroyed by them.) The duties towards gods, Bráhmaņas, one’s own self and one’s preceptor, should be performed with a devot- ed mind; the rest (other things) depends on (must be done with) duplicity (i. e. double dealing is necessary in other cases, honesty will not do). Oneness of action (sincerity) is always commend- able in the case of ascetics whose souls are purified (lit. imbued with the knowledge of the Supreme soul); but not in the case of men who are attached to women and especi ally of kings. 401 -by having recourse to cupidity (to be excit ed in the enemy.)

See below, He, who knows the Tirthas (i. e. the real character of the helping officials) on his own side and on those of his enemies, particularly by means of secret spies, will never come to grief (or find himself in difficulty or be reduced to a miserable plight). कतिसंख्यानि - what is their number. कति संख्या येषां. :-when they are known, An instance of Inst.

P. 143. 70. Let spies who know their duty make an entrance into, by means of the Tirthas ( officials that can be reached-flight of steps) and sound the bottom (the very secrets) of the large body of water in the form of the enemies. There is a play here on the wood which also means a flight of steps leading into the water.&#34; Just as one can reach the bottom of water by means &#34; 403 of a flight of steps so the spies can penetrate the very heart of the enemy through the officials and know his secret plans. प्राणान्तिकं - प्राणानामन्तः प्राणान्तः स सामीप्यमस्य which leads to the destruction of life, deadly. faf-a cock; at fa- रन्तीति विष्किराः gallinaceous birds. सोद्वेगं with dejection, sorrowfully. &amp;c.-does not care for us at all, does not think of us. 71. -read.

A talented man, though endowed with strength, should not turn another into his enemy: what wise man will needlessly swallow poison, thinking he has a doctor (to save his life)?

A wise man, even though powerful, should, look- ing for better times, reside even with a mean person, dis- agreeable on account of harsh (lit. thunderbolt-like) words; did not Bhims, possessed of extraordinary strength live, as a cook, in the house of the king of the Matsya coun- try, with his hands occupied in holding the laddle, dirtied with smoke and engaged in troublesome tasks? 203. A talented man, expecting better days to come, should do the deed he has in his mind, of whatever kind, whether difficult or good or censurable; did not Arjuna whose hands had become hard on account of his touching the thick and flashing string of his bow,, Gândiva, live, with his girdle shining in his sportive dances? -the name of the bow of Arjuna, which he had obtained from the god of fire when he assisted him in consuming the Khándavavana, See Mahábhá, I. 225 &amp;c. -Arj. so called because he could pull his bow with equal force with either of his hands. 204. A wise man, earnestly wishing for success, should conceal his own might, although endowed with calibre and energy, and should depend upon the workings of fate, Did not the Majestic son of Dharma (Dharms, the eldest 427 Pandava) suffer trouble for a long time in the house of Viràta, together with his brothers who were equal in valour to Indra, Kubera ( the lord of wealth) and Yama? (or although he had at his service his brothers &amp;c.) 205. The two sons of Mádrt, endowed with beauty and noble birth, and possessed of strength, became the servants of Viràta, being engaged as the keepers of cattle (and horses). P. 172. Did not Draupadi rub sandal in the house of the king of the Matsyas, being contemptuously addressed by the ladies in their pride as Sairandhrî ? even she, who, by her matchless beauty, by the qualities of youth, by birth in a noble family and by complexion, was like the goddess of wealth (Lakshmi), was reduced to a miserable condition according to the turn of adverse time (destiny). Slokas 202-6 refer to the residence of the Pandavas in the house of Viràta under different disguises. Thus Dharma lived as Kamka, Bhima as Ballava or cook, Arjuna as Brhannatà, Nakula as master of the horses, Sahadeva as a cowherd and Draupadi as Sairandhri, doing menial work.

A servant, who comes as a deserter from the enemy, disaffected and ready to join their company, should be set down as a spy from his having such duties to perform; he must always be discontented and corrupt, 428 209. Enemies strike at their foes whenever they observe them to be careless with regard to their sitting, or lying down, or marching or while engaged in taking drink or food. 209. Therefore, a wise man should, with every effort and diligently, save his own life, the abode of the collection of three (viz.Dharma, artha and Ka’ma); for if he is care- less he is destroyed, 210. Whom, eating unwholesome things (or, not observing regimen ), do diseases not afflict? (i, e. they afflict every one).

Rakshasa, the minister of the Nandas, wishing to restore the Nanda dynasty entered into an alliance with Malayaketu, the son of Parvataka, and planned an expedition against Kusumapura, the capital of Chandra- gupta. Chanakya, however, by his stratagems succeeded in making him an object of supicion to the prince who dismissed him from his service afterwards. 140.

For the first 1. see Kam. Nit. IX. 45. &amp;c.-He, who has been victorious in many battles, is, for that reason, fit to be made peace with. Enemies quickly fall into the power of him with whom the victor-of-many-battles forms a friendly alliance, owing to his prowess. see Kam. Nit, IX. 52, One should desire to form peace even with one’s equal, since victory in a battle is uncertain; no dangerous step should be taken (or, one should not risk his interest); so counsels Brhaspati. See Kam, Nit. IX, 59. Victory in a battle, in the case of men fighting in this world, is doubtful: therefore that (a battle) should be had recourse to when the other three remedies (1, and) have been tried (i. e. after they fail.) ga The Par. is irregular; it is, however, found in the Veda and in epie poetry. A man, who, blinded by pride, does not make peace (with another), causes, when forcibly struck even by his equal, the destruction of both, as does an unbaked earthen pot when struck by another. -v. 1. may mean-with whom self-respect is the chief consideration (91 m = ) or separate arra through pride.392 Const. &amp;c. The fight of a weak man with a powerful one leads to his destruc- tion; for the powerful man destroyed his enemy as does a (of earth ). stands unharmed having stone after breaking a jar Acquisition of territory, an ally and gold (money)- these three are the benefits to be derived from war: when not even one of these is to be gained one should not have recourse to it.

I. 229 A lion, digging the hole of a mouse, filled with pieces of stone, gets his claws broken; or if he gets the fruit (of his labours, it is (simply) a mouse, Therefore, one should not occasion war nor should wage it under any circumstances in a case where there would be no substantial gain but simply fighting. assumes an One, desirious of unfailing (continued) wealth (royalty) should imitate the action (mode of behaviour) of the cane plant (which always yields and never unbending attitude) when attacked by a more powerful enemy, and never that of a serpent (which rises up suddenly and meets with destruction).

One should not enter into an alliance with a man who is destitute of truthfulness and righteousness (or the principle of truthfulness ); for, although firmly allied, he, on account of his wickedness, will change beforelong.

The verse is taken from S’is. II. 54.

Those enemies who can not be killed by (sheer) force, should be killed by using deceit, as Bhima killed Kichaka by assuming the disguise of a woman. Enemies yield to the power of one whose punish- ment is very severe as ( people do to that of) the god of death who punishes cruelly (or who holds the fierce rod ); but they treat as straw him who puts up with every thing (is very mild).

What is the good of his being vainly born, whose lustre (valour) does not overpower that of spirited men (or, his powerful enemies) and who is, (therefore, only) the destroyer of his mother’s youth. That wealth, which is not marked (lit. whose body is not smeared) with the saffron in the form of the blood of the enemies, does not bring pleasure to the mind of talented men, though covetable, What praise can belong to the life of that king whose territory is not copiously sprinkled with the blood of his enemies and with the water of the tears of their wives. काधिक:- superior in strength, निर्मयाद: one who has fan-one 395 transgressed the bounds of propriety or acted villainously. -marching away, flight. Neither peace nor war, nothing else than a march against or from, is considered advisable in dealing with one who is superior in strength, wicked and acting improper- ly (Hataria lit. not keeping within the bounds of propriety). Yána (marching off) is of two kinds:-one is for saving one’s life and wealth (treasure) when in peril (when there is danger from the enemy threatening the loss of both); the other is of the form of an expedition by one (a king) desirous of conquest (i, e. one is flight for safety; the other an expedition by a powerful king confident of success. ). यात्रा ० - यात्रा 8 march for attack लक्षणं distin- guishing mark यस्य and is nearly equivalent to यात्रारूपं of the form of. faufg-Noun in a formed from the desidera. tive base of f. 91 The expedition into an enemy’s territory by a con- queror, eminently powerful, is said to be very opportune (lit. commended) either in the month of Kârtika or Chaitra and in no other. कार्तिके - See Rag.

Besides there is no danger of corn-fields being devastated, (But) when the enemy is involved in a diffi- culty or has weak points, all times are spoken of (recom- mended) as fit for leading an attack. Cf. Man. Smṛ. VII. 183. Having well effected the protection of one’s own country by means of men who are brave, friendly (or trustworthy) and possessed of great strength one should 396 march against another’s country already occupied by one’s spies. -The attacking king should first know every particular about the enemy’s country by means of his spies. See Man, Smr. VII. 184. He, who attacks an enemy’s country without know- ing its roads or any thing about provisions (a), water and corn (i. e. without knowing how to procure these or make arrangments for these ), ( not only fails to conquer that country, but) does not even return to his own country (i. e. is vanquished by his enemy and des troyed). arar V. 1. provisions of various kinds. a ga &amp;c.-So it is advisable for you to effect a flight (the first kind of Yana ).

He, who, finding that his enemy is powerful, quits his country, lives and gets his kingdom again like Yudhishthira (the eldest of the Pândavas ). When Dharma lost his kingdom by gambling and was 397 asked to go into exile with his wife and brothers, he did so, knowing that his enemies were strong and his own party weak. He returned after living for twelve years in the forest and one year incognito, strengthened his party and wrested back his kingdom from the Kauravas. The weak man, who, through pride, fights with a more powerful enemy, does what is desired by him ( his enemy) and brings destruction upon his own family. flee &amp;c. &amp;c.-Therefore, now that you are assailed (pressed hard) by a powerful enemy, it is time for you to ff-do not appear to me to be advis- able.

Attacked (besieged) by a powerful enemy a king should take shelter in a forest putting forth efforts: and stationed there he should call his friends to his help that he should effect his escape (or release). See Kâm, Nit. IV. 55. He, who, with his mind bewildered by fear on hear ing of the approach of an enemy, leaves his own place, will not enter it again.

Even weak men who live in one place are not over- powered (troubled) by even a strong man acting adversely as creepers growing together (lit. in one place) are not injured by even a strong wind blowing in a contrary direction. बलिना should also be taken with मरुता. साध्यन्ते v. 1. for a means brought under power; reduced to submission’. 54-56. Since even a large tree, strong and deep- rooted (well-imbedded in the earth) but growing singly can be uprooted by a strong (9) wind, but (a) the trees which grow in a mass and are firmly rooted are not uprooted even by a violent wind on account of their grow- ing in one place; so enemies consider a man who is single (unassisted) although possessed of valour, as capable of being vanquished and then they kill him, ga in S’l. 54 has no particular meaning; S’l. 55, should better have been omitted.

Men well-versed in politics allow an enemy to grow strong once, though they have to uproot him: phlegmatic affection, when increased by means of molasses, is easily cured. एकभावः- एकः भावः feeling यस्य; acting with sameness of heart; hence honest, sincere. The man who acts honestly with women, an enemy, a treacherous friend and especially with harlots, does not live (i. e. he will be destroyed by them.) The duties towards gods, Bráhmaņas, one’s own self and one’s preceptor, should be performed with a devot- ed mind; the rest (other things) depends on (must be done with) duplicity (i. e. double dealing is necessary in other cases, honesty will not do).

Even poison swallowed with the object of accom- plishing an end acts like nectar, in the case of all creatures: no hesitation should be made in such a case, 202. A wise man, even though powerful, should, look- ing for better times, reside even with a mean person, dis- agreeable on account of harsh (lit. thunderbolt-like) words; did not Bhims, possessed of extraordinary strength live, as a cook, in the house of the king of the Matsya coun- try, with his hands occupied in holding the laddle, dirtied with smoke and engaged in troublesome tasks? 203. A talented man, expecting better days to come, should do the deed he has in his mind, of whatever kind, whether difficult or good or censurable; did not Arjuna whose hands had become hard on account of his touching the thick and flashing string of his bow,, Gândiva, live, with his girdle shining in his sportive dances? -the name of the bow of Arjuna, which he had obtained from the god of fire when he assisted him in consuming the Khándavavana, See Mahábhá, I. 225 &amp;c. -Arj. so called because he could pull his bow with equal force with either of his hands. 204. A wise man, earnestly wishing for success, should conceal his own might, although endowed with calibre and energy, and should depend upon the workings of fate, Did not the Majestic son of Dharma (Dharms, the eldest 427 Pandava) suffer trouble for a long time in the house of Viràta, together with his brothers who were equal in valour to Indra, Kubera ( the lord of wealth) and Yama? (or although he had at his service his brothers &amp;c.) 205. The two sons of Mádrt, endowed with beauty and noble birth, and possessed of strength, became the servants of Viràta, being engaged as the keepers of cattle (and horses). P. 172. Did not Draupadi rub sandal in the house of the king of the Matsyas, being contemptuously addressed by the ladies in their pride as Sairandhrî ? even she, who, by her matchless beauty, by the qualities of youth, by birth in a noble family and by complexion, was like the goddess of wealth (Lakshmi), was reduced to a miserable condition according to the turn of adverse time (destiny). Slokas 202-6 refer to the residence of the Pandavas in the house of Viràta under different disguises. Thus Dharma lived as Kamka, Bhima as Ballava or cook, Arjuna as Brhannatà, Nakula as master of the horses, Sahadeva as a cowherd and Draupadi as Sairandhri, doing menial work.

A servant, who comes as a deserter from the enemy, disaffected and ready to join their company, should be set down as a spy from his having such duties to perform; he must always be discontented and corrupt, 428 209. Enemies strike at their foes whenever they observe them to be careless with regard to their sitting, or lying down, or marching or while engaged in taking drink or food. 209. Therefore, a wise man should, with every effort and diligently, save his own life, the abode of the collection of three (viz.Dharma, artha and Ka’ma); for if he is care- less he is destroyed, 210. Whom, eating unwholesome things (or, not observing regimen ), do diseases not afflict? (i, e. they afflict every one).

Rakshasa, the minister of the Nandas, wishing to restore the Nanda dynasty entered into an alliance with Malayaketu, the son of Parvataka, and planned an expedition against Kusumapura, the capital of Chandra- gupta. Chanakya, however, by his stratagems succeeded in making him an object of supicion to the prince who dismissed him from his service afterwards. 140.

I. 229 A lion, digging the hole of a mouse, filled with pieces of stone, gets his claws broken; or if he gets the fruit (of his labours, it is (simply) a mouse, Therefore, one should not occasion war nor should wage it under any circumstances in a case where there would be no substantial gain but simply fighting. assumes an One, desirious of unfailing (continued) wealth (royalty) should imitate the action (mode of behaviour) of the cane plant (which always yields and never unbending attitude) when attacked by a more powerful enemy, and never that of a serpent (which rises up suddenly and meets with destruction). See Kam. Nit. X. 32, 33. काले काले-Assuming the contraction of a tortoise (i. e a humble attitude) a talented man should even bear blows (inflicted by the enemy); and at times (i. e. when- ever he would get favourable opportunities) he should rise like a black serpent (i. e. at once wreak his vengeance ).

This reading is better. when Seeing that war is imminent (about to break out) one should avert it by efficient means of peace, on account of the uncertainty of victory; one should not arms) recklessly. rise (in v. 1.

One should not enter into an alliance with a man who is destitute of truthfulness and righteousness (or the principle of truthfulness ); for, although firmly allied, he, on account of his wickedness, will change beforelong. An enemy who is cruel, very avaricious, lazy, re- gardless of truth, blundering (in policy ), timid, un- steady, foolish and a despiser of warriors, can easily be rooted ont (extirpated ). संधानकी o mention of or proposal for peace. भूयो० &amp;c.-will be highly exasperated; or, will cause greater disturbance (cf. अन्तःकोप, प्रकृतिकोप &amp;c. ), In the case of an enemy manageable by (the use of) the fourth remedy (i. e. Danda or war) the proposal for peace is a wrong piece of policy; what wise man (physician) will sprinkle water over the body of a person (with the object of cooling him) attacked with fever which has not yet reached the stage of treatment and which is curable by inducing perspiration only. The verse is taken from S’is. II. 54. Talks about (negotiations for) peace, serve, on the contrary, to inflame an enemy already angry, as drops 5 394 of water falling all of a sudden on ghee which is very much boiled, (only) agitate it. -is no proper or adequate reason. The lion, taking his stand on his high spirit (his great strength) plants his foot (paw) on the head of an intoxicated elephant, though the latter is superior in bulk, See Kâm, Nît, XIII. 16. A small (weak) man, endowed with the power of energy, can kill even a big (or, physically strong) man, as a lion does an elephant :-so say the Bharadwajas. Cf. Kám. Nit. IX. 56. Those enemies who can not be killed by (sheer) force, should be killed by using deceit, as Bhima killed Kichaka by assuming the disguise of a woman. Enemies yield to the power of one whose punish- ment is very severe as ( people do to that of) the god of death who punishes cruelly (or who holds the fierce rod ); but they treat as straw him who puts up with every thing (is very mild). P. 138. 33. What is the good of his being vainly born, whose lustre (valour) does not overpower that of spirited men (or, his powerful enemies) and who is, (therefore, only) the destroyer of his mother’s youth. That wealth, which is not marked (lit. whose body is not smeared) with the saffron in the form of the blood of the enemies, does not bring pleasure to the mind of talented men, though covetable, What praise can belong to the life of that king whose territory is not copiously sprinkled with the blood of his enemies and with the water of the tears of their wives. काधिक:- superior in strength, निर्मयाद: one who has fan-one 395 transgressed the bounds of propriety or acted villainously. -marching away, flight. Neither peace nor war, nothing else than a march against or from, is considered advisable in dealing with one who is superior in strength, wicked and acting improper- ly (Hataria lit. not keeping within the bounds of propriety). Yána (marching off) is of two kinds:-one is for saving one’s life and wealth (treasure) when in peril (when there is danger from the enemy threatening the loss of both); the other is of the form of an expedition by one (a king) desirous of conquest (i, e. one is flight for safety; the other an expedition by a powerful king confident of success. ). यात्रा ० - यात्रा 8 march for attack लक्षणं distin- guishing mark यस्य and is nearly equivalent to यात्रारूपं of the form of. faufg-Noun in a formed from the desidera. tive base of f. 91 The expedition into an enemy’s territory by a con- queror, eminently powerful, is said to be very opportune (lit. commended) either in the month of Kârtika or Chaitra and in no other. कार्तिके - See Rag.

VII, 282, These months are recommended because they are the months of plenty and are free from the obstruction of rain. Besides there is no danger of corn-fields being devastated, (But) when the enemy is involved in a diffi- culty or has weak points, all times are spoken of (recom- mended) as fit for leading an attack. Cf. Man. Smṛ. VII. 183. Having well effected the protection of one’s own country by means of men who are brave, friendly (or trustworthy) and possessed of great strength one should 396 march against another’s country already occupied by one’s spies. -The attacking king should first know every particular about the enemy’s country by means of his spies. See Man, Smr. VII. 184. He, who attacks an enemy’s country without know- ing its roads or any thing about provisions (a), water and corn (i. e. without knowing how to procure these or make arrangments for these ), ( not only fails to conquer that country, but) does not even return to his own country (i. e. is vanquished by his enemy and des troyed). arar V. 1. provisions of various kinds. a ga &amp;c.-So it is advisable for you to effect a flight (the first kind of Yana ).

Therefore, O lord, it is not at all (a) proper for you to adopt the second kind (of Yána i. e. to undertake an expedition ); you should neither enter into a war nor propose peace with that powerful and wicked enemy. -Wise men have recourse to object in view or looking to the cause adopt such a course. flight with some forcing them to The reason why a ram falls back (retreats) (when fighting) is that he should (be able to) strike (with great- er force ); the lion too contracts his body when wishing to leap (upon his prey) through great rage; with their motives concealed in their hearts and keeping their deliberations and movements secret, talented men put up with anything (f) disregarding it altogether ( i, e. waiting for an opportunity they suffer any insulte not caring for them). He, who, finding that his enemy is powerful, quits his country, lives and gets his kingdom again like Yudhishthira (the eldest of the Pândavas ). When Dharma lost his kingdom by gambling and was 397 asked to go into exile with his wife and brothers, he did so, knowing that his enemies were strong and his own party weak. He returned after living for twelve years in the forest and one year incognito, strengthened his party and wrested back his kingdom from the Kauravas. The weak man, who, through pride, fights with a more powerful enemy, does what is desired by him ( his enemy) and brings destruction upon his own family. flee &amp;c. &amp;c.-Therefore, now that you are assailed (pressed hard) by a powerful enemy, it is time for you to ff-do not appear to me to be advis- able.

Attacked (besieged) by a powerful enemy a king should take shelter in a forest putting forth efforts: and stationed there he should call his friends to his help that he should effect his escape (or release). See Kâm, Nit. IV. 55. He, who, with his mind bewildered by fear on hear ing of the approach of an enemy, leaves his own place, will not enter it again. Like a serpent without fangs or an elephant with- out rut, a king, who is out of (leaves) his own place, is easily assailable by all creatures. -lit. approachable i. e. any one can go to him and insult him or attack him, org-Loc. for the Inst.

Cf. at युग्ममिति प्रोक्तं त्रिभिः श्लोकविशेषकम् । कलापकं चतुर्भिः स्यात्तदूर्ध्वं कुलकं स्मृतम् ॥ Therefore, having strengthened a fortress, furnishing it with brave warriors and provisions, surrounding it with a rampart and a ditch and embellishing it with machinery, and other things, one should wait in it, always bent on fighting: for if one lives (i. e. comes out victorious) one gets a kingdom, if one dies, one goes to heaven. Even weak men who live in one place are not over- powered (troubled) by even a strong man acting adversely as creepers growing together (lit. in one place) are not injured by even a strong wind blowing in a contrary direction. बलिना should also be taken with मरुता. साध्यन्ते v. 1. for a means brought under power; reduced to submission’. 54-56. Since even a large tree, strong and deep- rooted (well-imbedded in the earth) but growing singly can be uprooted by a strong (9) wind, but (a) the trees which grow in a mass and are firmly rooted are not uprooted even by a violent wind on account of their grow- ing in one place; so enemies consider a man who is single (unassisted) although possessed of valour, as capable of being vanquished and then they kill him, ga in S’l. 54 has no particular meaning; S’l. 55, should better have been omitted.

When an enemy is wicked and powerful one should deal with him distrustfully (cautiously) taking one’s stand on duplicity, now proposing peace, now fighting, &amp;c.-Therefore an enemy is easily extirpated by those who, themselves distrustful, secure his confidence and hold forth hopes (to him). Men well-versed in politics allow an enemy to grow strong once, though they have to uproot him: phlegmatic affection, when increased by means of molasses, is easily cured. एकभावः- एकः भावः feeling यस्य; acting with sameness of heart; hence honest, sincere. The man who acts honestly with women, an enemy, a treacherous friend and especially with harlots, does not live (i. e. he will be destroyed by them.) The duties towards gods, Bráhmaņas, one’s own self and one’s preceptor, should be performed with a devot- ed mind; the rest (other things) depends on (must be done with) duplicity (i. e. double dealing is necessary in other cases, honesty will not do). Oneness of action (sincerity) is always commend- able in the case of ascetics whose souls are purified (lit. imbued with the knowledge of the Supreme soul); but not in the case of men who are attached to women and especi ally of kings. 401 -by having recourse to cupidity (to be excit ed in the enemy.)

A talented man, though endowed with strength, should not turn another into his enemy: what wise man will needlessly swallow poison, thinking he has a doctor (to save his life)?

A talented man, expecting better days to come, should do the deed he has in his mind, of whatever kind, whether difficult or good or censurable; did not Arjuna whose hands had become hard on account of his touching the thick and flashing string of his bow,, Gândiva, live, with his girdle shining in his sportive dances? -the name of the bow of Arjuna, which he had obtained from the god of fire when he assisted him in consuming the Khándavavana, See Mahábhá, I. 225 &amp;c. -Arj. so called because he could pull his bow with equal force with either of his hands. 204.

(or although he had at his service his brothers &amp;c.) 205. The two sons of Mádrt, endowed with beauty and noble birth, and possessed of strength, became the servants of Viràta, being engaged as the keepers of cattle (and horses). P. 172.

Slokas 202-6 refer to the residence of the Pandavas in the house of Viràta under different disguises. Thus Dharma lived as Kamka, Bhima as Ballava or cook, Arjuna as Brhannatà, Nakula as master of the horses, Sahadeva as a cowherd and Draupadi as Sairandhri, doing menial work.

Enemies strike at their foes whenever they observe them to be careless with regard to their sitting, or lying down, or marching or while engaged in taking drink or food. 209.

Similarly, where is Sagara, who fixed the bounds of the sea! Sagara was a king of Ayo- dhya, of the solar race and a remote ancestor of Ráma. He was so called because, when born, he was affected with poison (Sa with, and gara poison). His sons, while engaged in the search of the sacrificial horse, excavated the earth and the tremendous chasm thus formed was filled with water and came to be known as the Ságara or sea. 435 P. 179. :-Prthu, son of Vena. He was pro- duced from the right arm of his dead father. He was a great king and the earth received its name Pṛthvi from him. See Pṛthu for other particulars in Apte’s S.

A king of the lunar race, the son of A’yus and grandson of Purûravas and father of Yayâti. He was a powerful and pious king. He was temporarily raised to the post of Indra when the latter lay concealed under waters to stone for his sin of Bráhman murder (for he had killed Vṛtra who was a Brahmana ). Anxious to win the love of Indránt, he, at her desire, caused himself to be conveyed to her house in a palanquin borne by the seven sages. On his way be asked the sages to move on quickly saying Sarpa, Sarpa. At this Agastya got angry and cursed him to be a Sarpa or serpent’, and he dropped down in aserpentine form from which he was relieved by Tudhishthira. &amp;c.-These, who shared with Indra his seat, with their chariots and best of elehants, are thought to be so made by the great Kâla and also taken off from the world, 235.

Works, accomplished by means of a policy of peace, never produce bad consequences. Like the minds of the good they always contribute to pleasure. 132. The wise man who employs the policy of punish- ment &amp;c.-is like the man who drinks the decoction of patola (3 Mar.) in a bilious affection when it can be easily put down by means of sugar. 133. quo-the rustling of leaves.

One should render the chief person on the side of the enemy an object of suspicion (or, win him over to one’s side) by false (cunningly written) writings and liberal gifts of money, as Chanakya did Rakshasa. Rakshasa, the minister of the Nandas, wishing to restore the Nanda dynasty entered into an alliance with Malayaketu, the son of Parvataka, and planned an expedition against Kusumapura, the capital of Chandra- gupta. Chanakya, however, by his stratagems succeeded in making him an object of supicion to the prince who dismissed him from his service afterwards. 140. A king should seduce the army (of the enemy) by bribery, since it can then be easily overpowered, like good timber when eaten through by worms. P. 181..141. See IV. sl. 108 p. 36. रक्ष्यः - should be prevented. उपप्र०—attracted or seduc ed by bribes. 142.

See supra sl. 62. P. 86. 147. R-for ftat. When a king employs other means than force in the case of an enemy, the latter, 438 knowing him to be a coward, marches against him of his own accord (even though unprovoked ). 148. 1st line.-What is the use of that wealth, though splendid (or, increasing) which is obtained without the display of valour ! 149. Wealth is certainly mentally possessed by every one; but in reality it is possessed by those who follow a very rigorous policy (lit. inflict severe punishment). 150. 2nd line:-But it is enjoyed, like a harlot, by those who are industrious and who pay money in the form of valour in a battle. 151. द्विषतां मूर्धसु पादम् अदत्वा पुरुषः श्रियं नाश्रुते, A man does not enjoy (or, get) wealth without placing his foot on the heads of his enemies, variegated with the jewels in their crowns and with their rays spreading upwards. 152. Wealth is drawn to themseves (by men) with arms which are of the size of the trunk of a powerful elephant and which are reddish brown by the bright rays of the shining (a) sword drawn in haste. See Kám, Nit, XIII, 14. 153. The wealth of the enemy reduced to submission by being overpowered by valour becomes, of her own accord, the wife of one, although gone to sleep on the lap of another (the enemy). 154. A man, always trying to rise, should adopt the course of action of the lion and enjoy the Sr of the enemy by seizing her by the hair (forcibly) as one does an im- modest woman. See Kám, Nit. XIII. 11. -advocating the object to be gained as de- pending on ‘force’. P. 183. -seizes, attacks. :-a member of a species attacks another of the same species. 439 156. Those, who, in this world, being destitute of mercy a full of apprehension, strike those who utter words of pity, who have sought their protection and who have received many wounds, go to Raurava and other hells. Another reading of the 2nd line is g भये सुखे वा. 157. 158. 159. -rich in Dak. and other things. See IV. 22. Even the crows do not eat the flesh of those, when dead, who, being honoured and having gained their, object, do not become grateful. P. 184. 160.

<li>He who being full of sloth neglects his enemy and a disease moving ( gaining strength) freely, is slowly killed by them.</li>

<li>He, who, being asked, does not say what is benefi- cial and salutary in the end, he-a minister and a speaker of sweet things (at the same time) is said to be simply
an enemy.
What is meant is this-a minister, when consulted, should not simply seek to please his master by saying what is agreeable to him but guide him rightly.</li>
<li>Read in the text after the fifth Sl.-go: go
सततं प्रियवादिनः । अप्रियस्य च पथ्यस्य वक्ता श्रोता च दुर्लभः ॥ It is always easy, O king, to find men who speak sweetly; but it is difficult to find one who speaks or one who (without being irritated) listens to what is wholesome although disagreeable.</li>
<li>Therefore, O king, let a consultation be held after retiring to a secluded place so that we shall find out the cause of his (enemy&rsquo;s) action and effectively check him.

<li>That enemy, who is very truthful (lit. rich in truth), pious, noble, possessed of a multitude of relatives, power- ful and victorious in many battles, is fit to be made peace with. Cf. Kam. Nit. IX. 42.</li>
<li>A friendly alliance should be formed even with a wicked person on knowing that there is danger to life, since when life is saved every thing else is also saved. For the first 1. see Kam. Nit. IX. 45.
&amp;c.-He, who has been victorious in many battles, is, for that reason, fit to be made peace with.</li>
<li>Enemies quickly fall into the power of him with whom the victor-of-many-battles forms a friendly alliance, owing to his prowess. see Kam. Nit, IX. 52,</li>
<li>One should desire to form peace even with one&rsquo;s equal, since victory in a battle is uncertain; no dangerous step should be taken (or, one should not risk his interest); so counsels Brhaspati. See Kam, Nit. IX, 59.</li>
<li>Victory in a battle, in the case of men fighting in this world, is doubtful: therefore that (a battle) should be had recourse to when the other three remedies (1, and) have been tried (i. e. after they fail.) ga The Par. is irregular; it is, however, found in the Veda and in epie poetry.</li>

<li>A lion, digging the hole of a mouse, filled with pieces of stone, gets his claws broken; or if he gets the fruit (of his labours, it is (simply) a mouse,</li>

See Kam. Nit. X. 32, 33.</li>

<li>One should not enter into an alliance with a man who is destitute of truthfulness and righteousness (or the principle of truthfulness ); for, although firmly allied, he, on account of his wickedness, will change beforelong.</li>
<li>An enemy who is cruel, very avaricious, lazy, re- gardless of truth, blundering (in policy ), timid, un- steady, foolish and a despiser of warriors, can easily be rooted ont (extirpated ).</li>

<li>In the case of an enemy manageable by (the use of) the fourth remedy (i. e.

<li>The lion, taking his stand on his high spirit (his great strength) plants his foot (paw) on the head of an intoxicated elephant, though the latter is superior in bulk, See Kâm, Nît, XIII. 16.</li>
<li>A small (weak) man, endowed with the power of energy, can kill even a big (or, physically strong) man, as a lion does an elephant :-so say the Bharadwajas. Cf. Kám. Nit. IX. 56.</li>
<li>Those enemies who can not be killed by (sheer) force, should be killed by using deceit, as Bhima killed Kichaka by assuming the disguise of a woman.</li>
<li>Enemies yield to the power of one whose punish- ment is very severe as ( people do to that of) the god of death who punishes cruelly (or who holds the fierce rod ); but they treat as straw him who puts up with every thing (is very mild).
P. 138. 33. What is the good of his being vainly born, whose lustre (valour) does not overpower that of spirited men (or, his powerful enemies) and who is, (therefore, only) the destroyer of his mother&rsquo;s youth.</li>
<li>That wealth, which is not marked (lit. whose body is not smeared) with the saffron in the form of the blood of the enemies, does not bring pleasure to the mind of talented men, though covetable,</li>
<li>What praise can belong to the life of that king whose territory is not copiously sprinkled with the blood of his enemies and with the water of the tears of their wives.

transgressed the bounds of propriety or acted villainously.
-marching away, flight.</li>
<li>Neither peace nor war, nothing else than a march against or from, is considered advisable in dealing with one who is superior in strength, wicked and acting improper- ly (Hataria lit. not keeping within the bounds of propriety).</li>
<li>Yána (marching off) is of two kinds:-one is for saving one&rsquo;s life and wealth (treasure) when in peril (when there is danger from the enemy threatening the loss of both); the other is of the form of an expedition by one (a king) desirous of conquest (i, e. one is flight for safety; the other an expedition by a powerful king confident of success. ). यात्रा ० - यात्रा 8 march for attack लक्षणं distin- guishing mark यस्य and is nearly equivalent to यात्रारूपं of the form of. faufg-Noun in a formed from the desidera. tive base of f.
91</li>
<li>The expedition into an enemy&rsquo;s territory by a con- queror, eminently powerful, is said to be very opportune (lit. commended) either in the month of Kârtika or Chaitra and in no other. कार्तिके - See Rag. IV. 14. मार्गशीर्ष and are also recommended as proper months for leading an expedition into an enemy&rsquo;s territory. See Man. Smr. VII, 282, These months are recommended because they are the months of plenty and are free from the obstruction of rain. Besides there is no danger of corn-fields being devastated,</li>
<li>(But) when the enemy is involved in a diffi- culty or has weak points, all times are spoken of (recom- mended) as fit for leading an attack. Cf. Man. Smṛ. VII. 183.</li>
<li>Having well effected the protection of one&rsquo;s own country by means of men who are brave, friendly (or trustworthy) and possessed of great strength one should
396
march against another&rsquo;s country already occupied by one&rsquo;s spies. -The attacking king should first know every particular about the enemy&rsquo;s country by means of his spies. See Man, Smr. VII. 184.</li>
<li>He, who attacks an enemy&rsquo;s country without know- ing its roads or any thing about provisions (a), water and corn (i. e. without knowing how to procure these or make arrangments for these ), ( not only fails to conquer that country, but) does not even return to his own country (i. e. is vanquished by his enemy and des troyed). arar V. 1. provisions of various kinds.

P. 139. -read aa. Therefore, O lord, it is not at all (a) proper for you to adopt the second kind (of Yána i. e. to undertake an expedition ); you should neither enter into a war nor propose peace with that powerful and wicked enemy.
-Wise men have recourse to object in view or looking to the cause adopt such a course.
flight with some forcing them to</li>
<li>The reason why a ram falls back (retreats) (when fighting) is that he should (be able to) strike (with great- er force ); the lion too contracts his body when wishing to leap (upon his prey) through great rage; with their motives concealed in their hearts and keeping their deliberations and movements secret, talented men put up with anything (f) disregarding it altogether ( i, e. waiting for an opportunity they suffer any insulte not caring for them).</li>
<li>He, who, finding that his enemy is powerful, quits his country, lives and gets his kingdom again like Yudhishthira (the eldest of the Pândavas ).
When Dharma lost his kingdom by gambling and was
397
asked to go into exile with his wife and brothers, he did so, knowing that his enemies were strong and his own party weak. He returned after living for twelve years in the forest and one year incognito, strengthened his party and wrested back his kingdom from the Kauravas.</li>
<li>The weak man, who, through pride, fights with a more powerful enemy, does what is desired by him ( his enemy) and brings destruction upon his own family.

<li>having got into its own place. - च्युतः-driven or dislodged from, परिभूयते—is despised or overpowered.</li>
<li>Attacked (besieged) by a powerful enemy a king should take shelter in a forest putting forth efforts: and stationed there he should call his friends to his help that he should effect his escape (or release). See Kâm, Nit. IV. 55.</li>
<li>He, who, with his mind bewildered by fear on hear ing of the approach of an enemy, leaves his own place, will not enter it again.</li>
<li>Like a serpent without fangs or an elephant with- out rut, a king, who is out of (leaves) his own place, is easily assailable by all creatures. -lit. approachable i. e. any one can go to him and insult him or attack him, org-Loc. for the Inst. It will be better to read rgft: 50. एकोपि शक्तानां शत्रूणां शतमपि योद्धुं सहेत् &amp;c. - Even one man&hellip;&hellip;will be able to fight with even
a hundred power- ful enemies &amp;c.
P. 140. 51, 52, The two Slokas ought to be taken
398
together. They constitute what is called gri. e. two S&rsquo;lokas forming one grammatical sentence. Cf. at युग्ममिति प्रोक्तं त्रिभिः श्लोकविशेषकम् । कलापकं चतुर्भिः स्यात्तदूर्ध्वं कुलकं स्मृतम् ॥
Therefore, having strengthened a fortress, furnishing it with brave warriors and provisions, surrounding it with a rampart and a ditch and embellishing it with machinery, and other things, one should wait in it, always bent on fighting: for if one lives (i. e. comes out victorious) one gets a kingdom, if one dies, one goes to heaven.</li>
<li>Even weak men who live in one place are not over- powered (troubled) by even a strong man acting adversely as creepers growing together (lit. in one place) are not injured by even a strong wind blowing in a contrary direction. बलिना should also be taken with मरुता. साध्यन्ते v. 1. for a means brought under power; reduced to submission&rsquo;.
54-56. Since even a large tree, strong and deep- rooted (well-imbedded in the earth) but growing singly can be uprooted by a strong (9) wind, but (a) the trees which grow in a mass and are firmly rooted are not uprooted even by a violent wind on account of their grow- ing in one place; so enemies consider a man who is single (unassisted) although possessed of valour, as capable of being vanquished and then they kill him,
ga in S&rsquo;l. 54 has no particular meaning; S&rsquo;l. 55, should better have been omitted. S&rsquo;lokas 54, 56-see Mah. Bhâr. Van, 36, 63, 64.

<li>The wind becomes the assistant (helper) of the fire that burns forests; but the same (wind) puts out a lamp: who has friendship for the lean (weak) ? v. 1 for at means &lsquo;regard or respect for.&quot;
एकान्तः-
-an absolute rule; the only course of action. -living together; hence union.&rsquo;
P. 141. 59. Just as a bamboo growing in a cluster thick and surrounded by other bamboos, cannot be cut down, so a king who has a number of assistants () cannot be destroyed though weak: See Kâm. Nit. IX, 46.
f: &amp;c.-If then there be a resort to (or one gets the support of) the best of men what to say then (that the combination will be irresistible ). उत्तमस्योत्तमेन वा संश्रयः,</li>

<li>When an enemy is wicked and powerful one should deal with him distrustfully (cautiously) taking one&rsquo;s stand on duplicity, now proposing peace, now fighting,
&amp;c.-Therefore an enemy is easily extirpated by those who, themselves distrustful, secure his confidence and hold forth hopes (to him).</li>
<li>Men well-versed in politics allow an enemy to grow strong once, though they have to uproot him: phlegmatic affection, when increased by means of molasses, is easily cured.</li>

<li>The duties towards gods, Bráhmaņas, one&rsquo;s own self and one&rsquo;s preceptor, should be performed with a devot- ed mind; the rest (other things) depends on (must be done with) duplicity (i. e. double dealing is necessary in other cases, honesty will not do).</li>
<li>Oneness of action (sincerity) is always commend- able in the case of ascetics whose souls are purified (lit. imbued with the knowledge of the Supreme soul); but not in the case of men who are attached to women and especi ally of kings.

202. A wise man, even though powerful, should, look- ing for better times, reside even with a mean person, dis- agreeable on account of harsh (lit. thunderbolt-like) words; did not Bhims, possessed of extraordinary strength live, as a cook, in the house of the king of the Matsya coun- try, with his hands occupied in holding the laddle, dirtied with smoke and engaged in troublesome tasks?
203. A talented man, expecting better days to come, should do the deed he has in his mind, of whatever kind, whether difficult or good or censurable; did not Arjuna whose hands had become hard on account of his touching the thick and flashing string of his bow,, Gândiva, live, with his girdle shining in his sportive dances?
-the name of the bow of Arjuna, which he had obtained from the god of fire when he assisted him in consuming the Khándavavana, See Mahábhá, I. 225 &amp;c.
-Arj. so called because he could pull his bow with equal force with either of his hands.
204. A wise man, earnestly wishing for success, should conceal his own might, although endowed with calibre and energy, and should depend upon the workings of fate, Did not the Majestic son of Dharma (Dharms, the eldest
427
Pandava) suffer trouble for a long time in the house of Viràta, together with his brothers who were equal in valour to Indra, Kubera ( the lord of wealth) and Yama? (or although he had at his service his brothers &amp;c.)
205. The two sons of Mádrt, endowed with beauty and noble birth, and possessed of strength, became the servants of Viràta, being engaged as the keepers of cattle (and horses).
P. 172. Did not Draupadi rub sandal in the house of the king of the Matsyas, being contemptuously addressed by the ladies in their pride as Sairandhrî ? even she, who, by her matchless beauty, by the qualities of youth, by birth in a noble family and by complexion, was like the goddess of wealth (Lakshmi), was reduced to a miserable condition according to the turn of adverse time (destiny).
Slokas 202-6 refer to the residence of the Pandavas in the house of Viràta under different disguises. Thus Dharma lived as Kamka, Bhima as Ballava or cook, Arjuna as Brhannatà, Nakula as master of the horses, Sahadeva as a cowherd and Draupadi as Sairandhri, doing menial work. See Tan. 1. p. 11.

209. Enemies strike at their foes whenever they observe them to be careless with regard to their sitting, or lying down, or marching or while engaged in taking drink or food.
209. Therefore, a wise man should, with every effort and diligently, save his own life, the abode of the collection of three (viz.Dharma, artha and Ka&rsquo;ma); for if he is care- less he is destroyed,
210. Whom, eating unwholesome things (or, not observing regimen ), do diseases not afflict? (i, e. they afflict every one). What bad minister does not stand guilty of mistakes in policy? whom does wealth not make proud (or haughty)? whom does Death not strike down? and whom do carnal pleasures, when resorted to, not give pain?
211. The reputation of a greedy person is lost; friend. ship of a wicked man; the family of one who gives up the actions proper for it; virtue of one given to amassing wealth; learning of one addicted to vice; happiness of a miser and the sovereignty of a king who has careless ministers, (i, e, when a man becomes greedy he loses his reputation; a wicked man loses the friendship of others &amp;c.)

212. A wise man should gain his object by placing insult in the front and honour in the back graund (i. e. always expecting insu.t at the hands of others and not honour as long as he has to gain his end ); for folly lies in losing on&rsquo;es object.
213. A talented man should even bear his enemies on his shoulder, looking to the time (. . when the time is such); many frogs were killed (and devoured) by a huge black-serpent (by doing so).

222. When a man destined to prosper undertakes s thing, his intellect expands (is able to take a full view of the business to be accomplished ), his memory becomes strong; his policy, leading to the desired results, is not thwarted; his speculative reasoning (or, foresight ) proves successful; his mind attains loftiness and he takes delight in doing laudable deeds. folde
aq &amp;c.-Sovereignty is obtained by a man endowed with (unerring) policy, munificence, &amp;c.
P. 177. 223. A man, who takes delight in the com- pany of a person who is munificent, brave and wise (learned), becomes meritorious (accomplished ); having merits he gets wealth and from wealth majesty; possessed of majesty he can enforce command and thence acquires kingdom.

Sagara was a king of Ayo- dhya, of the solar race and a remote ancestor of Ráma. He was so called because, when born, he was affected with poison (Sa with, and gara poison).
