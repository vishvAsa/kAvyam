TANTRA II.

P. 97. मित्रप्राप्तिकम् मित्रप्राप्ति 'The acquisition of friends and secondly 'the work descriptive of it,' by the 'rhetorical transference of an epithet'. 
1. 
:-Buddhi here means 'political insight, the power to know what measures to take in an emergency; sound statesmanship. Trans.-Wise men, gifted with genius and well-informed, accomplish their purposes quickly, although without means, like the crow, the mouse the deer and the tortoise. 
Ho-is Mahilapur or Meliapur, a town situated near Madras (called Mayilpur, or the city of the Peacock, in Tamil, the Maliarpha of Ptolemy). See Wilson's works Vol. IV. p. 11. 
०स्थः - situated. महो०-very lofty. उच्छ्राय height आ- -The hollows of which were occupied by. 10- which refreshed (comforted) multitudes of travellers by its shade. quo-a banian tree (the off-shoots of which go downwards and take root). 
2. The beasts of the forest () lay (rested) under its shade; its leaves all round were occupied by multitudes (flights) of birds; its hollows were inhabited by insects; troops of monkeys dwelt on its stretching branches; and the honey in its flowers was fearlessly drunk off by bees: thus affording happiness to multitudes of different crea- tures, that tree alone was all worthy of praise. A tree other than such is a burden to the earth. (or, every other tree was &c.) This sl. is attributed to the poet Bijaks in Sargadhara's Paddhati, No. 972 (Peterson). 
Swift-fier; light of foot (लघु पतनं यस्य) प्राणवा०-in quest of food.

-where I have my residence. लुब्धक - hunter. कालकूट - deadly poison -काल- मपि कूटयति (burns) - also called हालाहल-was the most viralent poison that sprang up from the churned ocean.

8. Unexpected death overtakes those who are over- powered by (lit. too much attached to) the greediness of tongue or those who live in the midst of water and who are ignorant (not cautious enough to save themselves), as it does the ignorant fish which live in water and which are drawn (to the bait) by the greediness of tongue. 
-or rather, (why blame them ?). This is used to modify or correct a previous statement. -Owing to the adverseness of fate. 
4. How could Rávana not know that it was wrong (a crime) to carry away, by force, the wife of another (Sità)? 
*The description of the fowler in the Mass. before Wilson, it appears, was more detailed. Cf. his remark- 
The fowler is very minutely described 'in the Pancha Tan- tra, as an inhabitant of the city, living by bird-catching, of an uncouth figure, with splay feet, and clumsy hands; round as a ball; sturdy, though advanced in years; clad in red garments, with his hair bound into a knot on his head, carry- ing a net and staff, and followed by dogs; in short, he looked like Destiny with the fatal noose; like the personification of Sin; like the heart of iniquity; like the monitor of the wicked; like the friend of Death." Wilson's works Vol. IV. p. 28.

How could Rama also not see the impossibility of a g old deer (being born)? Or how could Yudhishthira bring calamity upon himself by playing at dice (gambling) all at once (thoughtlessly )? Generally the intellect of those whose reasoning (discerning faculty) is bewildered (clouded) an impending calamity fails them (loses its acuteness). -Rávana, son of Vis'ravas and grandson of the sage Pulastya. दार-Lit. भ्रातॄन् दारयन्ति (cause the separation used in the pl. of) fa :. The word is Mas. and number. -This was Maricha, who assumed the form of a golden deer at the instance of Rávana and appeared before Sita while dwelling in Panchavati with Ráma and Lakshmana, in order to entice away Ráma, fo-Lit. firm in battle. This is an aluk Sama'sa, -through thought- lessness, Yud. always acted thoughtfully and yet he gambled. 
5. The intellects of (even) great men go astray (proceed in the wrong way) when they are caught into the snares of the god of death (are doomed) and whose power of judg- ment is obscured by Destiny. 
-With his stick raised. Har-On perceiving that, being aware of the fact that. 
6. He, whose presence of mind does not fail him in all (kinds of) difficulties, surmounts them without doubt, through the force of this (his behaviour i. e. his firmness of mind). 
7. The attitude of the great is the same whether in prosperity or adversity. The sun is red when he rises, and red in appearance also when he sets. 
हेलया with ease. सपा० with the net on नोचेत् — If on the other hand; else, if, fao-allowing yourselves to be bewildered or overpowered by fear. 
8. Threads although very thin and long (and so the more liable to give way), if many and lying evenly resist great tension (lit. many pullings) on account of their 
348 
multiplicity. The same similitude applies to (or, the same is the case with) the good (i. e. good men, although very weak can resist many difficulties and come out suc- cessful if acting in union with others &c.) The sl. is from Mah, Bhár. V. 36. 59. 
P. 99. 9. These, although mere birds, are carrying away my net being united; there is no doubt, however, that they will fall down as soon as they quarrel (among themselves). 
geo-being in close pursuit of them. -when they passed beyond the range of his sight. 
10. What is not to happen can never take place; and what is destined to take place comes to pass though no effort be made (for it). What is not destined to be (remain in one's possession) passes away even though lying on the palm of the hand (so sure in one's possession). 
11. When fate is adverse, if one comes by some fortune somehow, that passes off taking with it something else also, like the treasure Sankha (one of the nine treasures of Kubera). 
-in the bargain, to add to my misfortune. The means of supporting my family, 
maintenance. स्वस्थैः -with easy minds, free from fear, myo-To the north-eastern side of.

When calamity befalls all men equally no one but a friend would give assistance even though it be in mere words. -Perf of with has given and will give -advised. o-the fort (in the form) of his hole having a thousand (i. e. a large number of) openings or passages. Here सहस्र is used for a large number. अकुतो०- without fear from any side; in perfect safety. 
13. Just as a snake without fangs, or an elephant destitute of rut is reduced to submission by every one (or, falls into the power of all) so is a king without a fort. 
349 
14. Not even with a thousand elephants or a hundred thousand horses that end is gained by kings in a battle which is gained by them by having one fort, ferqa-the Atm, is probably for the metre. See I. 231. 
15. An archer (warrior) stationed on the wall (of a fort) can well engage a hundred. gefa-speak highly of, commend, fa-conversant with, see I. 232.

-with a steady (fearless) mind. 
16. Friends, full of affection and giving (who are a Hource of) delight to the eyes, come to the house of the magnanimous (alone) every day. 
- 
i, e आदित्यस्य &c. – see foot-note. अपूर्वाणि -ever new i. • they never cloy or become stale, ever give the same delight. 17. The happiness which is produced in the mind of him to whose house guests come every day is not found even in heaven. faa &c.-v. l. (see foot-note) no pleasure is equal to the delight which is found in his heart (he enjoys). 
18. In accordance with the law of fate (a) a man obtains the fruit of his good or bad actions (done in a previous life) from that (person or thing) by that cause, in that manner, at that time, the same, that much of it and there, from which, by which cause, in which manner, at which time, which, of which measure, and where it may be due to him. 
19. A bird descries flesh (bait) from a distance of a hundred and fifty yojanas (a yojana 8 or 10 miles); but the same bird does not notice, as fate would have it, the net standing near. 
20. Seeing the eclipsing (lit. tormentation) of the sun 
350 
and the moon by the planet Ràhu, the confinement of elephants, snakes and birds and the poverty of the talented I come to think-alas, Fate is all powerful! The sl. occurs in Bartribari; see Nit, s'at. 91. 
P. 101. 21. The birds that sport (move) in a part of the sky meet with ealamities; fishes are caught by experts from the deep with its unfathomable waters; of what conse- quence is a bad deed or a good deed in this world or what is the use of getting a position of advantage in this world? For the god of destruction, with his hand stretebed for- ward, catches all creatures (alike) even from a distance. The reading of the last line in the Hitopades' a is कालोहि व्यसन-

22. When a king always shows great respect to his Servants they, seeing that (taking that i. e. the respect shown, into consideration), do not leave him even when without wealth. 
23. Confidence ( of subjects) is the root of wealth; owing to that the elephant is the chief of a herd; while the lion, though lord of beasts, is not surrounded (attended upon) by the animals of the forest. 
is used as such, is treated as. 
V. 1. 
अपरं - besides, the other consideration is this. कदाचित्- goes with भवति. 
24. That master, who lives in happiness while his well- behaved servants are experiencing misery, goes to hell and comes to grief in this as well as in the next world. 
25. The king who has compassion for and divides gains equally among his servants can be well expected to protect even the three worlds. 
26. Since a man who has friends accomplishes objects, 
351 
even such as are difficult to be accomplisded, one should make friends that are one's equals. 
P. 102. बन्धमोक्ष:- बन्धात् मोक्षः how he was set free from the bonds, art af: &c.-Ob, how admirable the talent of this Hiranyaks, his strength and the provision of his fort, &c.-Then such exactly is the way (i. e. securing such trusty friends to assist in time) to effect (lit. which has for its object) the freedom (or release) of birds from bondage बन्धनात् मोक्षः बन्ध०क्षः स आत्मा यस्य । 
er 
but I, I on the other hand. 
27. Wise men, even though endowed with fullness (abundance, opulence) should make friends: for the sea, though entirely fall (of water), awaits the rise of the moon (to swell up).

28. Friendship and marriage are proper between those whose wealth is equal and whose families are of equal rank, and not between the fat and the lean (rich and poor). I. 284. Mah. Bhár. I. 132, 10. 
29. That foolish man, who, evil-minded (wanting in good sense) forms friendship with one who is his unegual, being inferior or superior to himself, meets with ridicule. -Here do I &c. -I will have recourse to sitting here without food till I die, see IV. p. 3.

31. The enmity due to some cause quickly terminates by means of remedial acts (good acts done to counteract the effcet of bad acts causing the enmity); natural enmity does not come to an end without the offering up of life (terminates with death alone). 
-brough about by, arising from, a cause. aceiro-by doing acts of kindness fit for (calculated to remove) it (i. e. the cause). ft-by any means. शष्पभुजः-graminivorous animals. ईश्वर - rich men सपत्नी०- rival or co-wives. -a Brahmana who strictly adheres to the rules of conduet laid down by the Vedas; Eo-those who swerve from the duties enjoined by the Vedas; hence pious and impious men. पतिव्रता -a woman entirely devoted to her husband, (पतिरेव व्रतं यस्या:), a chaste lady. कुलटा-भटतीति अटा कुलस्य अटा lit, one who wanders to a house; a comp. of the S'akandh- wádi class; a debauched or unchaste woman, &c.-not that every one kills every one, but one afflicts- causes anguish to-the soul.

heir apparent or Yuvara'ja and to entrust to him certain offices under him. See Rag. 111. 35 and notes thereon, 
स्वशक्त्या - according to his means. संभाव्य - having hon- oured. पितृमातरौ - should more correctly be मातापितरौ, as the mother ought to take precedence in a comp.; see H. G. 198.

क्षुत्वाम: 
113. One should secure that friend, the most desirable one (H), whose mind undergoes no change in prosperity (a lit. when he has wealth) and who ever remains a true friend. 
114. असंशयं - अविद्यमानः संशयः यस्मिन् The wise say that the testing of friends should be made in this world by these signs, so as to leave no doubt (about their sincerity) as that of the sacrificial fire is enjoined by those learned (in the sacrificial rites. ) 
115. He, who continues to be a friend when the time of adversity comes, is a true friend; when the time of prosperity comes even a wicked man becomes a friend. 
अत्रविषये -- as regards this subject. नीतिवि०-against the rules of conduct. 
116. No body is absolutely the friend of any one or the enemy of any one; for one is seen to be destroyed by a friend or saved by an enemy through some purpose (object to be gained). 
P. 120. 117. सिद्धमन्त्रं - cooked food. ०पभोग्यानि- capable of being enjoyed. faaf:-those who can dis-372 
tinguish between what is permanent and what is short- lived; hence able to take a proper view of things. faro-

118. Not even five steps do these hard-hearted riches accompany a man when going even to Yama's house (i. e. dead), although they be well collected, protected like life and not even used (as ornaments) on any part of the body. वियोजितैः- विशेषेण योजितैः, नियोजितैः would have been better. पञ्चपदी - पन्चानां पदानां समूहः lit five steps are not gone over. 
119. आमिष flesh. भक्ष्यते वित्त० -90 is a rich man fed upon every where i. e, his wealth is used in different ways &c. 
120. A king charges with crimes a man who is very rich although he be innocent (in order to extort money from him); while a poor man though guilty of an offence is left unmolested every where (as nothing can be got out of him). प्राप्तः दोषः यं असौ प्रा०. 
121. &c.-pain is felt when it is lost or is to be spent; fie upon wealth which is the resort of troubles. 
122. If these people were to wish for final beatitude and suffer even a hundredth part of those hardships which they, being full of ignorance and so longing for wealth, suffer, they would get it. 
वैराग्यं न कार्य - you should not show indifference to or cease to take interest in the concerns of this world owing to &c. 
123. What is considered to be his own or a foreign country in the case of a man, steady-minded and of high talent (a)? Whatever country he resorts to, the same he makes his own by the might of his arms; the lion quenches his thirst with the blood of the lords of elephants he kills, just in that forest which he, armed with his jaws, claws and tail, enters,

a treasure of wisdom. 
-a store of intelligence, -are not to be compared 
with an ordinary person, i. e, you stand far above ordinary 
men. 
125. The goddess of wealth comes, of her own accord, to reside with a man who is endowed with energy, who is not dilatory, who knows the theory and practice (of doing a thing), who is not addicted to vices, who is brave and who is grateful and firm in friendship. fo-not procras- tinating or slow in accomplishing a business.hol 
P. 121.1-by the operation of destiny (lit. coming of the result of past actions). 
-what is not one's own i. e, what one is not destined to enjoy. 
126. A man is not able to enjoy wealth (even) after acquiring it (when fate so wills it) like Saumilaka who was bewildered on reaching a large forest. -cannot mean here foolish.' It means who was perplexed, who did not know what to do owing to adverse fate. 
-who knew -possessed of 
० रन्जितानि - chequered or variegated with the weaving of threads in different ways. पार्थिवो ० -- पार्थिवानामुचितानि fit for kings (to wear). Go-more than what was necessary for procuring food and clothing. only how to weave coarse cloth. a large fortune; were in highly prosperous circumstances. -rich in, error-lit, does not owe me any- thing; does not yield me anything proportionate to my labours; I shall not prosper here; cf. the Mar, word ( धारजिणी नसणें ). मिथ्याप्रo it is a wrong saying that. 
127. प्राप्त्या पूर्वजन्म कृतकर्मफलप्राप्त्या इत्यर्थः. 
That birds fiy 
into the sky or descend to the surface of the earth (in search of a thing) is according to the results of their 
374 
actions in a previous existence (i. e. even the movements of birds in search of food &c. are regulated by the law of Karman); for nothing comes to us that is not given previously (and thus laid in store for us ). 
128. What is not destined to happen does not surely happen, and what is fated to take place takes place even without an effort (on our part); what is not destined to be (with us) vanishes although placed on the palm of the hand (so near in our possession). 
129. Just as a calf finds out its mother even from the midst of thousands of cows, so the action done in a previ- ous life follows its author (doer). 
130. तिष्ठेत्व० - तिष्ठेत् तु अथ construe अथ नराणां प्राक्तनं कर्म शयामेन सह शेते &c. आत्मना सह तिष्ठेत् it remains with ( sticking to) the soul i. e. the law of Karman operates throughout one's existence. 
131. Just as shadow and light are always connected with each other so are action and its doer invariably linked to each other. if the mas, is aganist gram.; 
it should be संश्लिष्टे 
-be devoted to, or engaged in your business here with close application, ser fan-here so means a strenuous effort, adventure (such as going to a foreign land &c.) 
P. 122. 132. Just as clapping is not possible with one hand, so the fruit of action is not known to appear forth if unaccompanied with an effort (industry) 
133. Lo! The food oblained at meal-time through the working of fate (luckily) can not enter the mouth by any means without the exertion of the hand (unless the hand is used) 
134. The goddess of wealth approaches (comes to abide with) the lion-like (eminent) man who is industrious; 
375 
it is the weak-minded (lazy persons) who say-it is fate, it is fate (that gives ); setting aside fate entirely put forth manly effort to the best of your strength; for if after an effort is made there be no success where is the fault in the case? ( i, e. one is not to blame ); or, see- where was the fault? Where was I wrong? See Hit. I. 37. Intro. 
135. Objects desired to be accomplished succeed by in- dustry and not by idle wishes; the animals of the forest do not certainly enter the mouth of a lion that is asleep (if he sleeps). 
136. Desires are not accomplished, O king, without exertion; it is the cowardly who say-what is destined to happen comes to pass. 
137. प्रयच्छति - The subject to this is कर्मकरणं. If a man ex- erts himself (lit, does an act) to the best of his ability and (yet it) does not lead to success he is not to blame in that case; for his manly effort is thwarted or rendered vain (lit. concealed) by fate.

What is to be done with that wealth which re- mains an exclusive possession (is confined to one man) like a wife, and which is not enjoyed by all passers by being common property like a harlot, See V. 37. 
139. The man who has a store of wealth is served in this world though he may be miserly, low-born and always avoided by good men (as unworthy to associate with ).

146. Worthy of salutation (praise-worthy) are those who abide by their, resolution once formed; a (mere) high station is not of any use of what consequence is the poor chátaka bird that has Indra for its water-bearer? - कृतः निश्चयः कृतः a resolution once formed; सोस्त्येषi those who stick to that. The second line is meant to illustrate the statement in the first line. The chàtaka is an insignificant bird and yet it never swerves from its determination to drink rain water alone. Indra, the mightiest of gods, is the god of rain; and as such, in spite of his greatness he has to do the servile duty of supplying water to the little bird.

P. 125. 147. A man is able, in this world, to manage all his affairs independently (of his own free will) so long as he is not forcibly held back by being checked (lit. wounded) by the goad in the form of his wife's words ( advice).

150. The fruit of the (study of the) Vedas is the keeping up of the sacred fire (i, e, the study of the Vedas ought to induce. a man to be an agnihotrin) and the fruit of sacred lore is character and wealth; the marrying of a wife has for its fruit conjugal pleasure and offspring and the fruit of (the possession of) wealth is charity and enjoyment. 
&o.-I do not at all want to be, I have nothing to do with being. -If it be barren of, if it fails to give enjoyment. 
151. If people are to be considered as wealthy by that wealth which is buried in the house, why should we not call ourselves rich by that same wealth (since they derive as little benefit from it as we). 
152. Giving away in charity is the real saving of money just as giving escape to the water lying in a lake is the proper mode of its preservation (keeping it in a good condition). 
153. As regards wealth, it should be given away in charity and enjoyed, but should not be merely stored ups for lo, how others take away the wealth (honey) of the bees stored up by them.

154. Charity, enjoyment and loss-these three are the ways in which money finds its passage out; he who neither gives away his wealth nor enjoys it, has the third course left to his money (to pass off). 
furq &c.-for merely keeping it hoarded up, since it leads to trouble. 
155. Serpents drink in (live upon) the wind and yet they are not weak; wild elephants, although they live upon dry grass, gain strength; the best of sages pass their time (subsisting on) roots and fruits; contentment is the highest treasure of man. 
156. Whence can those, who are greedy of wealth and run here and there in search of it, get that happiness which is the possession of those who are satisfied with the nectar of contentment and whose minds are tranquil ? 
157. Great is the happiness enjoyed by those who feast on (lit. drink) nectar-like contentment; while unin- terrupted misery is the lot of those men who are discon- tented. 
158. When the mind is curbed all the organs of sense are also curbed; when the sun is hidden by the clouds his rays too would be concealed. 
159. Great sages, who are tranquil-minded, say that putting an end to desire means the peace of mind; desire is not removed (lit. does not turn back) by the enjoy- ment of objects as thirst is not by resorting to fire. 
160. What, indeed, do men not do for the sake of wealth? They censure even those who do not deserve to be censured and highly praise those who are unworthy of praise, 
161. Desire for wealth, even when a man has it for the sake of religious duties, does not do him any good (and sbould therefore be given up ); for it is better not to touch 
381 
mud, keeping at a distance, than to wash it off afterwards. For शुभा०—there is another reading सुखावहा which is not so good. 
162. In this world there is no other treasure equal to (the merit arising from ) charity; there is no other enemy than greed; there is no ornament equal to (precious like ) good disposition; and there is no other kind of wealth which equals contentment. The reading af for faf in 
विधि निधि the first line means 'duty, an act enjoined by sacred law'. 
163. That there should be want of wealth in the form of self-respect is the highest form of poverty: S'iva's (only) wealth is an old bull; and yet he is the greatest of gods. 
The idea expressed here is this-It is not really want of money, but want of self-respect, that constitutes real poverty, as exemplified in the case of S'iva, who, thongh having no other kind of wealth than his old bull, is yet most dreaded and regarded as the greatest god owing to his sense of self-respect.

167. Two remedies are here (in this S'ástra) prescribed (pointed out) for one's escape when an enemy appears:- one is from the (skilful) movement of the hands (i. e. dis- playing valour by using one's weapons skilfully); the other arises from the fleetness of feet (i. e. by having recourse to a swift flight).

168. Men of talent, who wear the cloaks of horripila- tion caused by their tasting the flavour of good sayings (conversation on charming subjects) live happily even without the company of women. What is meant is- The touch of a woman's body causes the hair to stand on end; this is done in the case of talented men by the pleasu- rable sensation caused by good or pithy sayings in the course of their conversation and so they feel happy. 
169. What donation can he, who does not lay by a store of pithy sayings, give in sacrifices in the form of discourses? I, e, what witty saying can he put forth when

there is an occasion for doing so in the course of a con- versation? he will have to keep quiet and so will have to cut a sorry figure.
