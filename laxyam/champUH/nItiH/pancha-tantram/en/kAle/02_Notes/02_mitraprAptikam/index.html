How could Rávana not know that it was wrong (a crime) to carry away, by force, the wife of another (Sità)? *The description of the fowler in the Mass. before Wilson, it appears, was more detailed. Cf. his remark- The fowler is very minutely described ‘in the Pancha Tan- tra, as an inhabitant of the city, living by bird-catching, of an uncouth figure, with splay feet, and clumsy hands; round as a ball; sturdy, though advanced in years; clad in red garments, with his hair bound into a knot on his head, carry- ing a net and staff, and followed by dogs; in short, he looked like Destiny with the fatal noose; like the personification of Sin; like the heart of iniquity; like the monitor of the wicked; like the friend of Death.&#34; Wilson’s works Vol. IV. p. 28. 347 by How could Rama also not see the impossibility of a g old deer (being born)? Or how could Yudhishthira bring calamity upon himself by playing at dice (gambling) all at once (thoughtlessly )?

The happiness which is produced in the mind of him to whose house guests come every day is not found even in heaven. faa &amp;c.-v. l. (see foot-note) no pleasure is equal to the delight which is found in his heart (he enjoys). 18. In accordance with the law of fate (a) a man obtains the fruit of his good or bad actions (done in a previous life) from that (person or thing) by that cause, in that manner, at that time, the same, that much of it and there, from which, by which cause, in which manner, at which time, which, of which measure, and where it may be due to him. 19. A bird descries flesh (bait) from a distance of a hundred and fifty yojanas (a yojana 8 or 10 miles); but the same bird does not notice, as fate would have it, the net standing near. 20. Seeing the eclipsing (lit. tormentation) of the sun 350 and the moon by the planet Ràhu, the confinement of elephants, snakes and birds and the poverty of the talented I come to think-alas, Fate is all powerful! The sl. occurs in Bartribari; see Nit, s’at. 91. P. 101. 21. The birds that sport (move) in a part of the sky meet with ealamities; fishes are caught by experts from the deep with its unfathomable waters; of what conse- quence is a bad deed or a good deed in this world or what is the use of getting a position of advantage in this world? For the god of destruction, with his hand stretebed for- ward, catches all creatures (alike) even from a distance.

V. 1. अपरं - besides, the other consideration is this. कदाचित्- goes with भवति. 24. That master, who lives in happiness while his well- behaved servants are experiencing misery, goes to hell and comes to grief in this as well as in the next world. 25. The king who has compassion for and divides gains equally among his servants can be well expected to protect even the three worlds. 26. Since a man who has friends accomplishes objects, 351 even such as are difficult to be accomplisded, one should make friends that are one’s equals.

Friendship and marriage are proper between those whose wealth is equal and whose families are of equal rank, and not between the fat and the lean (rich and poor). I. 284. Mah. Bhár. I. 132, 10. 29. That foolish man, who, evil-minded (wanting in good sense) forms friendship with one who is his unegual, being inferior or superior to himself, meets with ridicule. -Here do I &amp;c. -I will have recourse to sitting here without food till I die, see IV. p. 3. 30.

P. 97. मित्रप्राप्तिकम् मित्रप्राप्ति ‘The acquisition of friends and secondly ’the work descriptive of it,’ by the ‘rhetorical transference of an epithet’. 1. :-Buddhi here means ‘political insight, the power to know what measures to take in an emergency; sound statesmanship. Trans.-Wise men, gifted with genius and well-informed, accomplish their purposes quickly, although without means, like the crow, the mouse the deer and the tortoise. Ho-is Mahilapur or Meliapur, a town situated near Madras (called Mayilpur, or the city of the Peacock, in Tamil, the Maliarpha of Ptolemy). See Wilson’s works Vol. IV. p. 11. ०स्थः - situated. महो०-very lofty. उच्छ्राय height आ- -The hollows of which were occupied by. 10- which refreshed (comforted) multitudes of travellers by its shade. quo-a banian tree (the off-shoots of which go downwards and take root). 2. The beasts of the forest () lay (rested) under its shade; its leaves all round were occupied by multitudes (flights) of birds; its hollows were inhabited by insects; troops of monkeys dwelt on its stretching branches; and the honey in its flowers was fearlessly drunk off by bees: thus affording happiness to multitudes of different crea- tures, that tree alone was all worthy of praise. A tree other than such is a burden to the earth. (or, every other tree was &amp;c.) This sl. is attributed to the poet Bijaks in Sargadhara’s Paddhati, No. 972 (Peterson). Swift-fier; light of foot (लघु पतनं यस्य) प्राणवा०-in quest of food. going to. 346 -with the intention or object of sit-with o-with chilblained feet, splay-footed, o-with hair raised up (being tied into a knot). OTPA i. e. looking as hedious as.* -where I have my residence. लुब्धक - hunter. कालकूट - deadly poison -काल- मपि कूटयति (burns) - also called हालाहल-was the most viralent poison that sprang up from the churned ocean. P. 98. fargar-white like the flowers of the Sind, tree (सिन्दुवारः श्वेतपुष्पः). वाक्यार्गलया &amp;c. - held back, kept in check, by the bolt in the form of. fa-Lit, speckle- necked (चित्रा ग्रीवा यस्य). सहस्र० - सहस्रं परिवारो यस्य with a retinue of a thousand followers. ao-warned against, disuaded from. f-was confined or caught into the net. 8. Unexpected death overtakes those who are over- powered by (lit. too much attached to) the greediness of tongue or those who live in the midst of water and who are ignorant (not cautious enough to save themselves), as it does the ignorant fish which live in water and which are drawn (to the bait) by the greediness of tongue. -or rather, (why blame them ?). This is used to modify or correct a previous statement. -Owing to the adverseness of fate. 4. How could Rávana not know that it was wrong (a crime) to carry away, by force, the wife of another (Sità)? *The description of the fowler in the Mass. before Wilson, it appears, was more detailed. Cf. his remark- The fowler is very minutely described ‘in the Pancha Tan- tra, as an inhabitant of the city, living by bird-catching, of an uncouth figure, with splay feet, and clumsy hands; round as a ball; sturdy, though advanced in years; clad in red garments, with his hair bound into a knot on his head, carry- ing a net and staff, and followed by dogs; in short, he looked like Destiny with the fatal noose; like the personification of Sin; like the heart of iniquity; like the monitor of the wicked; like the friend of Death.&#34; Wilson’s works Vol. IV. p. 28. 347 by How could Rama also not see the impossibility of a g old deer (being born)? Or how could Yudhishthira bring calamity upon himself by playing at dice (gambling) all at once (thoughtlessly )? Generally the intellect of those whose reasoning (discerning faculty) is bewildered (clouded) an impending calamity fails them (loses its acuteness). -Rávana, son of Vis’ravas and grandson of the sage Pulastya. दार-Lit. भ्रातॄन् दारयन्ति (cause the separation used in the pl. of) fa :. The word is Mas. and number. -This was Maricha, who assumed the form of a golden deer at the instance of Rávana and appeared before Sita while dwelling in Panchavati with Ráma and Lakshmana, in order to entice away Ráma, fo-Lit. firm in battle. This is an aluk Sama’sa, -through thought- lessness, Yud. always acted thoughtfully and yet he gambled. 5. The intellects of (even) great men go astray (proceed in the wrong way) when they are caught into the snares of the god of death (are doomed) and whose power of judg- ment is obscured by Destiny. -With his stick raised. Har-On perceiving that, being aware of the fact that. 6. He, whose presence of mind does not fail him in all (kinds of) difficulties, surmounts them without doubt, through the force of this (his behaviour i. e. his firmness of mind). 7. The attitude of the great is the same whether in prosperity or adversity. The sun is red when he rises, and red in appearance also when he sets. हेलया with ease. सपा० with the net on नोचेत् — If on the other hand; else, if, fao-allowing yourselves to be bewildered or overpowered by fear. 8. Threads although very thin and long (and so the more liable to give way), if many and lying evenly resist great tension (lit. many pullings) on account of their 348 multiplicity. The same similitude applies to (or, the same is the case with) the good (i. e. good men, although very weak can resist many difficulties and come out suc- cessful if acting in union with others &amp;c.) The sl. is from Mah, Bhár. V. 36. 59. P. 99. 9. These, although mere birds, are carrying away my net being united; there is no doubt, however, that they will fall down as soon as they quarrel (among themselves). geo-being in close pursuit of them. -when they passed beyond the range of his sight. 10. What is not to happen can never take place; and what is destined to take place comes to pass though no effort be made (for it). What is not destined to be (remain in one’s possession) passes away even though lying on the palm of the hand (so sure in one’s possession). 11. When fate is adverse, if one comes by some fortune somehow, that passes off taking with it something else also, like the treasure Sankha (one of the nine treasures of Kubera). -in the bargain, to add to my misfortune. The means of supporting my family, maintenance. स्वस्थैः -with easy minds, free from fear, myo-To the north-eastern side of. 12. When calamity befalls all men equally no one but a friend would give assistance even though it be in mere words. -Perf of with has given and will give -advised. o-the fort (in the form) of his hole having a thousand (i. e. a large number of) openings or passages. Here सहस्र is used for a large number. अकुतो०- without fear from any side; in perfect safety. 13. Just as a snake without fangs, or an elephant destitute of rut is reduced to submission by every one (or, falls into the power of all) so is a king without a fort. 349 14. Not even with a thousand elephants or a hundred thousand horses that end is gained by kings in a battle which is gained by them by having one fort, ferqa-the Atm, is probably for the metre. See I. 231. 15. An archer (warrior) stationed on the wall (of a fort) can well engage a hundred. gefa-speak highly of, commend, fa-conversant with, see I. 232. P.100. तारस्व० - in a loud voice; तारश्चासौ स्वरश्च तेन । महती- trying, critical, 5-state of my danger; or the danger I am in. To-critical situation. -very great. goo-horripilated, with the hair standing on end, fer- -with a steady (fearless) mind. 16. Friends, full of affection and giving (who are a Hource of) delight to the eyes, come to the house of the magnanimous (alone) every day. i, e आदित्यस्य &amp;c. – see foot-note. अपूर्वाणि -ever new i. • they never cloy or become stale, ever give the same delight. 17. The happiness which is produced in the mind of him to whose house guests come every day is not found even in heaven. faa &amp;c.-v. l. (see foot-note) no pleasure is equal to the delight which is found in his heart (he enjoys). 18. In accordance with the law of fate (a) a man obtains the fruit of his good or bad actions (done in a previous life) from that (person or thing) by that cause, in that manner, at that time, the same, that much of it and there, from which, by which cause, in which manner, at which time, which, of which measure, and where it may be due to him. 19. A bird descries flesh (bait) from a distance of a hundred and fifty yojanas (a yojana 8 or 10 miles); but the same bird does not notice, as fate would have it, the net standing near. 20. Seeing the eclipsing (lit. tormentation) of the sun 350 and the moon by the planet Ràhu, the confinement of elephants, snakes and birds and the poverty of the talented I come to think-alas, Fate is all powerful! The sl. occurs in Bartribari; see Nit, s’at. 91. P. 101. 21. The birds that sport (move) in a part of the sky meet with ealamities; fishes are caught by experts from the deep with its unfathomable waters; of what conse- quence is a bad deed or a good deed in this world or what is the use of getting a position of advantage in this world? For the god of destruction, with his hand stretebed for- ward, catches all creatures (alike) even from a distance. The reading of the last line in the Hitopades’ a is कालोहि व्यसन- To which is better. a term of address expressive of affection. Good friend, mso-servants come after their master; the master has precedence over the servant, creatures. gal-even this much. poor 22. When a king always shows great respect to his Servants they, seeing that (taking that i. e. the respect shown, into consideration), do not leave him even when without wealth. 23. Confidence ( of subjects) is the root of wealth; owing to that the elephant is the chief of a herd; while the lion, though lord of beasts, is not surrounded (attended upon) by the animals of the forest. is used as such, is treated as. V. 1. अपरं - besides, the other consideration is this. कदाचित्- goes with भवति. 24. That master, who lives in happiness while his well- behaved servants are experiencing misery, goes to hell and comes to grief in this as well as in the next world. 25. The king who has compassion for and divides gains equally among his servants can be well expected to protect even the three worlds. 26. Since a man who has friends accomplishes objects, 351 even such as are difficult to be accomplisded, one should make friends that are one’s equals. P. 102. बन्धमोक्ष:- बन्धात् मोक्षः how he was set free from the bonds, art af: &amp;c.-Ob, how admirable the talent of this Hiranyaks, his strength and the provision of his fort, &amp;c.-Then such exactly is the way (i. e. securing such trusty friends to assist in time) to effect (lit. which has for its object) the freedom (or release) of birds from bondage बन्धनात् मोक्षः बन्ध०क्षः स आत्मा यस्य । er but I, I on the other hand. 27. Wise men, even though endowed with fullness (abundance, opulence) should make friends: for the sea, though entirely fall (of water), awaits the rise of the moon (to swell up). बन्धन० - बन्धनं शेषः विशेषाद० - hiding fro-hiding o-on a weighty or im- चित्रग्रीव०- imitating the voice of Chi. यस्य remaining still confined in the net. himself inside still more. portant business. मैत्रीविरो०- मैत्र्या विरोधस्तस्य भावात्. owing to friendship being contrary or opposed to the natural course of things. farrara-( see V. 1.) owing to our antipathy. 28. Friendship and marriage are proper between those whose wealth is equal and whose families are of equal rank, and not between the fat and the lean (rich and poor). I. 284. Mah. Bhár. I. 132, 10. 29. That foolish man, who, evil-minded (wanting in good sense) forms friendship with one who is his unegual, being inferior or superior to himself, meets with ridicule. -Here do I &amp;c. -I will have recourse to sitting here without food till I die, see IV. p. 3. 30. One should not make an alliance with an enemy even though the peace be compactly formed. E-Lit the purifier, fr. q. 4 does extinguish or put out. P. 103. gr-what is not proper (for you to say), 352 what does not stand to reason. -due to some act (on the part of persons, such as insulting one, deceiving one &amp;c.), resulting from some cause. 31. The enmity due to some cause quickly terminates by means of remedial acts (good acts done to counteract the effcet of bad acts causing the enmity); natural enmity does not come to an end without the offering up of life (terminates with death alone). -brough about by, arising from, a cause. aceiro-by doing acts of kindness fit for (calculated to remove) it (i. e. the cause). ft-by any means. शष्पभुजः-graminivorous animals. ईश्वर - rich men सपत्नी०- rival or co-wives. -a Brahmana who strictly adheres to the rules of conduet laid down by the Vedas; Eo-those who swerve from the duties enjoined by the Vedas; hence pious and impious men. पतिव्रता -a woman entirely devoted to her husband, (पतिरेव व्रतं यस्या:), a chaste lady. कुलटा-भटतीति अटा कुलस्य अटा lit, one who wanders to a house; a comp. of the S’akandh- wádi class; a debauched or unchaste woman, &amp;c.-not that every one kills every one, but one afflicts- causes anguish to-the soul.

4. How could Rávana not know that it was wrong (a crime) to carry away, by force, the wife of another (Sità)?
*The description of the fowler in the Mass. before Wilson, it appears, was more detailed. Cf. his remark-
The fowler is very minutely described &lsquo;in the Pancha Tan- tra, as an inhabitant of the city, living by bird-catching, of an uncouth figure, with splay feet, and clumsy hands; round as a ball; sturdy, though advanced in years; clad in red garments, with his hair bound into a knot on his head, carry- ing a net and staff, and followed by dogs; in short, he looked like Destiny with the fatal noose; like the personification of Sin; like the heart of iniquity; like the monitor of the wicked; like the friend of Death.&quot; Wilson&rsquo;s works Vol. IV. p. 28.

How could Rama also not see the impossibility of a g old deer (being born)? Or how could Yudhishthira bring calamity upon himself by playing at dice (gambling) all at once (thoughtlessly )?

P. 125. 147. A man is able, in this world, to manage all his affairs independently (of his own free will) so long as he is not forcibly held back by being checked (lit. wounded) by the goad in the form of his wife&rsquo;s words ( advice).
148. A man incited (impelled) by the words of a woman thinks what is unfit to be done as fit to do, what is difficult to go to as of easy access and be eaten as fit to eat.

150. The fruit of the (study of the) Vedas is the keeping up of the sacred fire (i, e, the study of the Vedas ought to induce. a man to be an agnihotrin) and the fruit of sacred lore is character and wealth; the marrying of a wife has for its fruit conjugal pleasure and offspring and the fruit of (the possession of) wealth is charity and enjoyment.
&amp;o.-I do not at all want to be, I have nothing to do with being. -If it be barren of, if it fails to give enjoyment.
151. If people are to be considered as wealthy by that wealth which is buried in the house, why should we not call ourselves rich by that same wealth (since they derive as little benefit from it as we).
152. Giving away in charity is the real saving of money just as giving escape to the water lying in a lake is the proper mode of its preservation (keeping it in a good condition).
153. As regards wealth, it should be given away in charity and enjoyed, but should not be merely stored ups for lo, how others take away the wealth (honey) of the bees stored up by them.
380
154. Charity, enjoyment and loss-these three are the ways in which money finds its passage out; he who neither gives away his wealth nor enjoys it, has the third course left to his money (to pass off).
furq &amp;c.-for merely keeping it hoarded up, since it leads to trouble.
155. Serpents drink in (live upon) the wind and yet they are not weak; wild elephants, although they live upon dry grass, gain strength; the best of sages pass their time (subsisting on) roots and fruits; contentment is the highest treasure of man.
156. Whence can those, who are greedy of wealth and run here and there in search of it, get that happiness which is the possession of those who are satisfied with the nectar of contentment and whose minds are tranquil ?
157. Great is the happiness enjoyed by those who feast on (lit. drink) nectar-like contentment; while unin- terrupted misery is the lot of those men who are discon- tented.
158. When the mind is curbed all the organs of sense are also curbed; when the sun is hidden by the clouds his rays too would be concealed.
159. Great sages, who are tranquil-minded, say that putting an end to desire means the peace of mind; desire is not removed (lit. does not turn back) by the enjoy- ment of objects as thirst is not by resorting to fire.
160. What, indeed, do men not do for the sake of wealth? They censure even those who do not deserve to be censured and highly praise those who are unworthy of praise,
161. Desire for wealth, even when a man has it for the sake of religious duties, does not do him any good (and sbould therefore be given up ); for it is better not to touch
381
mud, keeping at a distance, than to wash it off afterwards. For शुभा०—there is another reading सुखावहा which is not so good.
162. In this world there is no other treasure equal to (the merit arising from ) charity; there is no other enemy than greed; there is no ornament equal to (precious like ) good disposition; and there is no other kind of wealth which equals contentment. The reading af for faf in
विधि निधि the first line means &lsquo;duty, an act enjoined by sacred law&rsquo;.
163. That there should be want of wealth in the form of self-respect is the highest form of poverty: S&rsquo;iva&rsquo;s (only) wealth is an old bull; and yet he is the greatest of gods.
The idea expressed here is this-It is not really want of money, but want of self-respect, that constitutes real poverty, as exemplified in the case of S&rsquo;iva, who, thongh having no other kind of wealth than his old bull, is yet most dreaded and regarded as the greatest god owing to his sense of self-respect.

167. Two remedies are here (in this S&rsquo;ástra) prescribed (pointed out) for one&rsquo;s escape when an enemy appears:- one is from the (skilful) movement of the hands (i. e. dis- playing valour by using one&rsquo;s weapons skilfully); the other arises from the fleetness of feet (i. e. by having recourse to a swift flight).</h2>

168. Men of talent, who wear the cloaks of horripila- tion caused by their tasting the flavour of good sayings (conversation on charming subjects) live happily even without the company of women. What is meant is- The touch of a woman&rsquo;s body causes the hair to stand on end; this is done in the case of talented men by the pleasu- rable sensation caused by good or pithy sayings in the course of their conversation and so they feel happy.
169. What donation can he, who does not lay by a store of pithy sayings, give in sacrifices in the form of discourses? I, e, what witty saying can he put forth when

Even profoundly learned men are not able, by the power of their talent to wipe off the line of characters formed (written) on the forehead by the Creator ( i, e. go against the predestined course of destiny).
