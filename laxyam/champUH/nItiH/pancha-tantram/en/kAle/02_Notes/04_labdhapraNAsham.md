-irrelevant, nonsensical अनं - Vegetable food. विहिताः are design- ed as food. 
56. What is ordained as one's proper food does not make one guilty of sin; if one eats what is not proper for one to eat, there is great sin in it; therefore no exchange of duty should be caused (i. e. one should not ask another to do what is not proper to be done ). 
57. Cons.:-nat negata Rafa&c.-As wine in the case of Brahmanas, as sacrificial food in the case of those habituated to drink wine, becomes unfit to be eaten though proper for others to eat, so is the case, oh Brahmana, with others also. In this sl. the ris explained. The meaning is-every one is justified in eating his proper food. 
58. Good attends those who eat their proper food; what is improper to be eaten (if eaten ) leads to great sin; how can it be then proper for you to punish me as one acting improperly? Supply a after genan. It will be 
460 
better to read ago not acting improperly; or qua oh you who are not acting properly. 
art &c.-Moreover, such is not the duty (i. e. to punish others) of sages; for they should consider what is seen as unseen, and what is heard as unheard, and be free from greediness and enmity: such conduct is com- mended for them. 
59.-60. Of sages blameless (praiseworthy) and following the path of good conduct (virtue) he is esteemed the highest who is the same to friend or foe, who treats a lump of earth, a stone or gold as of equal value, who is indifferent to well-wishers and friends, who remains neutral towards those who are the object of hatred or relations and who regards equally the good and the sinful. A practiser of Yoga should always devote himself to ab- straction, remaining in a secret place. 
These lines, with the exception of argai &c. are quoted from the Bhagavatgîtà but very indifferently. Thus the first line is made up of parts from XII. 18, and VI, 8; the two lines. -fasa make one sl. in the Gitá viz. VI. 9. and the line a forms part of the next sl. The line सुहृन्मित्रे is again changed, the original reading being सुहृन्मि- त्रार्युदासीनमध्यस्थद्वेष्य बन्धुषु ।

Crying out let go your hold, let go your hold, one fell off from virtue, and another by saying 'don't let go'; seeing the fall of both (the third remained quiet): silence leads to the accomplishment of all objects. Or we may supply तृतीयः and अभजत; तृतीयः सर्वाथ० मौनमभजत the third had recourse to silence, the means of acquiring all objects.

70. Wise men should not give a daugher in marriage to those who live at a (great) distance, who are devoted to duties leading to absolution, who are (recklessly) brave and who are penniless. 
71. By a man desiring a happy result his daughter should not be given to a bridegroom who is not liked by her though he be endowed with beauty.

This is taken from Bhar. Vair. Sa't, Mis. 38, where the reading for श्वेतं पदं is वर्णे सितम्. It was customary in ancient times to mark the wells set apart for the use of, or owned by, Chandalas to suspend a bone over them, that they might easily be recognised. 
75. (In old age) the limbs are shrivelled, the gait falters, the teeth fall off, the eye-sight quivers (becomes unsteady), beauty itself wanes, the mouth dribbles caliys,

the relatives do not at all obey orders (or act up to one's words), and the wife does not wait upon (or serve her husband): alas, oh pity! a man decrepit with (or broken down by) old age is despised even by his own sons!

well enjoyable is obtained without any manly effort? Even an old bull eats grass obtained luckily (readily found, . 6. without any effort on his part).

TANTRA V. 
-Describing or having for its theme 
one who did a rash or inconsiderate deed. 
1. A man should not act upon what he has imperfectly seen or known or heard or examined, as was done by a barber (as related) in the following story. 
qafo-is the old name of Patna, the ancient capital of Magadha or Bihar. If the same town is meant, the author must have put it in through inadvertence, as it is situated in northern India. Perhaps he meant Mahilàropya, which was a southern city, but forgot to mention it, as he has done else where; see II. p. 1. io-while discharging duties relating to religion, the acquisition of wealth (4) and the satisfaction of desire (conjugal happiness or the enjoy- ment of worldly pleasures).

2. Character, purity of conduct (or integrity of purpose) forbearance, politeness, amiableness, and high birth-these do not appear to advatage when a person is without wealth (poor). 
3. Self respect, vanity, worldly knowledge, grace, and beneficence-all these vanish simultaneously when a man is reduced to penury. 
4. याति वयं- goes on diminishing. आहता-strack or blown off. fafo-the beauty of winter. -maintenance,

6. Like the sky from which the stars have vanished or like a lake that has got dry or like the cemetery that presents a horrid view, the house of a poor man looks ghastly (or ugly) although (originally) of charming aspect. 
7. Men destitute of wealth being (thus) dwarfed down are not noticed although dwelling before (the eyes of rich men) like bubbles that constantly vanish the moment they appear on the surface of water. -may also be taken with fana who are always treated as dead although born (living). 
8. Leaving a man who is high born, accomplished and of good disposition (when poor), the multitudes of people attach themselves to a rich man, as though he were a wish-granting tree, although destitute of noble birth, skill and character, कुलकुशल--here कुशल is used like a 
nour. 
477 
P. 229. 9. The merit arising from actions done in a previous life is fruitless in this world, since even men endowed with learning and born in a noble family become the slaves of (serve) any person who has wealth at the particular time. Or may better be taken to mean the previous good deeds or past favours of a man (since even learned men forsake such a man when poor and serve him who has wealth &c.) 
10. People do not say-this ocean is light-hearted, although it keeps roaring as it pleases: all that the opulent do is far from being shameful in this world (or, does not reflect or cast any shame on them).

-The dream might prove to be false or ineffective. 
11. The dream seen by a person who is diseased or afflicted with grief or stricken with anxiety or overwhelmed with the pangs 
of love or intoxicated turns out false. -'It is not clear what this practice was. How- ever, it appears that the custom of calling barbers to wash the feet and do other menial works did prevail among the Buddhist and Jainas before." Gudbole,

-having knelt down (in veneration). 
having covered (lit. placed on the opening of) his mouth with the end of his upper garment (that the saliva from his mouth should not fall out). 
12, Victorious are (all homage to) those Buddha ascetics who are distinguished by the highest knowledge (which leads to salvation), whose minds have been, from their (very) birth, the salt (barren) ground for the produc- tion of the feelings of love. --the pres. indicative is used, instead of the Imper. when inferiors express a wish for the welfare of superiors or persons in a higher station, -p. p. of the denom, from which means salt, 
unproductive, soil. 
P. 230. 13. That is a tongue (others are merely lumps of flesh) which praises Jina; &c. -devoted to (finds pleasure in). Those hands alone are praiseworthy which offer worship to him. in may also be taken (by लिंगवचनविपरिणाम ) with (जका and चित्त; सा जिह्वा श्लाघ्या, तश्चित्तं काव्यं &c.

14. What woman are you thinking of under (lit. having recourse to) the pretext of meditation? Open your eyes a moment and look at these persons wounded by the shafts of the bodiless one ( god of love): although able to protect, you protect us not. Vainly are you mer- ciful (you only pretend to be merciful ); who else can be more cruel than you? May Buddha Jina, who was thus vehemently addressed by love-stricken women, pro- tect you! 
This is the opening Sl. of the Nàgánanda-a play by S'rt Harsha ध्यानमेव व्याजः a pretext तम्. आतुर - afflicted with. -lit. the slayer, is a name of Cupid or the god

or the instruments of Mara, sit before Jina and try to seduce him but in vain. 
-the chief of the Kshapanakas, o-who got the blessing-May your religious faith prosper'. The usual form of a blessing given by a Bud. ascetic is धर्मों वर्धतां or धर्मवृद्धिर्भवतु सुख - who was given insruction in Vows leading to the attainment of uninterrupted or con- tinued (lit, a series of) happiness, fio-who had a knot tied to his upper garment (probably in recognition of the favours received). -respectfully faguro-going out for alms, -lit: a reverent hearer; a term of address generally applied to Jaina, and sometimes to a Buddha, layman (see Mudra'iâ. p. 111. ).

P. 231. 16. As a man grows old his hair gets old (wears away); so do his teeth (i. e. decay) and his eyes and ears (i. e. they lose their power of seeing and hearing); his desire only gets strong (lit. youthful).

18. Nothing should be done without being properly examined; it should be done after careful investigation; else it would lead to repentance afterwards, as in the case of a Brahmana's wife with regard to an ichneumon,

19. Even a bad son who is ill-bred, ugly, foolish and vicious gives delight to the hearts of men. 
P. 232. 20. -it is said. go-but the touch of a son's body excels that of rubbed sandal (in its cool- ness-gladdening influence). 
21. People do not desire (long for") so much the bond of affection of a brother, a father, a well-wisher or a pro- tector as they do of a son,

• भितप्ता - afflicted with. प्रलपति - addressed him these dole- ful words. Ho-greedy-natured. of-over powered by.

J 
23. Better.is a residence in a forest inhabited by tigers elephants, and other beasts, void of water and full of thorny shrubs, as also a grassy bed and a bark garment for clothing, than a life of poverty among one's relatives. 
P. 233. 24. The master, though well served, dislikes those men who have no wealth; (even) gocd relatives leave them all at once; their merits do not shine forth, their sons forsake them; their difficulties multifly; their wives, though born of noble families, do not serve them well ( i.e., as they ought to do), and their friends whose valour is based on justice, desert them. साधुसुव० -- Read साधु सुवं०. न्याया० e. whose exertions are guided by the consideration of what is right and who, therefore, may be expected to be of service to them. 
25. Let a man be brave, good looking, amiable and eloquent; let him be an expert in the use of weapons and well-versed in the S'âstras; he does not at all get fame and respect in this world of mortals. T should not be taken here in the sense of fortunate or lucky, as he can not then be poor, 
26. His senses with their powers unimpaired are the same, his name the same, his acute (lit. not obstructed any where) intellect the same, his speech the same, and the man too the same; but when without the warmth of482 
wealth, he becomes in a moment one to be avoided: this is strange. See Bhartrih. Nit, Sat. 40. 
27. In this world a man whose mind is perplexed with anxiety disregards truth, leaves off the multitude of his relations and abandoning even his mother and leaving his birth-place, quickly repairs to a foregin land, the people whereof he likes (desires to associate with ). 
-The river on the bank of which Ujjain stands, the modern Betwa. -name of the celebrated Linga of Sivu at Ujjain, one of the 12 Jyotirlingas and often referred to by Kálidasa; see Rag. VI. 34; Meghaduta 30-38. The twelve Jyotirlingas are thus mentioned in the S'iva Parana-सौराष्ट्रे सोमनाथं च श्रीशैले मल्लिकार्जुनम् । उज्जयिन्यां महाकाल- मोंकारपरमेश्वरम् (ओंकारममरेश्वरं, ओंकारं च महेश्वरे इ. पा.) ॥ केदारं हिमवत्पृष्ठे डाकिन्यां ( भीमायां ) भीमशंकरम् । वाराणस्यां च विश्वेशं त्र्यंबकं गौतमीतटे वैद्यनाथं चिताभूमौ (परली इति प्रतिद्धपुरे) नागेशं दारुकावने । सेतुबन्धे च रामेश घुश्मेशं (घृणेशं इ. पा ) च शिवालये (वेरुळ इति ख्याते) ॥ ( एतेषां दर्शनादेव पातकं नैव तिष्ठति । ) ० विधिना संभाव्य - having honoured him in the form proper for a Brahmana. fa-Pilgrims wander- ing about to gain Siddhi (superhuman power obtained by magic and such other means enabling one to gain one's object). or fara may simply mean-to gain our object. 
11 
28. Coveted things of varions sorts and difficult to obtain are gained by means of the bodies of adventurous men which rise quite equal to the occasion. (That is adventurous persons who run any risk regardless of the safety of their bodies gain their object ). 
29. Water sometimes falls from the sky; it also comes (flows) from the lower region (the bowels of the earth) into an excavation (a well, a tank &c.) (i. e. man gets it without an effort and also with an effort by digging a well &c.); so fate, though powerful, should be disregarded (lit. should not be considered); manly effort too, is, indeed, powerful. The first half may also be translated as-A man sometimes falls 
483 
from the sky (i. e. some height) into a ditch (owing to the working of fate); but he also rises to the surface of water from the lowest abyss (as the result of his own exertion). 
P. 234. 30. Every desired object of a man is accom- plished, without exception, by means of manly exertion; and even what you call fate is (the result of) human exer- tion called Adṛshta. (the invisible one) i. e. the sum of his good or bad actions (44) done in a previous life which exerts a secret influence over and predetermines the various conditions of his present life, and which is regarded as a quality of the soul, 
31. Adventurous people count as light as straw, and it is to their credit, the extraordinary fear coming from powerful (or elderly) persons, as also their lives:- wonderful is this line of action followed by the generous-minded. एतद् &०. एतद् उदाराणामुदारैः चरितमाचरितं चरितमद्भु० १०. 
32. Without subjecting the body to pain or hard- labour (i. e. it one is not prepared to expose one's body to hardships) happiness of different kinds is not obtained in this world. The slayer of Madhu (Vishnu, even) embraces Lakshmi with arms fatigued by the churning of the ocean (i. e, even Vishnu did not obtain Lakshmi by easy means). Lakshmi was one of the 14 jewels obtained from the milky ocean when churned by the gods and the demons. See Bhág. Pu. VIII. 8.8-23. Mah. Bhar. I. 18, 19. 
33. How can (Lakshmi), the wife of that Vishnu, though appearing in the terrible form of the man-lion, not be unsteady, when he, lying on water, enjoys sleep for four months. Here the fickleness of Lakshmi is humourously attributed to Vishnu's inactivity. Vishnu is supposed to sleep in the milky ocean, reclined on the body of Sesha, for four months, from the 11th of the bright half of A'shádha to the 11th of the bright half of Kártika, 
34. So long as a man does not put forth manly 
484 
exertions, supreme excelleuce (great fortune) is not to be obtained: even the sun, in this world, succeeds in dispelling the clouds when he enters the zodiacal sign libra (proves by his might to be equal to his enemies, the clouds). The sun does not attain brightness until he displays his valour; so a man does not attain prosperity without exploit. Some take to mean-the property or portion of the enemy, but this is far-fetched. It also ill suits the second line. The sun does not acquire any property of the clouds but gains supreme brightness by his victory. 
faat-A cavern. शाकिनीसाधन - Propitiating a शाकिनी (a particular female demon). श्मशाo-resorting to the charnel ground for attaining miraculous power by means of spells &c. Erie-selling human flesh (see Mál, Mad V.) and the flesh of such higher animals as horse &c. as the S'àktas offer to their Devi. -

P. 237. 38. This is mine, this is a stranger-such is the reckoning (consideration) of the little-minded, To the generous-minded the world itself is their family (ie., they regard the whole world as.)

P. 238. 40. He is a (true) relative (or friend) who stands by (assists) one when there is a festival, in difficulty, when there is a famine, when there is a calamity arising from an enemy, at the royal court, &c. The Pandit took fagfa in the literal sense of-one who stands in a cemetery &c. -clang to. &c.-The motion of Dharma is quick (as wrongly interpreted by the Pandit ). The real meaning is A religious duty should be done at once (i. e. the moment one thinks of it). The whole sl. stands thus - णं चित्तं क्षणं वित्तं क्षणं जीवति मानवः । यमस्य करुणा नास्ति धर्मस्य ......॥ इष्टं &c. one should unite Dharma with a desired thing. The proper sense is-one should give a desired thing (and not a worthless one) as a religious gift.

Thns ends the fifth Tantra. Here we should naturally of expect some reference to the king at whose instance Vi- shnus'arman made the compitalion for the instruction his sons or to the princes the.nselves as in the Hitopades's. Wilson, however, thus gives the concluding portion as found in the copies consulted by him. 
Vishnus'armá, having thus terminated these narratives, asked the princes, what more it was necessary for him to say. The princes replied-Most worthy preceptor, we have learnt from you all that is essential to the duties of a king. Then we have only to wish, answered Vishnu- s'armà, that this S'ástra may be considered as a mirror, reflecting light friendly to other sciences, and facilitating- to those, who are acquainted with its contents, the acquir- ment of workdly wisdom. 
When the king found his sons were instructed in this manner, in the course of six months, in the substance of all the Sástras, he was highly delighted with their im provement, and acknowledging that the sage had fulfilled his promise, loaded him with unprecedented wealth and favours.
