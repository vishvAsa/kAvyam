There is not that kind of knowledge, gift &c. which is not sung (eulogised) of (as possessed by) the wealthy by supplicants: i. e. they attribute every kind of knowledge &c. to rich men (although they may not possess these ). Cf. यस्यास्ति वित्तं स नरः कुलीनः &c. 
5-(even a stranger) acts as a relative to- wards (the rich). ara-Acts wickedly towards (does not hesitate to offend or do injury to). 
6 All actions proceed (are properly accomplished) from wealth, increased and then well amassed (by proper ma- nagement) as do rivers from mountains when (sufficiently) high and well sloping. 
7 That a man not deserving of respect is respected, or one not fit to be approacshed is approached, or that one who ought not (lit. does not deserve) to be saluted is salu- ted, is (all due to) the power of wealth. 
8 Like (the vigour of) the organs of sense on eating, 
262 
all actions (business of every kind) depend on wealth: for this reason wealth is said to be the means of accom- plishing every thing. 
9 This world of mortals seeking (hankering after), wealth, resorts even to a cemetery (has recourse to even despicable or horrible means); and leaving one's father even goes far (to distant climes.)

11. Begging is practised by the low i. e. is consider- ed as a mean (dishonourable) profession; and alas ! a king does not reward (service) adequately; husbandry entails a great deal of labour (or is fraught with dangers) (with the reading 4-stands in danger of being ruined by want of rain); the acquistition of knowledge is exceeding- ly difficult owing to a behaviour of humility towards a Gura (:ff: v. 1.-the act of attending on a Guru, is beset with great difficulties (and thus the ac- quistion of knowledge is not an easy task); from (if one were to practice) usury poverty (sometimes) results owing to the loss of the purse transferred to the hands of (the money lent to) others; (since all these professions have something or another to be found fault with) I think there is no mode of earning one's livelihood superior to (or, no profession is better than) trading. 
P. 5. 12. Of all the means (of acquiring wealth) the storing up of merchandise is the best (or, is the only one so called); for that alone is the best (lit. commended) for 
263 
the production of wealth; any other than that is of a doubtful nature (uncertain as to its result). ex f of seven kinds. गान्धिक - गन्धः पण्यभस्य a vendor of perfumes व्यवहारः - dealing in perfumes or fragrant wares निक्षेप-

13 Of all articles of sale, perfumery is the best; what is the good of commodities like gold and others! since in the former case what is bought for one is sold for a hun- dred. 
14 When a deposit is made in the house the merchant (receiving it) prays to his (favourite) deity saying-If the depositor dies (would die ) I will make you the proferred present. is a present promised to a deity for the fulfilment of a desired object. What is meant is-It is not a safe course to deposit money with a merchant for interest, 
15 A man entrusted with a Company's business thinks, delighted at heart-I have to-day obtained the whole earth full of wealth; why want any other thing. 
16 A shopkeeper, eagerly looking at a customer ac- quainted with him coming, rejoices at the prospeet of getting his money as a man does on the birth of a son. 
17 Always cheating persons of one's acquaintance by measures imperfectly filled up as also by telling false prices is the natural (peculiar) duty (course of conduct) of the Kiràtas. The Kirs'tas are a degraded wild tribe living

186. All the craft (or the code of stratagems), that was known to Us'anas (Sukracharya, the preceptor of the demons) and to Brhaspati, cannot be placed above (can- not surpass) that known to the talent of women; how can they be kept under control (or within proper bounds)? 187. Those who represent untruth as truth and vice versa, how can they be guarded by wise men? 
188. One should not get excessively attached to women nor wish their power (over one) to grow i. e. allow them to gain asendency over oneself. For with men dotingly fond of them they play as with crows shorn of their wings.

191. By whom is this machine in the form of woman, resembling poison mixed with nectar, created in this world. for the destruction of virtue ? It is a whirlpool of risks, an abode of acts of immodesty, the residence of adventurous deeds or enterprises, the meeting place of faults, a dwelling for hundreds of frauds, the birth-place (lit. field) of mis- trusts, which is difficult to be comprehended even by able and eminent men (the choicest of the chosen) and which is the repository (lit. a box for) all kinds of deceitful tricks.

Unsteady by nature like a wave of the sea, and displaying Rága (love, a red tinge) for a short space of time like a line of evening clouds, women (courtesans) who have gained their object (or made their fortune) abandon a man who has lost his wealth like red lac that has been squeezed. चलखभावा – स्वभावचला.

When a planet passes through the cart of Rohini there is want of rain followed by a terrible famine. The earth, not yielding corn, causes the death of creatures and thus commits sin, It becomes parched and arid and is covered with the ashes and bones of the persons that die in consequence of the drought. In this condition it is described as practising the vow of the Kápàlikas who also, to atone for their sins, go about naked, with their limbs covered with ashes and a human skull in the hand for collecting alms.

A Rasayana must be taken in very small doses, otherwise it will do harm, gf-(1) prosperity; (2) nourishment. What the sl. purports to say is this-A king should not seek to enrich his treasury all at once but should draw as much money from his subjects as he can do with safety and that too by gentle means. The meaning of the sl, is made clear in the following slokas. 
219. Land (a kingdom), though unproductive, yields fruit (a good revenue) when pressed for payment by con- stitutional means as the arant, though rough, gives rise to fire when churned in due form and with the recitation of the Vedic verses. fafa in the first case means-the course prescribed by state policy, the method of government. मन्त्र - counsel, the advice of ministers; hence निधिना मन्त्र० means-by constitutional methods. -chured for (re venue) i.e. mode to pay taxes &c. at may have the sense 
303 
of being roughly handled. When a king governs his coun- try according to the dictates of policy and the advice of his ministers people pay the taxes levied although the tax- ation may weigh heavy upon them at times. 
220. The protection of subjects conduces to glory and swells the treasure in the form of heaven (i. e. the obtain- ment of becomes surer and surer every day &c.), but their oppression assuredly leads (fa) to the destruction of religious merit and to sin and infamy. 
221. The king-cowherd should take the milk in the shape of wealth of the cow of subjects gradually protecting and nourishing her (at the same time ); and he should follow a course (policy) of justice. 
222. A king, who, through a wrong sense of his king- ly power, destroys his subjects like a goat, will enjoy plea- sure but once and not a second time at all. 
223. A king desirous of benefit (revenue) should, with special efforts, look after the growth of his subjects with the water of gifts and honour (should take care to see that his subjects are in a prosperous condition and kept well pleased with the bestowal of gifts and honours) just as a gardener, wishing for fruit, tends the young saplings with special care by pruning (a) them, by keeping them in good order (H) and by suppling them with water. 
224. A king acting the part of a lamp, although draw- ing up oil in the shape of wealth from his subjects is not observed to do so by any one by reason of his intrinsic bright qualities. 
Herein a good king is compared with a lamp. Just as a lamp gradually sucking up oil by its wicks is not observed to do so (nobody minds the consumption of oil) owing to the bright light it gives, so a king, with shining good qualities, although taking money from his subjects is not observed to do so by his subjects owing to the blessings derived from his rule, 
304 
225. Just as a cow is reared up and milked in time so are subjects taken care of and made to give to the king his due. When a creeper is watered and (thus) grows luxuriant- ly it yields flowers and fruits. The meaning is that a king wishing to have a large revenue must attend to the general prosperity and well being of his subjects. 
226. Just as the minute germ of a seed when nouri- shed with care yields fruit in time so do subjects when well protected. 
227. Gold, vehicles of various kinds and other things of that sort, a king obtains from his subjects. 
228. Kings who bestow favours on the people prosper, while they meet with destruction if the people are destroyed; there is no doubt as to this.

P. 57. 271. Those who have called servitude 'a canine mode of life' have wrongly said so; for a dog acts according to his will (pleasure) in this world, while a servant acts according to the direction of his master (a dog has a free or independent course of action; a ser- vant has not). 
272. Sleeping on the ground (lit. the ground serving as a bed agar), observance of celibacy, getting lean and eating lightly (scanty food) or quickly-these a servant does like an ascetic: the difference is that made by sin and merit (in one case they lead to sin in the other to religions merit).

287. Of servants who are attached (to their master) and obliging (always attending to the good of their master) who devote themselves to pursuits, calculated to do good to others, who know the principle of faithful service and who are far from being treacherous (to their lord), destru- ction is certain when they commit faults; as to success in their object (credit for their work) they may or may not get it; therefore, service of the lord of the earth, as of the lord of waters (taking to royal service as to a sea-faring life) is always attended with danger or uncertainty. 
288. Supply at: after . In this world even a service (a favour conferred) by some, loving through real affection, is looked upon with displeasure, while direct injury done by others, serves to give pleasuse. So on account of the difficulty of properly guaging (understanding) the nature of) the minds of kings which are the receptacte of a variety of feelings, the duties of servitude prove to be extremely intricate being beyond the grasp of even Yoging (men who have obtained superhuman powers).

They are truly called ministers who, well versed in politics, settle by the power of their intellect, by peace- ful means alone, affairs which else would lead to the risky course (a) of adopting violent measures (0) and which can be accomplished with great trouble; while the sovereignty of a king is placed in a balance (i. e. in a state of uncertainty-is endangered) by the impolitic acts of those who desire by forcible measures and wrong policy to attain results that bring in unsubstantial and scanty benefit.

Suppose the king does not die and Sanj. also is not killed; but this cannot be, Sanj. will die &c.
