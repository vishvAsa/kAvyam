in
The Pañcatantra is a famous literary work of Viṣṇuśarman, the Court-Pandit of King Amarasakti of Mahilaropya in the south. Originally it was intended by the author to educate the princes of his patron the science of politics and practical life. The work comprises five Tantras, consisting of stories inter- spersed with verses which are full of political maxims applicable to exigencies of life. The present edition contains, besides the text, copious notes and literal translation in English. A short Sanskrit Commentary, explaining difficult compounds and grammatical formation of words has also been added. The edition contains some additional verses and different readings found in some manuscripts. Any student who has acquired a preliminary knowledge of Sanskrit grammar will understand the text with the help of notes and translation without any difficulty.
