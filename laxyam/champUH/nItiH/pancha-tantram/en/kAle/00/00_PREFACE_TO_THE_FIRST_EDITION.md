title = "00 PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION"

+++
The present edition is meant for such of the students as have not the means of securing private assistance....A full English translation has been given of all difficult verses. But in the case of easier ones, the translation stops after giving a rendering of the unintelligible parts only. The same has been done with regard to the difficult prose passages. Thus there is scope left for the boys to exercise their own brain power. A short commentary explaining all difficult compounds and giving the prose order of difficult verses has been added. In the case of intricate passages I have added, sometimes a word, at others, a sentence or two to make the sense clear. The exigencies of space, however, did not permit me to add full explanations. But what is given is sufficient to make the text intelligible to a student of ordinary under- standing. A special feature of the present edition is this-that it gives different readings and some additional verses found in two MSS consulted by me. 

The student will observe that the reflections and citations which are so profusely interspersed in the first three Tantras become much less copious in the last two-a circumstance which, however, much adds to the interest, if not to the utility, of the compilation.
