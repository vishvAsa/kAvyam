There was once a king named Gay-Chariot in a certain place. He owned a lake named Lotus Lake, which his soldiers guarded carefully. For many golden swans lived there, and they gave one tail-feather apiece every six months.

Having listened to this proposal, the king asked Fierce-Eye: “My worthy sir, what is your opinion?” And Fierce-Eye said: “O King, his advice is heartless. For one does not kill a suppliant. No doubt you have heard the old story:

The dove \(there mentioned\) entertained

His suppliant foeman slaughter stained;

Paid honor due, his guest to greet;

And sacrificed himself for meat.”

“How was that?” asked Foe-Crusher. And Fierce-Eye told the story of
