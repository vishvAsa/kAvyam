title = "10 THE BRAHMAN, THE THIEF, AND THE GHOST"

+++

There was once a poor Brahman in a certain place. He lived on presents, and always did without such luxuries as fine clothes and ointments and perfumes and garlands and gems and betel-gum. His beard and his nails were long, and so was the hair that covered his head and his body. Heat, cold, rain, and the like had dried him up.

Then someone pitied him and gave him two calves. And the Brahman began when they were little and fed them on butter and oil and fodder and other things that he begged. So he made them very plump.

Then a thief saw them and the idea came to him at once: “I will steal these two cows from this Brahman.” So he took a rope and set out at night. But on the way he met a fellow with a row of sharp teeth set far apart, with a high-bridged nose and uneven eyes, with limbs covered with knotty muscles, with hollow cheeks, with beard and body as yellow as a fire with much butter in it.

And when the thief saw him, he started with acute fear and said: “Who are you, sir?”

The other said: “I am a ghost, named Truthful. It is now your turn to explain yourself.”

The thief said: “I am a thief, and my acts are cruel. I am on my way to steal two cows from a poor Brahman.”

Then the ghost felt relieved and said: “My dear sir, I take one meal every three days. So I will just eat this Brahman today. It is delightful that you and I are on the same errand.”

So together they went there and hid, waiting for the proper moment. And when the Brahman went to sleep, the ghost started forward to eat him. But the thief saw him said: “My dear sir. this is not right. You are not to eat the Brahman until I have stolen his two cows.”

The ghost said: “The racket would most likely wake the Brahman. In that case all my trouble would be vain.”

“But. on the other hand.” said the thief, “if any hindrance arises when you start to eat him, then I cannot steal the two cows either. First I will steal the two cows. then you may eat the Brahman.”

So they disputed each crying “Me first\! Me first\!” And when they became heated, the hubbub waked the Brahman. Then the thief said: “Brahman, this is a ghost who wishes to eat you.” And the ghost said: “Brahman, this is a thief who wishes to steal your two cows.”

When the Brahman heard this. he stood up and took a good look. And by remembering a prayer to his favorite god. he saved his life from the ghost, then lifted a club and saved his two cows from the thief.

“And that is why I say:

From enemies expect relief.… .

and the rest of it. Besides:

The Scriptures tell a holy tale

Of sacrificial love.

How Shibi gave the hawk his flesh

As ransom lor the dove

showing that it is contrary to religion to slay a suppliant.”

Having listened to this opinion, the king asked Wall-Ear: “What is your view, sir? Tell me.” And Wall-Far said: “O king. he certainly should not be killed. For if you spare his life, you two may well grow fond of each other, and spend the time pleasantly. There is a saying:

Be quick with mutual defense

In honest give-and-take:

Or perish. like the ant-hill beast

And like the belly-snake.”

‘’How was that?” asked Foe-Crusher. And Wall-Ear told the story of
