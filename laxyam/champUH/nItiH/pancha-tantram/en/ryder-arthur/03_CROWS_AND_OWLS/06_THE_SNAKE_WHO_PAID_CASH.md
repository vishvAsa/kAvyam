There was once a Brahman in a certain place. His time was wholly spent in unproductive farming.

Now one day, toward the end of summer, the heat was too much for him, and he dozed in the shade of a tree in the middle of his field.

And the relatives cremated him on a woodpile near the field.

On the second day the father returned. And learning from his relatives the cause of his son’s death, he found the facts as stated.
