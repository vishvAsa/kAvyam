title = "04 THE BRAHMAN’S GOAT"

+++

In a certain town lived a Brahman named Friendly who had undertaken the labor of maintaining the sacred fire. One day in the month of February, when a gentle breeze was blowing, when the sky was veiled in clouds and a drizzling rain was falling, he went to another village to beg a victim for the sacrifice, and said to a certain man: “O sacrificer, I wish to make an offering on the approaching day of the new moon. Pray give me a victim.” And the man gave him a plump goat, as prescribed in Scripture. This he put through its paces, found it sound, placed it on his shoulder, and started in haste for his own city.

Now on the road he was met by three rogues whose throats were pinched with hunger. These, spying the plump creature on his shoulder, whispered together: “Come now\! If we could eat that creature, we should have the laugh on this sleety weather. Let us fool him, get the goat, and ward off the cold.”

So the first of them changed his dress, issued from a by-path to meet the Brahman, and thus addressed that man of pious life: “O pious Brahman, why are you doing a thing so unconventional and so ridiculous? You are carrying an unclean animal, a dog, on your shoulder. Are you ignorant of the verse:

The dog and the rooster,

The hangman, the ass,

The camel, defile you:

Don’t touch them, but pass.”

At that the Brahman was mastered by anger, and he said: “Are you blind, man, that you impute doghood to a goat?” “O Brahman,” said the rogue, “do not be angry. Go whither you will.”

But when he had traveled a little further, the second rogue met him and said: “Alas, holy sir, alas\! Even if this dead calf was a pet, still you should not put it on your shoulder. For the proverb says:

Touch not unwisely man or beast

That lifeless lie;

Else, gifts of milk and lunar fast

Must purify.”

Then the Brahman spoke in anger: “Are you blind, man? You call a goat a calf.” And the rogue said: “Holy sir, do not be angry. I spoke in ignorance. Do as you will.”

But when he had walked only a little farther through the forest, the third rogue, changing his dress, met him and said: “Sir, this is most improper. You are carrying a donkey on your shoulder. Yet the proverb tells you:

If you should touch an ass — be it

In ignorance or not —

You needs must wash your clothes and bathe,

To cleanse the sinful spot.

Pray drop this thing, before another sees you.”

So the Brahman concluded that it was a goblin in quadruped form, threw it on the ground, and made for home, terrified. Meanwhile, the three rogues met, caught the goat, and carried out their plan.

“And that is why I say:

The strong, deft, clever rascals note,….

and’the rest of it.

“Moreover, there is sound sense in this:,

Is any man uncheated by

New servants’ diligence,

The praise of guests, the maidens’ tears,

And roguish eloquence?

Furthermore, one should avoid a quarrel with a crowd, though the individuals be weak. As the verse puts it:

Beware the populace enraged;

A crowd’s a fearsome thing:

The ants devoured the giant snake

For all his quivering.”

“How was that?” asked Cloudy. And Live-Strong told the story of
