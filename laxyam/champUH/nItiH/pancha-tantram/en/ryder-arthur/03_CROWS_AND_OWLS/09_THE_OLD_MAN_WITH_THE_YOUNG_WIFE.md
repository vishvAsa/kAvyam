title = "09 THE OLD MAN WITH THE YOUNG WIFE"

+++

There was once an aged merchant in a certain town, and his name was Lovelorn. To such an extent had love clouded his reason that, when his wife died, he gave much money in order to marry the daughter of a penniless shopkeeper. But the girl was heartbroken and could not bear to look at the old merchant. This, indeed, might have been anticipated.

The silvered head will sue in vain,

A maiden’s love beseeching;

The maid, despising it, is fain

I’ll return if she does not

Passionately cling.”

“Thus advantage may be anticipated from a benefactor, thief though he be. How much more from a suppliant guest? Besides, having been maltreated by them, he will labor for our success, or for the revelation of their vulnerable point. In view of this, he should not be killed.”

Having listened to this view, Foe-Crusher questioned another counselor, namely, Hook-Nose. “My worthy sir, what should be done under the present circumstances?” And Hook-Nose answered: “O King, he should not be killed, For

From enemies expect relief.

If discord pierce their host;

Thus, life was given by the thief

And cattle by the ghost.”

“How was that?” asked Foe-Crusher.” And Hook-Nose told the story of
