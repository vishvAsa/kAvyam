title = "01 HOW THE BIRDS PICKED A KING"

+++

Once upon a time the bird-clans gathered for consultation. There were swans and cranes and nightingales; there were peacocks, plovers, and owls; there were doves and pigeons and partridges; there were bluejays, vultures, skylarks; there were demoiselles and cuckoos and woodpeckers and many others.

And they said: “We have in Garuda a king, to be sure. But he is ever intent on serving holy Vishnu, and pays no heed to us. What is the good of a sham king? He does not defend us when we are in genuine distress — when we are caught in traps, for instance. There is a saying:

Only one, but anyone

Is my king, when all is done —

Only one who will restore

Health and joy I felt before:

Anyone, but only one—

For the moon a single sun.

“Any other is king only in name. As the poet says:

Let him calm the panting breath

Of his people, quivering

Under blows; or he is Death

Masquerading as a king.

And again:

These six should every man avoid

Like leaky ships at sea—

A dull professor; and a priest

Without theology;

A king who does not give defense;

A wife whose tongue can slash;

A cowboy hankering for town;

A barber after cash.

We must therefore pitch upon someone else as king of the birds.”

Thereupon, observing that the owl had a venerable appearance, they all said: “Let this owl be our king. And let a plentiful supply be provided of all substances prescribed for the anointing of a king.”

Straightway water was brought from various holy streams; a bouquet of one hundred and eight roots was provided, including the one marked with a wheel and the yellow-stemmed lotus; and the lion-throne was set in place. Moreover, there was drawn on the ground a relief map of the seven continents, oceans, and mountains. A tiger-skin was spread. Golden jars were filled with five twigs, blossoms and grains; oblations were prepared; the most eminent bards chanted poetry. Furthermore Brahmans, skilled in reciting the four Vedas, also chanted, while maidens sang songs, sweet holiday songs being their specialty. In the forefront was prepared a vessel of consecrated rice set off with white mustard, parched grain, rice-grains, yellow pigment, wreaths of flowers, conch-shells, and so forth. The materials for lustration ceremonies were provided, and holiday drums rumbled. In the midst of a consecrated spot strewn with potash stood the lion-throne, adorned by the person of the owl as he waited the anointing.

At that moment a crow came into the assembly from nobody knew where, announcing his entrance with a raucous caw. And he thought: “Well, well\! what means this gathering of all birds, and this great festival?”

But when the birds saw him, they whispered together: “He is the shrewdest of the birds, they say. So let us have a speech from him, too. For the proverb says:.

Of men, the barber smartest is;

The jackal, of the beasts;

The crow is cleverest of birds;

The White-Robe, of the priests.

And besides:

Concerted counsels of the wise,

If heedfully thought through,

Will never founder, being sound

From every point of view.”

So the birds said to the crow: “You know, the birds have no king. They have therefore decided unanimously to anoint this owl as their supreme monarch. Please express your opinion also. You come in the nick of time.”

Then the crow laughed and said: “Gentlemen, this is foolish. When you have eminent swans, peacocks, nightingales, partridges, sheldrakes, pigeons, cranes, and others, why anoint this ugly-faced fellow who is blind in the day-time? It seems wrong to me. For

Big hooked nose and eyes asquint,

Ugly face without a hint

Of tenderness or beauty in ‘t.

Good-natured, it is fierce to see;

If he were mad, what might it be?

And furthermore:

Ugly, cruel, full of spleen,

Every word he speaks is mean;

If you make the owl your king,

You will fail in everything.

Besides, when Garuda is your king, what is this fellow good for? Suppose he has virtue, still a second king is not a good idea when you already have one. For the saying runs:

A single king of lordly sway

Is good; but more than one will slay,

Like plural suns on Judgment Day.

Why, the very name of your genuine king keeps others from taking liberties. As the proverb puts it:

Mere mention of a lordly monarch’s name

To mean men, straightway saves from loss and shame.

And there is a saying:

The feigning of a great commission

Immensely betters your condition:

Feigning a message from the moon,

The rabbits dwelt in comfort soon.”

“How was that?” asked the birds. And the crow told
