title = "02 HANDSOME AND THEODORE"

+++

There was once a frog-king in a well, and his name was Theodore. One day when tormented by his relatives, he climbed from bucket to bucket up the water-wheel, and finally emerged. Then he thought: “How can I pay those relatives back? For the proverb says:

While one brings comfort in distress,

Another jeers at pain;

By paying both as they deserve,

A man is born again.”

With this in mind, he saw a black snake named Handsome crawling out of his hole. And on seeing him, he thought once more: “I will invite that black snake into the well, and clean out all my relatives. For the saying goes:

A sliver draws a sliver out;

Just so the wise employ

Grim foes to slaughter foes; and thus

Turn danger into joy.”

Having come to this conclusion, he went to the mouth of the hole and called: “Come out\! Come out, Handsome\! Come out\!” But when the snake heard this, he thought: “Whoever he may be that is calling me, he does not belong to my race. That is no snake’s voice. And I have no alliance with anyone else in the living world. So I will just stay here until I am sure who he may be. For the proverb says:

Until you have full information

Of prowess, character, and station,

To no man let your trust be given—

Such is the current saw in heaven.

Perhaps it is some conjurer or druggist who is calling me in order to put me in a cage. Or a man who bears a grudge and summons me in the interest of his friend.”

So he said: “Who are you?” The other said: “I am a frog-king named Theodore, and I have come to make friends with you.”

When the snake heard this, he said: “Why, it is incredible. Does grass make friends with fire? You know the proverb:

You do not, even in a dream,

Approach the kind of foe

Who kills at sight. What can you mean?

Why should you babble so?”

But Theodore said: “You are quite right, sir. You are my born enemy. And yet I come to you because I have been insulted. You know well:

When all your property is gone

And life itself at stake —

To save that life and property

You grovel to a snake.”

The snake said: “Well, who insulted you?” And the frog answered: “My relatives.” “But where is your home?” asked the snake. “In a pond? or a well? or a cistern? or a tank?” “My home is in a well,” said the frog. “But,” said the snake, “I can’t get in. And if I could, there is no place for me to lie while killing your relatives. Begone. Besides, you know

Eat only what will swallow

And gratify the hollow

Within with good digestion —

Put not your health in question.

But Theodore replied: “No, sir. Come with me. I will show you an easy way into the well. And inside there is a very attractive hole at water-level. There you can lie, and you will find it child’s play to finish my relatives.”

Then the snake reflected: “Yes, I am old. Now and then, with great effort, I catch one mouse. And often I don’t. Yes, yes, the proverb is right:

When strength is ebbing, dying,

When friends are gone, and wife,

The prudent should be trying

A carpet-slippery life.”

After these reflections, he said: “Well, Theodore, if you really mean it, lead the way. We will go together.” “Friend Handsome,” said Theodore, “I will take you there by an easy way and show you the resting-place. But you must spare my family. You must not eat any except those I point out.”

“My dear fellow,” said the snake, “you and I are now friends. Have no fear. I will do nothing but what you wish.”

Then he came out of his hole, hugged the frog, and started off with him. So they came to the edge of the well, and the snake went in with the frog by way of the buckets on the water-wheel. Then Theodore settled the black snake in the hole and showed him the relatives. And he ate them all one after another. And lacking relatives, he made up to a few of the friends, and ate them, too, with much circumspection.

Then the snake said: “My dear fellow, I have disposed of your enemies. Please give me something to eat, for you brought me here.”

“But, my dear fellow,” said Theodore, “you have done what a friend should do. Pray return by way of the buckets.”

“Friend Theodore,” said Handsome, “you make a serious mistake. How can I go home? My hole was my fortress, and it is surely occupied by strangers. Here I stay, and you must give me a frog at a time, even from your own family. If not, I will eat every one.”

At this, Theodore was disturbed in spirit, and reflected: “Oh, what was I about when I brought him here? And if I deny him now, he will eat every one. Yes, the proverb is right:

Whoever fraternizes with

Too vigorous a foe,

Is eating poison, and will soon

Perceive it to be so.

“So I will give him one a day, even if it must be a friend. For they say:

Calm with a prudent, petty bribe

A foe who may desire

To seize your all. So calms the sea

Its fierce subaqueous fire.

And again:

‘Tis wise, when all is threatened,

To give a half, and guard

The other half to win one’s ends;

For total loss is hard

And yet again:

No prudent soul would lose

Much good for little use;

Prudence implies much gain

Acquired with little pain.”

So he made up his mind, and assigned a frog a day. And the snake ate this one and another, too, behind the frog-king’s back. Ah, it is too true:

As muddied garments dirty

All that you sit upon,

So, when one virtue tumbles,

The rest are quickly gone.

Now one day, while eating frogs, he ate a frog named Theodosius, the son of Theodore. And Theodore, seeing him do it, wailed with piercing shrillness. But his wife said:

“Why so shrill? You were still

While you worked your cruel will.

Hope has fled with your dead;

Who will save your hapless head?

So think out a plan of escape this very day, or else a scheme to kill him.”

Now in course of time the frogs were finished one and all; only Theodore remained. And then Handsome said: “My dear Theodore, I am hungry and all the frogs are finished. Please give me something to eat for you brought me here.”

Theodore said: “My friend, feel no anxiety on that head while I am alive. If you permit me to leave, I will persuade the frogs in other wells, and bring them all here.”

The snake said: “Well, I can’t eat you, for you are like a brother. Now if you do as you say, you will be like a father.”

So the frog planned his escape, and left the well, while Handsome waited there, impatient for his return. But after a long time Handsome said to a lizard that lived in another hole in the same well: “My dear madam, do me a small favor, since Theodore is an old friend of yours. Please go and find him in some pool or another, and take him a message from me. Tell him to return quickly, alone if need be, if no other frogs will come. I cannot live here without him. And tell him that if I hurt him, he may have all the merit I have acquired in a lifetime.”

So the lizard did as she was bid, quickly hunted Theodore out, and said: “My dear sir, your friend Handsome is waiting, waiting for your return. Please hurry back. And furthermore, in case of his doing you any harm, he pledges you the merit acquired in a lifetime. So drop all anxious thoughts, and come home.” But Theodore said:

The hungry man at nothing sticks;

The poor man has his heartless tricks;

Tell Handsome, miss, that Theodore

Will see him in the well no more.

And so he sent her back.

“So then, you rascally water-beast\! Like Theodore, I will never, never enter your home.”

When he heard this, the crocodile said: “My good friend, you are quite wrong, I beg of you to come to my house, and so wipe out my sin of ingratitude. Otherwise, I shall starve myself to death on your doorstep.”

“You fool\!” said the monkey, “shall I go there like Flop-Ear, in full sight of the danger, and let myself be killed?”

“But who was Flop-Ear?” asked the crocodile. “And how did he perish in full sight of the danger? Please tell me.” So the monkey told the story of
