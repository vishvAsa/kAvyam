title = "04 HUNDRED-WIT, THOUSAND-WIT, AND SINGLE-WIT"

+++

In a certain pond lived two fishes whose names were Hundred-Wit and Thousand-Wit. And a frog named Single-Wit made friends with them. Thus all three would for some time enjoy at the water’s edge the pleasure of conversation spiced with witticism, then would dive into the water again.

One day at sunset they were engaged in conversation, when fishermen with nets came there, who said to one another on seeing the pond: “Look\! This pond appears to contain plenty of fish, and the water seems shallow. We will return at dawn.” With this they went home.

The three friends felt this speech to be dreadful as the fall of a thunderbolt, and they took counsel together. The frog spoke first: “Hundred-Wit and Thousand-Wit, my dear friends, what should we do now: flee or stick it out?”

At this Thousand-Wit laughed and said: “My good friend., do not be frightened merely because you have heard words. An actual invasion is not to be anticipated. Yet should it take place, I will save you and myself by virtue of my wit. For I know plenty of tricks in the water.” And Hundred-Wit added: “Yes, Thousand-Wit is quite right. For

Where wind is checked, and light of day,

The wise man’s wit soon finds a way.

One cannot, because he has heard a few mere words, abandon his birthplace, the home of his ancestors. You must not go away. I will save you by virtue of my wit.”

“Well,” said the frog, “I have only a single wit, and that tells me to flee. My wife and I are going to some other body of water this very night.”

So spoke the frog and under cover of night he went to another body of water. At dawn the next day came the fish-catchers, who seemed the servants of Death, and inclosed the pond with nets. And all the fishes, turtles, frogs, crabs, and other water-creatures were caught in the nets and captured. Even Hundred-Wit and Thousand-Wit fell into a net and were killed, though they struggled to save their lives by fancy turns.

On the following day the fishermen gleefully started home. One of them carried Hundred-Wit, who was heavy, on his head. Another carried Thousand-Wit tied to a cord. Then the frog, safe in the throat of a cistern, said to his wife: “Look, darling, look\!

While Hundred-Wit is on a head,

While Thousand-Wit hangs limp and dead,

Your humble Single-Wit, my dear,

Is padling in the water clear.”

“And that is why I say that intelligence is not the sole determinant of fate.”

Then the gold-finder said: “It may be so. Yet a friend’s advice should not be disregarded. But what happened? Spite of my dissuasion, you would not stop, such was your greed and pride in your scholarship. Yes, there is sense in the stanza:

Well sung, uncle\! Why would you

Not stop when I told you to?

What a necklace\! Yes, you wear

Music medals rich and rare.”

“How was that?” asked the wheel-bearer. And the other told the story of
