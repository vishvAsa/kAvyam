title = "11 THE FIEND WHO WASHED HIS FEET"

+++

In a certain forest lived a fiend named Cruel. One day he met a Brahman in his wanderings, climbed on his shoulder, and said: “Now go ahead’

So the terrified Brahman started off with him. But on observing that the fiend’s feet were soft as a lotus-heart he asked him: “Sir, why are your feet so tender?”

And the fiend replied: “I am under a vow never to touch the ground with my feet until I have washed them.” Soon the Brahman, while meditating a plan of escape, came to a lake. Here the fiend said: “Sir, do not stir from this spot until I come forth from the lake after bathing and worshipping the god.”

Thereupon the Brahman thought: “He will be sure to eat me after his worship. I will hurry away. For he will not follow me with unwashen feet.”

And when he did so, the fiend, not daring to break his vow, did not follow.

“And that is why I say:

A prudent man should always ask,… .

and the rest of it.”

After listening to this, the king summoned the Brahmans and said: “Brahmans, a three-breasted daughter has been born to me. Are any remedial measures to be taken, or not?” And they replied: “O King, listen.

A daughter fitted out with limbs

Too numerous or few,

Will lose character, and will

Destroy her husband, too.

But if the father sees a girl

With triple breast about,

She dooms him to a speedy death

Without a shade of doubt.

“Therefore, O King, shun the sight of her. Give her to anyone who will marry her, but banish him from the country. If this is done, there is no offense to laws human or divine.”

When the king had listened to this opinion, he ordered a proclamation to be made everywhere with beat of drum, as follows: “Hear ye\! There is a three-breasted princess. To anyone who marries her the king will give a hundred thousand gold-pieces, but will exile him.” For a long time this proclamation was made without anyone marrying the princess, who remained in seclusion and grew to young womanhood.

Now there was a blind man in the city, and as companion he had a hunchback named Slow, who guided him with a staff. These two heard the drum and consulted, saying: “In case we touch that drum, we get girl and gold. With the gold our life will be happy. And even if death results from the girl’s deformity, it will put a final end to the wretchedness of poverty. For

Until a mortal’s belly-pot

Is full, he does not care a jot

For love or music, wit or shame,

For body’s care or scholar’s name,

For virtue or for social charm,

For lightness or release from harm,

For godlike wisdom, youthful beauty,

For purity or anxious duty.”

After this consultation, the blind man went and touched the drum saying: “I will marry the girl.” Thereupon the king’s men went and reported: “O King, a certain blind man has touched the drum. Decision rests with the king.”

And the king said: “Listen.

Blind or deaf, of meanest birth,

Leprous may he be;

Let him take the girl and gold

To a far country.”

So the king’s men, following their lord’s command, took the three-breasted princess to the river-bank, married her to the blind man, and gave him the hundred thousand gold-pieces. Then putting them all in a fishing-boat, they said to the fishermen: “Men, take this blind man, with his wife and the hunchback, to a foreign land, and settle them in some town or other.”

So they came to a.foreign country, all three of them. There in a certain town they purchased a house and lived comfortably. The blind man, however, spent all his time dozing on a couch. The hunchback did the housework.

In course of time the princess had an intrigue with the hunchback, and she said: “My beloved, if this blind man happened to be killed, we should live happily together. Please find some poison. I will administer it, will kill him, and will become happy.”

Now one day the hunchback picked up a dead black snake, and joyfully returning home with it, he said to her: “Beloved, I found this black snake. Please cut it up, season it with delicious tidbits, and give it to that eyeless fellow, telling him it is fish. Then he will die in a hurry.” And with this Slow started off for the market.

But she cut up the snake, put it in a kettle with butter-milk, placed it over the fire, and as she was herself occupied with chores about the house, she civilly said to the blind man: “My dear, I got your favorite fish today, and I am cooking them. So while I am busy with other chores, please take the spoon and stir them.” And he was delighted to hear it, stood up at once, licking his chops, took the spoon, and started to stir.

But as he did so, the poisoned steam reached his eyes, and the film began to peel off And he, perceiving its healthful action, intercepted all he could. So his vision cleared, and looking into the kettle, he saw nothing but chopped black snake. And he thought: “Well, what is the meaning of this? She called it fish to my face. But this is chopped snake. I must learn, for certain, whether this is the work of the three-breasted woman or a move to kill me on the part of Slow, or of somebody else.”

With this in mind, he concealed his feelings and behaved like a blind man. Presently Slow returned and without hesitation began to hug the wife, to kiss her, and so on. And the blind man saw it all.

Not finding a knife, he went up to Slow in the old way, wrathfully seized him by the feet, whirled him about his head with every bit of strength he could muster, and dashed him against the chest of the three-breasted woman. And the blow from the hunchback’s body forced the third breast in, while the hunchback, when his hump smashed against her bosom, became straight.

“And that is why I say:

Blind man, hunchback,....

and the rest of it.”

Then the gold-finder said: “Yes, you are quite right in saying that good fortune always comes through the favor of fate. Yet, after all, a man should make fate his own, and not desert prudence, as you did in rejecting my advice.”

With this the gold-finder bade him farewell and started home.

Here ends Book V called “Ill-considered Deeds.” The first verse runs:

Deeds ill-known, ill-recognized,

Ill-accomplished, ill-devised —

Thought of these let no man harbor:

Take a warning from the barber.
