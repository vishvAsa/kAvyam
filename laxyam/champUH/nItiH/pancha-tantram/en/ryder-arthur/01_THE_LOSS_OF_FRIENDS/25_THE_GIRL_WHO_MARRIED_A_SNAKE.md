title = "25 THE GIRL WHO MARRIED A SNAKE"

+++

In Palace City lived a Brahman named Godly, whose childless wife wept bitterly when she saw the neighbors’ youngsters. But one day the Brahman said: “Forget your sorrow, mother dear. See\! When I was offering the sacrifice for birth of children, an invisible being said to me in he clearest words: ‘Brahman, you shall have a son surpassing all mankind in beauty, character, and charm.’ “

When she heard this, the wife felt her heart swell with supreme delight. “I only hope his promises come true,” she said. Presently she conceived, and in course of time gave birth to a snake. When she saw him, she paid no attention to her companions, who all advised her to throw him away. Instead, she took him and bathed him, laid him with motherly tenderness in a large, clean box, and pampered him with milk, fresh butter, and other good things, so that before many days had passed, he grew to maturity.

But one’day the Brahman’s wife was watching the marriage festival of a neighbor’s son, and the tears streamed down her face as she said to her husband: “I know that you despise me, because you do nothing about a marriage festival for my boy.” “My good wife,” answered, he, “am I to go to the depths of the underworld and beseech Vasuki the serpent-king? Who else, you foolish woman, would give his own daughter to this snake?”

There in the house of a kinsman whom he could visit with pleasure since each respected the other’s character, he was hospitably received, was given a bath, food, and the like, and there he spent the night.

Now at dawn, when he paid his respects to his Brahman host and made ready to depart, the other asked him: “What was your purpose in coming hither? And where will your errand lead you?”

To this he replied: “I have come in search of a fit wife for my son.” “In that case,” said his host, “I have a very beautiful daughter, and my own person is yours to command. Pray take her for your son.” So the Brahman took the girl with her attendants and returned to his own place.

But when the people of the country beheld her incomparable opulence of beauty, her supreme loveliness and superhuman graces, their eyes popped out with pleasure, and they said to her attendants: “How can right-thinking persons bestow such a pearl of a girl upon a snake?” On hearing this, all her elderly relatives without exception were troubled at heart, and they said: “Let her be taken from this imp-ridden creature.” But the girl said: “No more of this mockery\! Remember the text:

Do once, once only, these three things:

Once spoken, stands the word of kings;

The speech of saints has no miscarriage;

A maid is given once in marriage.

And again:

All fated happenings, derived

From any former state,

Must changeless stand: the very gods

Endured poor Blossom’s fate.”

Whereupon they all asked in chorus: “Who was this Blossom person?” And the girl told the story of
