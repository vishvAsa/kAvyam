title = "23 SMART, THE JACKAL"

+++

In a part of a forest lived a lion named Thunder-Fang, in a company with three counselors, a wolf, a jackal, and a camel, whose names were Meat-Face, Smart, and Spike-Ear. One day he fought with a furious elephant whose sharp-pointed tusk so tore his body that he withdrew from the world.

Then, suffering from a seven-day fast, his body lean with hunger, he said to his famished advisers: “Round up some creature in the forest, so that, even in my present condition, I may provide needed nourishment for you.” The moment he issued his orders, they roamed the wood, but found nothing.

Thereupon Smart reflected: “If Spike-Ear here were killed, then we should all be nourished for a few days. However, the master is kept from killing him by friendly feeling. In spite of that, my wit will put the master in a frame of mind to kill him. For, indeed,

All understanding may be won,

All things be slain, and all be done,

If mortals have sufficient wit;

For me, I make good use of it.”

After these reflections, he said to Spike-Ear: “Friend Spike-Ear, the master lacks wholesome food, and is starving. If the master goes, our death is also a certain thing. So I have a suggestion for your benefit and the master’s. Please pay attention.” “My good fellow,” said Spike-Ear, “make haste to inform me, so that I may unhesitatingly do as you say. Besides, one earns credit for a hundred good deeds by serving his master.”

And Smart said: “My good fellow, give your own body at 100 per cent interest, so that you may receive a double body, and the master may prolong his life.” On hearing this proposal, Spike-Ear said: “If that is possible, my friend, my body shall be so devoted. Tell the master that this thing should be done. I stipulate only that the Death-God be requested to guarantee the bargain.”

Having made their decision they all went to visit the lion, and Smart said: “O King, we did not find a thing today, and the blessed sun is already near his setting.” On hearing this, the lion fell into deep despondency. Then Smart continued: “O King, our friend Spike-Ear makes this proposal: ‘If you call upon the Death-God to guarantee the bargain, and if you render it back with 100 per cent of interest, then I will give my body.’” “My good fellow,” answered the lion, “yours is a beautiful act. Let it be as you say.” On the basis of this pact, Spike-Ear was struck down by the lion’s paw, his body was torn by the wolf and the jackal, and he died.

Then Smart reflected: “How can I get him all to myself to eat?” With this thought in his mind, he noticed that the lion’s body was smeared with blood, and he said: “Master, you must go to the river to bathe and worship the gods, while I stay here with Meat-Face to guard the food-supply.” On hearing this, the lion went to the river.

When the lion was gone, Smart said to Meat-Face: “Friend Meat-Face, you are starving. You might eat some of this camel before the old master returns. I will make your apologies to the master.” So Meat-Face took the hint, but had only taken a taste when Smart cried: “Drop it, Meat-Face. The master is coming.”

Presently the lion returned, saw that the camel was minus a heart, and wrathfully roared: “Look here\! Who turned this camel into leavings? I wish to kill him, too.” Then Meat-Face peered into Smart’s visage, as much as to say: “Come now\! Say something, so that he may calm down.” But Smart laughed and said: “Come, come

You ate the camel’s heart all by yourself. Why do you look at me?” And Meat-Face, hearing this, fled for his life, making for another country. But when the lion had pursued him a short distance, he turned back, thinking: “He, too, is unguipugnacious. I must not kill him.” At this moment, as fate would have it, there came that way a great camel caravan, heavily laden, making a tremendous jingling with the bells tied to the camels’ necks. And when the lion heard the jingle of the bells, loud even in the distance, he said to the jackal: “My good fellow, find out what this horrible noise may be.”

On receiving this commission, Smart advanced a little in the forest, then darted back, and cried in great excitement: “Run, master\! Run, if you can run\!”

“My good fellow,” said the lion, “why terrify me so? Tell me what it is.” And Smart cried: “Master, the Death-God is coming, and he is in a rage against you because you brought untimely death upon his camel, and had him guarantee the bargain. He intends to make you pay a thousand fold for his camel. He has immense pride in his camels. He also plans to make inquiries about the father and grandfathers of that one. He is coming. He is near at hand.”

When the lion heard this, he, too abandoned the dead camel and scampered for dear life. Whereupon Smart ate the camel bit by bit, so that the meat lasted a long time.

“And that is why I say:

The wise who wrongs another,

Pursuing selfish good,….

and the rest of it.”

Now when Victor was gone, Lively reflected: “What am I to do? Suppose I go elsewhere, then some other merciless creature will kill me, for this is a wild wood. Indeed, when the master is furious, it is not possible even to depart For the proverb says:

Impunity comes not

By fleeing far away:

The long arms of the shrewd

Make careless sinners pay.

“My best course is to approach the lion. He might regard mc as a suppliant, might spare my life.”

Having thus set his mind in order, he started very slowly, with troubled spirit, and when he perceived the lion in the posture foretold by Victor, he sank down at some little distance, thinking:

“Ah, the unfathomable character of kings\! As the proverb says:

‘Tis a house with serpents crawling,

Wood with beasts of prey appalling,

Lotus-pond where blossoms smile

O’er the lurking crocodile,

Spot that sneaking rogues deface

With repeated slanders base-

Timid servant never learns

Whither kingly purpose turns.”

Rusty for his part, perceiving the bull in the attitude predicted by Victor, made a sudden spring at him. And Lively, though his body was torn by sharp claws as formidable as thunderbolts, also scored the lion’s belley with his horns, contrived to break away from him, and stood in fighting posture, ready to gore again.

At this point Cheek perceived that both of them, red as dhak trees in blossom, were intent on killing each other, and he said reproachfully to Victor: “You dunderhead\! In setting these two at enmity, you have done a wicked deed. You have brought trouble and confusion into this entire forest, thus proving your ignorance of the true nature of statecraft. For the saying runs:

Those are counselors indeed,

Wise in statecraft, who succeed

In composing reckless strife

That, unhindered, threatens life:

Those on petty purpose bent,

Keen to visit punishment,

Quick in wrong and folly, bring

Risk to kingdom and to king.

Ah, poor fool\!

Men of true discernment, first

Try conciliation;

For the victories of peace

Suffer no frustration.

As, poor simpleton\! You seek the post of counselor, and are ignorant of the very name of conciliation. Your ambition is vain, since you love harsh measures. As the proverb puts it:

Lord Brahma bids the statesman try

Conciliation first,

Postpone or shun \(it can be done\)

Harsh deeds, of all deeds worst.

Tis neither sun nor flashing gem

Nor fiery spark,

‘Tis peace, from bitter foeman’s hearts

That routs the dark.

And again:

Try peaceful means, not harsh, to make

Your quarrel flit:

Take sugar, not cucumber, for

A bilious fit.

And once again:

The doors that wit unlocks are three-

Peace, shrewd intrigue and bribery;

The fourth device that brings success

In struggle, is plain manliness.

‘Tis womanish, no doubt, to show

Small strength, abundant sense;

But power is merely bestial, if

Without intelligence.

Snake, lion, elephant, and fire,

With water, wind and sun,

Have power. From undirected power

Is little profit won.

“Now if it was overweening pride in being the son of a counselor that has led you to outrage decency, the result will be merely your own ruin. As the proverb says:

What is learning whose attaining

Sees no passion wane, no reigning

Love and self-contrbl?

Does not make the mind a menial,

Finds in virtue no congenial

Path and final goal?

Whose attaining is but straining

For a name, and never gaining

Fame or peace of soul?

“Now in the treatises on the subject statesmanship is subsumed under five heads, to wit: proper inception; resources, human and material; determination of place and time; countermeasures for mischance; and successful accomplishment. At the present moment, the master finds himself in serious peril. So, if you have any such capacity, devise countermeasures for his mischance. For the wisdom of a counselor finds its test in the patching of friendship. Ah, you fool\! That you cannot do, because you have a perverted mind. As the saying goes:

No scamp can further others’ work,

But can deprave it:

The mole uproots the mulberry

But cannot save it.

“After all, the fault is not yours, but rather the master’s, who trusts your words, dull-witted as you are. And the proverb says:

Educating sluggish wit

Kills no pride but fosters it:

In the sunlight others find

Aid to vision; owls go blind.

Education thrusts aside

Man’s fatuity and pride;

If it foster them, who can

Cure the educated man?

Remedies are useless when

Heaven’s nectar poisons men.”

And Cheek, beholding his master in pitiful plight, sank into deep dejection. “Dreadful,” he cried, “dreadful is the penalty the master pays for taking evil counsel\! Indeed, there is wisdom in the verse:

Monarchs who adopt a plan

From the mean and vicious man,

Who refuse to tread the way

That the prudent counsel-they

Enter misadventure’s cage

Where the adversaries rage;

Thence deliverance’s gate

Crowns an issue rugged, strait.

“Fool\! Fool\! All the world seeks the service of a master whose retinue is righteous. How, then, can such an evil counselor as you, who, like a beast, understand nothing but destruction-how can such a one enrich the master with righteous companions? For the proverb says:

Monarchs, ill-advised, repel

Even though they purpose well:

Sweet and placid waters smile,

But beware the crocodile.

“Yet you, I suppose, seeking your own advantage, desire to have the king quite solitary. Ah, fool\! Are you ignorant of the verse?

Kings shine as social beings, not

As solitaries

Whoever wish them lonely are

Their adversaries.

And again:

Draw benefit from comments harsh;

No poison, this:

In flattery see treason, not

True nectar’s bliss.

“And if you are grieved at seeing others happy and prosperous, that, too, is wicked. It is wrong to proceed thus when friends have fulfilled their nature. For

Those who seek, through treason, friends;

Seek, through humbug, righteous ends:

Property by wronging neighbors;

Learning’s wealth by easy labors;

Woman’s love by cruel pride--

These are fools, self-stultified.

Likewise:

The happiness of subjects makes

The monarch gay and brave:

Nay, what would be the dancing sea

With no gem-flashing wave?

“Furthermore, for one who has enjoyed the master’s favor, modesty is peculiarly proper. As the verse puts it:

According to his favored state,

A servant’s modest, humble gait

Is notably appropriate.

“Your character, however, is marked by levity. And the proverb says:

The great are firm, though battered, as before;

Great ocean is not fouled by caving shore:

For petty cause the fickle change and pass;

The gentlest breezes ruffle pliant grass.

“When all is said, it is the master’s fault. For in pursuit of virtue, money, and love, he recklessly takes counsel with one like you-one who lives by the mere pretense of administrative competence, in total ignorance of the six expedients and the four devices for attaining success. Yes, there is wisdom in this:

If kings are satisfied

With servants at their side

Who play a wheedling tongue,

Whose bows are never strung,

Then kingly glory goes

Embracing manlier foes.

“Indeed there is much sense in the story which is summed up in the familiar verse:

The counselor whose name was Strong

Attained his dearest heart’s desire:

He won the favor of his king;

He burned the naked monk with fire.”

“How was that?” asked Victor. And Cheek told the story of
