title = "01 THE WEDGE-PULLING MONKEY"

+++

There was a city in a certain region. In a grove near by, a merchant was having a temple built. Each day at the noon hour the foreman and workers would go to the city for lunch.

Now one day a troop of monkeys came upon the half-built temple. There lay a tremendous anjana-log, which a mechanic had begun to split, a wedge of acacia-wood being thrust in at the top.

There the monkeys began their playful frolics upon tree-top, lofty roof, and woodpile. Then one of them, whose doom was near, thoughtlessly bestrode the log, thinking: “Who stuck a wedge in this queer place?” So he seized it with both hands and started to work it loose. Now what happened when the wedge gave at the spot where his private parts entered the cleft, that, sir, you know without being told.

“And that is why I say that meddling should be avoided by the intelligent. And you know,” he continued, “that we two pick up a fair living just from his leavings.”

“But,” said Victor, “how can you give first-rate service merely from a desire for food with no desire for distinction? There is wisdom in the saying:

In hurting foes and elping friends

The wise perceive the proper ends

Of serving kings. The belly’s call

To answer, is no job at all.

And again:

When many Jives on one depend,

Then life is life indeed:

A crow, with beak equipped, can fill

His belly’s selfish need.

If loving kindness be not shown

To friends and souls in pain,

To teachers, servants, and one’s self,

What use in life, what gain?

A crow will live for many years

And eat the offered grain.

A dog is quite contented if

He gets a meatless bone,

A dirty thing with gristle-strings

And marrow-fat alone—

And not enough of it at that

To still his belly’s moan.

The lion scorns the jackal, though

Between his paws, to smite

The elephant. For everyone,

However sad his plight,

Demands the recompense that he

Esteems his native right.

Dogs wag their tails and fawn and roll,

Bare mouth and belly, at your feet:

Bull-elephants show self-esteem,

Demand much coaxing ere they eat.

A tiny rill

Is quick to fill,

And quick a mouse’s paws:

So seedy men Are grateful, when

There is but little cause.

For if there be no mind

Debating good and ill,

And if religion send

No challenge to the will,

If only greed be there

For some material feast,

How draw a line between

The man-beast and the beast?

Or more accurately yet:

Since cattle draw the plow

Through rough and level soil,

And bend their patient necks

To heavy wagons’ toil,

Are kind, of sinless birth,

And find in grass a feast,

How can they be compared

With any human beast?”

“But at present,” said Cheek, “we two hold no job at court. So why meddle?” “My dear fellow,” said Victor, “after a little the jobless man does hold a job. As the saying goes:

The jobless man is hired

For careful serving;

The holder may be fired,

If undeserving.

No haracter moves up or down

At others’ smile or others’ frown;

But honor or contempt on earth

Will follow conduct’s inner worth.

And once more:

It costs an effort still

To carry stones uphill;

They tumble in a trice:

So virtue, and so vice.”

“Well,” said Cheek, “what do you wish to imply?” And Victor answered: “You see, our master is frightened, and he does not know what to do.” “How can you be sure of that?” asked Cheek, and Victor said: “Isn’t it plain?

An ox can understand, of course,

The spoken word; a driven horse

Or elephant, exerts his force;

But men of wisdom can infer

Unuttered thought from features’ stir--

For wit rewards its worshiper.

And again:

From feature, gesture, gait,

From twitch, or word,

From change in eye or face

Is thought inferred.

So by virtue of native intelligence I intend to get him into my power this very day.”

“Why,” said Cheek, “you do not know how to make yourself useful to a superior. So tell me. How can you establish power over him?”

“And why, my good fellow, do I not know how to make myself useful?” said Victor. “The saintly poet Vyasa has sung the entry of the Pandu princes into Virata’s court. From his poem I learned the whole duty of a functionary. You heard the proverb:

No burden enervates the strong;

To enterprise no road is long;

The well-informed all pountries range;

To flatterers no man is strange”

But Cheek objected: “He might perhaps despise you for forcing yourself into a position that does not belong to you.” “Yes,” said Victor, “there is point in that. However, I am also a judge of occasions. And there are rules, as follows:

The Lord of Learning, speaking to

A false occasion,

Will meet with hatred, and of course

Lack all persuasion.

And again:

The favorite’s business comes to be

A sudden source of king’s ennui,

When he is thoughtful, trying scents,

Retiring, or in conference.

And once again:

On hours of talk or squabbling rude.

Of physic, barber, flirting, food,

A gentleman does not intrude

Let everyone be cautious

In palaces of kings;

And let not students rummage

In their professor’s things:

For naughty meddlers suffer

Destruction swift and sure,

Like evening candles, lighted

In houses of the poor.

Or put it this way:

On entering a palace,

Adjust a modest dress;

Go slowly, bowing lowly

In timely humbleness:

And sound he kingly temper,

And kingly whims no less.

Or this way;

Though ignorant and common,

Unworth the honoring,

Men win to royal favor

By standing near the king:

For kings and vines and maidens

To nearest neighbors cling.

And once again:

The servant in his master’s face

Discerns the signs of wrath and grace,

And though the master jerk and tack,

The servant slowly mounts his back.

And finally:

The brave, the learned, he who wins

To bureaucratic power--

These three, alone of all mankind,

Can pluck earth’s golden flower.

“Now let me inform you how power is gained by dancing attendance on a master.

Win the friendly counselors,

To the monarch dear,

Win persuasive speaker; so

Gain the royal ear.

On the undiscerning mob

‘Tis not wise to toil:

No man reaps a harvest by

Plowing barren soil.

Serve a king of merit, though

Friendless, destitute;

After some delay, you pluck

Long-enduring fruit.

Hate your master, and you fill

Servant’s meanest state:

Not discerning whom to serve,

Tis yourself you hate.

Treat the dowager, the queen,

And the king-to-be,

Chaplain, porter, counselor,

Most obsequiously.

One who seeks the van in fights,

In the palace clings,

In the city walks behind,

Is beloved of kings.

One who flatters when addressed,

Does the proper things,

Acts without expressing doubts,

Is beloved of kings.

One, the royal gifts of cash

Prudently who flings,

Wearing gifts of garments, he

Is beloved of kings.

One who never makes reply

That is master stings,

Never boisterously laughs,

Is beloved of kings.

One who never hearkens to

Queenly whispering,

In the women’s quarters dumb,

Is beloved of kings.

One who, even in distress,

Never boasts and sings

Of his master’s favor, he

Is beloved of kings.

One who hates his master’s foe,

Loves his friend, and brings

Pain or joy to either one,

Is beloved of kings.

One who never disagrees,

Blames, or pulls the strings

Of intrigue with enemies,

Is beloved of kings.

One who finds in battle, peace

Free from questionings.

Thinks of exile as of home,

Is beloved of kings.

One who thinks of dice as death.

Wine as poison-stings,

Others’ wives as statues, he

Is beloved of kings.”

“Well,” said Cheek, “When you come into his presence, what do you intend to say first? Please tell me that.” And Victor replied:

“Answers, after speech begins,

Further answers breed,

As a seed, with timely rain,

Ripens other seed.

And besides:

A clever servant shows his master

The gleam of triumph or disaster

From good or evil courses springing,

And shows him wit, decision-bringing.

The man possessing such a wit

Should magnify and foster it;

Thereby he earns a livelihood

And public honor from the good.

And there is a saying:

Let anyone who does not seek

His master’s fall, unbidden speak;

So act at least the excellent:

The other kind are different.”

“But,” said Cheek, “kings are hard to conciliate. There is a saying:

In sensuous coil

And heartless toil,

In sinuous course

And armored forc,

In savage harms

That yield to charms-

In all these things

Are snakes like kings.

Uneven, rough,

And high enough-

Yet low folk roam

Their flanks as home

And wild things haunt

Them, hungry, gaunt-

In all these things

Are hills like kings.

The things that claw, and the things that gore

Are unreliable things;

And so is a man with a sword in his hand,

And rivers, and women, and kings.”

“Quite true,” said Victor. “However:

The clever man soon penetrates

The subject’s mind and captivates.

Cringe, and flatter him when angry,

Love his friend and hate his foe;

Duly advertise his presents-

Trust no magic-win him so.

And yet:

If a man excel in action,

Learning, fluent word,

Make yourself his humble servant

While his power is stirred,

Quick to leave him at the moment

When he grows absurd.

Plant your words where profit lies:

Whiter cloth takes faster dyes.

Till you know his power and manhood,

Effort has no scope:

Moonlight’s glitter vainly rivals

Himalaya’s slope.”

And Cheek replied: “If you have made up your mind, then seek the feet of the king. Blest be your journeyings. May your purpose be accomplished.

Be heedful in the presence of the king;

We also to your health and fortune cling.”

Then Victor bowed to his friend, and went to meet Rusty.

Now when Rusty saw Victor approaching, he said to the doorkeeper: “Away with your reed of office\!This is an old acquaintance, the counselors son Victor. He has free entrance. Let him come in. He belongs to the second circle.” So Victor entered, bowed to Rusty, and sat down on the seat indicated to him.

Then Rusty extended a right paw adorned with claws as formidable as thunderbolts, and said respectfully: “Do you enjoy health? Why has so long a time passed since you were last visible?” And Victor replied: “Even though my royal master has no present need of me, still I ought to report at the proper time. For there is nothing that may not render service to a king. As the saying goes:

To clean a tooth or scratch an ear

A straw may serve a king:

A man, with speech and action, is

A higher kind of thing.

“Besides, we who are ancestral servants of our royal master, follow him even in disasters. For us there is no other course. Now the proverb says:

Set in fit position each

Gem or serving-man;

No tiaras on the toes,

Just because you can.

Servants leave the kings who their

Qualities ignore,

Even kings of lofty line,

Wealthy, served of yore.

Lacking honor from their equals,

Jobless*, declasse*,

Servants give their master notice

That they will not stay.

And again;

If set in tin, a gem that would

Adorn a golden frame,

Will never scream nor fail to gleam,

Yet tells its wearer’s shame.

The king who reads a servant’s mind-

Dull, faithless, faithful, wise-

May servants find of every kind

For every enterprise.

“And as for my master’s remark: ‘It is long since you were last visible,’ pray hear the reason of that:

Where just distinction is not drawn

Between the left and right,

The self-respecting, if they can,

Will quickly take to flight.

If masters no distinction make

Among their servants, then

They lose the zealous offices

Of energetic men.

And in a market where it seems

That no distinctions hold

Between red-eye and ruby, how

Can precious gems be sold?

There must be bonds of union

In all their dealings, since

No prince can lack his servants

Nor servants lack a prince.

“Yet the nature of the servant also depends on the master’s quality. As the saying goes:

In case of horse or book or sword,

Of woman, man or lute or word,

The use or uselessness depends

On qualities the user lends.

“And another point. You do wrong to despise me because I am a jackal. For

Sink comes from worms, and gold from stone;

From cow’s hair sacred grass is grown;

The water-lily springs from mud;

From cow-dung sprouts the lotus-bud;

The moon its rise from ocean takes;

And gems proceed from hoods of snakes;

From cows’ bile yellow dyestuffs come;

And fire in wood is quite at home:

The worthy, by display of worth,

Attain distinction, not by birth.

And again:

Kill, although domestic born,

Any hurtful mouse:

Bribe an alien cat who will

Help to clean the house.

And once again:

How use the faithful, lacking power?

Or strong, who evil do?

But me, O King, you should not scorn,

For I am strong and true.

Scorn not the wise who penetrate

Truth’s universal law;

They are not men to be restrained

By money’s petty straw:

When beauty glistens on their cheeks

By trickling ichor lent,

Bull-elephants feel lotus-chains

As no impediment.”

“Oh,” said Rusty, “you must not say such things. You are our counselor’s son, an old retainer.” “O King,” said Victor, “there is something that should be said.” And the king replied: “My good fellow, reveal what is in your heart.”

Then Victor began: “My master set out to take water. Why did he turn back and camp here?” And Rusty, concealing his inner feelings, said: “Victor, it just happened so.” “O King,” said the jackal, “if it is not a thing to disclose, then let it be.

Some things a man should tell his wife,

Some things to friend and some to son;

All these are trusted. He should not

Tell everything to everyone.”

Hereupon Rusty reflected: “He seems trustworthy. I will tell him what I have in mind. For the proverb says.

You find repose, in sore disaster,

By telling things to powerful master,

To honest servant, faithful friend,

Or wife who loves you till the end.

Friend Victor, did you hear a great voice in the distance?” “Yes master, I did,” said Victor. “What of it?”

And Rusty continued: “My good fellow, I intend to leave this forest.” “Why?” said Victor. “Because,” said Rusty, “there has come into our forest some prodigious creature, from whom we hear this great voice. His nature must correspond to his voice, and his power to his nature.”

“What\!” said Victor. “Is our master frightened by a mere voice? You know the proverb:

Water undermines the dikes;

Love dissolves when malice strikes;

Secrets melt when babblings start;

Simple words melt dastard hearts.

So it would be improper if our master abruptly left the forest which was won by his ancestors and has been so long in the family. For they say:

Wisely move one foot; the other

Should its vantage hold;

Till assured of some new dwelling,

Do not leave the old.

“Besides, many kinds of sounds are heard here. Yet they are nothing but noises, not a warning of danger. For example, we hear the sounds made by thunder, wind among the reeds, lutes, drums, tambourines, conch-shells, bells, wagons, banging doors, machines, and other things. They are nothing to be afraid of. As the verse says:

If a king be brave, however

Fierce the foe and grim,

Sorrows of humiliation

Do not wait for him.

And again:

Bravest bosoms do not falter,

Fearing heaven’s threat:

Summer dries the pools; the Indus

Rises, greater yet.

And once again:

Mothers bear on rare occasions

To the world a chief,

Glad in luck and brave in battle,

Undepressed in grief.

And yet again:

Do not act as does the grass-blade,

Lacking honest pride,

Drooping low in feeble meanness,

Lightly brushed aside.

My master must take this point of view and reinforce his resolution, not fear a mere sound. As the saying goes:

I thought at first that it was full

Of fat; I crept within

And there I did not find a thing

Except some wood and skin.”

“How was that?” asked Rusty. And Victor told the story of
