On a part of a mountain a hen-parrot brought two chicks into the world. These chicks were caught by a hunter when the mother had left the nest to search for food. One of them — since fate decreed it — contrived to escape, while the other was kept in a cage and taught to speak.

To foes or sense, not foolish friends,

Tis wiser far to cling:

The robber for his victims died;

“How was that?” asked Victor. And Cheek told two stories, called
