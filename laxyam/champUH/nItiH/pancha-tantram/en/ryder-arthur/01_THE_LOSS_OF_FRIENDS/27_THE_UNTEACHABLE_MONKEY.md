In a part of a forest was a troop of monkeys who found a firefly one winter evening when they were dreadfully depressed. On examining the insect, they believed it to be fire, so lifted it with care, covered it with dry grass and leaves, thrust forward their arms, sides, stomachs, and chests, scratched themselves, and enjoyed imagining that they were warm. One of the arboreal creatures in particular, being especially chilly, blew repeatedly and with concentrated attention on the firefly.

Thereupon a bird named Needle-Face, driven by hostile fate to her own destruction, flew down from her tree and said to the monkey: “My dear sir, do not put yourself to unnecessary trouble.

‘Like-born’ like the father lives;

‘Better-born’ more nobly acts;

‘Worse-born’ morally subtracts.

“Ah, there is wisdom in the saying:

By whom far-piercing wisdom or

Great wealth or power is won

To lift the family, in him

A mother has a son.

Again:

A merely striking beauty

Is not so hard to find;

A rarer gem is wisdom,

Far-reaching power of mind.

“Yes, there is sense in the story:

Right-Mind was one, and Wrong-Mind two:

I know the tale by heart:

The son in smoke made father choke

By being supersmar.”

“How was that?” asked Victor. And Cheek told the story of
