BOOK II





THE WINNING OF FRIENDS

Here, then, begins Book II, called “The Winning of Friends.” The first verse runs:

The mouse and turtle, deer and crow,

Had first-rate sense and learning; so-,

Though money failed and means were few,

They quickly put their purpose through.

“How was that?” asked the princes. And Vishnushaman told the following story.

In the southern country is a city called Maidens’ Delight. Not far away was a very lofty banyan tree with mighty trunk and branches, which gave refuge to all creatures. As the verse puts it:

Blest be the tree whose every part

Brings joy to many a creature’s heart—

Its green roof shelters birds in rows,

While deer beneath its shadow doze;

Its flowers are sipped by tranquil bees,

And insects throng its cavities,

While monkeys in familiar mirth

Embrace its trunk. That tree has worth;

But others merely cumber earth.

In the tree lived a crow named Swift. One morning he started toward the city in search of food. But he saw a hunter who lived in the neighborhood and who was already near the tree, approaching to trap birds. He was hideous in person, flat of hand and foot, bare to the calf of the leg, dreadfully ugly of complexion, had bloodshot eyes, was accompanied by dogs, wore his hair in a knot, carried snare and club in his hand — why spin it out? He seemed a second god of destruction, noose in hand; the incarnation of evil; the heart of unrighteousness; the teacher of every sin; the bosom friend of death.

When Swift saw him, he was disturbed in spirit and reflected: “What does he mean to do, the sinner? To hurt me? Or has he some other purpose?” And he clung to the hunter’s heels, being filled with curiosity.

Now the hunter picked a spot, spread a snare, scattered grain, and hid not far away. But the birds who lived there were held in check by Swift’s counsel, regarded the rice-grains as deadly poison, and did not peep.

At this juncture a dove-king named Gay-Neck, with hundreds of dove retainers, was wandering in search of food, and spied the rice-grains from afar. In spite of dissuasion from Swift, he greedily sought to eat them and alighted in the great snare. The moment he did so, he and his retainers were caught in the meshes. Nor should he be blamed. It happened through hostile fate. As the saying goes:

How did Ravan fail to feel

That ‘tis wrong, a wife to steal?

How did Rama fail to see

Golden deer could never be?

How Yudhishthir fail to know

Gambling brings a train of woe?

Clutching evil dims the sense,

Darkening intelligence.

And again:

When once the mind is gripped by fate,

The judgment even of the great,

In mortal meshes fettered, wends

To unintended, crooked ends.

So the hunter gleefully lifted his club and ran forward. Then Gay-Neck and his retainers, seeing him advancing, were distressed by their disastrous position in the snare. But the king, with much presence of mind, said to the doves: “Have no fear, my friends.

For Provided judgment does not fail,

Whatever the distress,

Men reach the farther shore of woe,

And rest in happiness.

“We must all agree in purpose, must fly up in unison, and carry the snare away. This is not possible without united action. For death befalls those of disunited purpose. As the saying goes:

Bharunda birds will teach you why

The disunited surely die;

For, single-bellied, double-necked,

They took a diet incorrect.”

“How was that?” asked the doves. And Gay-Neck told the story of
