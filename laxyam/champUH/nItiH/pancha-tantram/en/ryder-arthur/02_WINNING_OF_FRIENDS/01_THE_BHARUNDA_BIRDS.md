title = "01 THE BHARUNDA BIRDS"

+++

By a certain lake in the world lived birds called “bharunda birds.” They had one belly and two necks apiece.

While one of these birds was sauntering about, his first neck found some nectar. Then the second said: “Give me half.” And when the first refused, the second neck angrily picked up poison somewhere and ate it. As they had one belly, they died.

“And that is why I say:

Bharunda birds will teach you why,... ....

and the rest of it. Thus union is strength.”

When the doves heard this, being eager to live, they united their efforts to carry the snare away, flew just an arrow-shot into the air, formed a canopy in the sky, and proceeded without fear.

When the hunter saw the snare carried away by birds, he looked up in amazement, thinking: “This is unprecedented.” And he recited a stanza:

So long as they agree, they may

Carry the fatal snare away;

But they will quickly disagree,

And then those birds belong to me.

With this in mind, he started to pursue. And when Gay-Neck perceived the savage pursuer and recognized his purpose, with judgment unconfused, he started to fly over regions rough with hills and trees.

And Swift in turn, astonished both by Gay-Neck’s prudent conduct and the hunter’s cruel purpose, repeatedly shifted his glance, looking now up, now down, forgot his concern for food, and followed the flock of doves with keenest interest. For he was thinking: “What will this noble soul do next? And what this villain?” At last the hunter, observing that the flock of doves was protected by the roughness of the paths, turned back in disappointment, saying:

“What hall not be, will never be;

What, Shall be, follows painlessly;

The thing your fingers grasp, will flit,

If fate has predetermined it.

And again:

If fate be hostile, even gains

Acquired no man can hold;

They go, and take his other wealth,

Like hoards of magic gold.

“For, to say nothing of getting birds to eat, I have actually lost the snare which was my means of supporting the family.”

Now when Gay-Neck saw that the hunter had turned back hopeless, he said to the doves: “See\! We may travel quietly. The villainous hunter has turned back. This being so, our best plan is to fly to the city Maidens’ Delight. For in its northeastern quarter dwells a mouse named Gold, a dear friend of mine. He will cut our bonds in a hurry. He is quite competent to set us free from our trouble.”

So they all did as he said, for they were eager to find the mouse named Gold. And when they reached the hole which he had converted into a fortress, they alighted. Now previously

The mouse, in social ethics skilled,

Saw danger coming. Then

He built and was residing in

A hundred-gated den.

This being so, Gold was alarmed at the whir of birds’ wings, darted along one path in his fortress-den until just beyond reach of a cat’s paw, and remained on the *qui vive*, wondering what it meant. But Gay-Neck took his stand at a gate of the den, and said: “My dear Gold, pray hasten to me. See what a plight I am in.”

Thereupon Gold, still within his fortress, said: “My good sir, who are you? What is your errand? And of what nature is your misfortune? Please inform me.” And Gay-Neck answered: “Why, my name is Gay-Neck. I am king of the doves, and a friend of yours. Hasten to me.” At this the mouse felt a quiver in his body and a thrill in his soul. He hastened forth, saying:

If daily to his home

The friends who love him come,

And coming, bring delight,

To eyes that kindle bright,

A man has found the whole

Of life within his soul.

Then, observing that Gay-Neck and his retainers were caught in a snare, he sadly said: “My good friend, what is this, and whence? Tell me.”

“My good friend,” answered Gay-Neck, “why do you ask me? For you know it well. As the proverb says:

Whence, what, by whom, how long, when, where,

And how deserved is good or ill,

Thence, that, by him, so long, then, there,

And so it comes. Fate has its will.

And again:

The peacock seems the world to view

From thousand eyes that mock the hue

Of some bright water-lily;

When fear of death beclouds his mind,

His conduct is of one born blind;

He sinks disheartened, silly.

A hundred leagues and twenty-five

The vulture spies his meat.

But-fate decreeing-fails to see

The snare before his feet.

And again:

Snake, bird, and elephant are caged;

The moon and sun go through eclipse,

The wise are poor: all this I see,

And think how dreadfully fate grips.

And once again:

The birds that in the sky securely soar,

Endure calamities;

While fish are plucked by men from ocean’s floor

In far, unsounded seas.

Why speak of virtue here or moral harm?

What stance could help or mar?

‘Tis Time that stretches forth a fatal arm,

And seizes from afar.”

When Gay-Neck had spoken thus, Gold began to cut his bonds, but Gay-Neck checked him, saying: “My good friend, this is wrong. Please do not cut my bonds first, but my followers’ “Now Gold grew angry at this and said: “Come now\! You are mistaken. For servants follow the master.” “No, no, my good friend,” said Gay-Neck. “All these poor creatures left others to take service with me. Shall I fail to show them this petty honor? You know the proverb:

The king who offers honor to

His followers beyond their due,

Has servants glad who never quail,

Not even should his money fail.

And again:

Through trust, the root of happy power,

A creature wins to kingship’s flower,

While lions, born to kingship, must

As tyrants govern, lacking trust.

“Besides, after cutting my bonds, you might toothache. Or that villainous hunter might return. should surely plunge to hell. As the proverb says:

A king who is content to know

That loyal servants suffer woe,

Will later go to hell, but first

Will see his earthly projects burst.”

“Yes,” said Gold, “I am well aware of this royal duty. It was to test you that I said what I did. Now I will cut the bonds of all, and you will have in them a numerous retinue. For the proverb says:

The king who mercifully grants

Due share in all good circumstance

To serving-folk, may fitly rise

The triple world to supervise.”

After making these observations, Gold cut the bonds of all, then said to Gay-Neck: ‘’Now, my friend, you are free to go home.” So Gay-Neck went home with his retinue. Yes, there is wisdom in the saying:

Because a man can gain his ends,

Though difficult, with aid of friends,

Get friends, and feel those friends to be

Integral with prosperity.

Now Swift, who had followed the whole matter of Gay-Neck’s capture and release, was filled with astonishment, and he thought: “What intelligence has this Gold\! What capacity\! What an ingenious fortress\! It would therefore be wise for me also to make friends with Gold. Even though I am of a suspicious temperament, confiding in nobody, even if I am too clever to be overreached by anybody, even so I should win a friend. For the proverb says:

Even the self-sufficient should

Get friends, and seek a greater good:

The ocean fears no diminution,

Yet waits Arcturus’ contribution.”

After these reflections, he flew down from his tree, approached the gate of the den, and called out — for he had previously heard the name of Gold: “Gold, my dear sir, pray come out.”

And Gold, hearing this, reflected: “Is this perhaps some other dove who, still somewhat entangled, is addressing me?” And he said: “Who are you, sir?” “I am a crow,” was the answer. “My name is Swift.”

On hearing this, Gold hugged a far corner and said: “My very dear sir, please leave this neighborhood.” “But,” replied the crow, “I have come to see you on weighty business. Please grant me an interview.”

“I see no advantage in making your acquaintance,” said Gold. “But,” said the crow, “I feel great confidence in you — the result of seeing how Gay-Neck was relieved of bonds through your exertions. I too may possibly be caught some day and find deliverance through you. Please enter into friendship with me.”

“Sir,” answered Gold, “you eat, and I am food. How can I feel friendship for you? You have heard the saying:

The dull think inequalities

In strength no fatal blocks

To friendship. True—but they are dull,

And public laughingstocks.

Please begone.”

“Look\!” said the crow. “Here I perch at the gate of your den. If you do not make friends with me, I shall starve to death.” “But,” said Gold, “how can I make friends with you, with an enemy? For the proverb says:

Make no truce, however snug,

With foemen dire:

Water, even boiling hot,

Will quench a fire.”

“Why,” said the crow, “you do not even know me by sight. Why should there be strife? Why say a thing so little to the purpose?”

“Sir,” said Gold, “strife is of two kinds, natural and incidental. Now you are in natural strife with me. And the saying goes:

By incidental means one ends

An incidental strife,

And quickly. Nature’s kind endures

Until the loss of life.”

“Sir,” said the crow, “I should like to learn the characteristic quality of each kind.” “Well,” said the mouse, “incidental strife springs from a specific cause, and can therefore be removed by rendering an appropriate service. But strife rooted in nature never disappears. Thus there is enduring strife between mungoose and snake — herbivorous creatures and those armed with claws — water and fire — gods and devils — dogs and cats — rival wives — lions and elephants — hunter and deer — crow and owl — scholar and numskull — wife and harlot —saint and sinner. In these cases, nobody belonging to anybody has been killed by anybody, yet they fight to the death.”

“But this is senseless,” said the crow. “Listen to me.

For cause a man becomes a friend;

For cause grows hostile. So

The prudent make a friend of him,

And never make a foe.”

“But,” said Gold, “what commerce can there be between you and me? Listen to the kernel of social ethics:

Whoever trusts a faithless friend

And twice in him believes,

Lays hold on death as certainly

As when a mule conceives.

And again:

A lion took the life of Panini,

Grammar’s most famous name:

A tusker madly crushed sage Jaimini

Of metaphysic fame;

And Pingal, metric’s boast, was slaughtered by

A seaside crocodile —

What sense for scholarly attainments high

Have beasts besotted, vile?”

“True enough,” said the crow. “But listen to this:

The beasts and birds as friends are won

For cause; plain folks, for service done;

And silly souls, for greed or fright —

But good men are your friends at sight.

And again:

Like pots of clay, the wicked friend

Is quick to smash and hard to mend:

Like pots of gold the righteous-flash,

As quick to mend, as hard to smash.

And yet again:

Each segment of a sugar-cane

Beyond the tip, is sweeter

The friendship of the good is so —

The other kind grows bitter.

Now I assure you that I am upright. Besides, I will reassure you by taking oaths.”

But Gold replied: “I have no confidence in your oaths. There is a saying:

Though a foe be bound by oaths,

Trust him none the more

Indra struck the demon down,

Spite of oaths galore.

And again:

Even gods must try to lull

Foes with measures mild:

Indra, soothing Diti first,

Smote her unborn child.

Through a narrow crevice slip

Enemies who gloat,

Bringing slow destruction, like

Water in a boat.

If, relying on their means,

Men confide in foes,

Or in wives whose love is lost,

Life abruptly goes“

To this Swift found no rejoinder, and he thought: “What an eminent intelligence he has in the field of social ethics\! Yet for that very reason I crave his friendship.” And he said:

“True friendship, sir, is an affair

Of seven words, the wise declare;

I’ve forced you, then, to be a friend —

So hear my pleading to the end.

Now grant me your friendship. If you refuse, I shall starve where I stand.”

And Gold reflected: “He is not unintelligent. His speech proves it.

None lacking shrewdness flatter well

None but a lover plays the swell;

No saints are found in judgment seats;

No clear, straightforward speaker cheats.

So I must certainly grant him my friendship.”

Having made up his mind to this, he said to the crow: “My dear sir, you have won my confidence. But it was necessary first to test your intelligence. Now I lay my head in your lap.” With this he started to come forth, but when scarcely halfway out, he stopped again. And Swift said: “Do you cherish even yet some reason for mistrusting me? I see you do not leave your fortress.”

“I have no fear of you,” said Gold, “for I have examined your mind. But if I gave my confidence, I might perhaps meet death through other friends of yours.” Then the crow spoke:

Friends purchased at the price of death

To other friends and true,

One should avoid, like worthless corn

Where finest rice-plants grew.

Hearing this, Gold hastened forth, and there was a civil greeting on both sides. After a moment Swift said to Gold: “I will not keep you longer outdoors. I am in search of food.” With this he left his friend and flew into thick jungle where he found a wild buffalo that a tiger had killed. Of this he ate his fill, then returned to Gold, carrying a lump of meat red as a dhak-blossom. And he cried: “Come out, my dear Gold\! Come out\! Enjoy this meat that I have brought.”

Now Gold, with sedulous forethought, had constructed a great heap of corn and rice for his friend’s use. And he said. “My dear friend, pray enjoy this rice which I have provided to the best of my ability.” So each was highly pleased with the other, and they ate in order to manifest kindly feeling. This, indeed, is the seed of friendship. As the verse puts it:

Six things are done by friends:

To take, and give again;

To listen, and to talk;

To dine, to entertain.

No friendship ever comes

Without some kindly deed:

The very gods respond

To gifts they have decreed.

As soon as presents cease,

So soon does friendship die;

The calf deserts the cow

Whose udder has gone dry.

So, to make a long story short:

The mouse and crow became

Such friends as never fail,

Enduring, hard to split

As flesh and finger nail.

Indeed, the mouse was so captivated by the crow’s attentions that he grew confident to the point of feeling quite at home between his wings

Now one day the crow appeared with tears filling his eyes, and sobs choked him as he said: “My very dear Gold, I have grown dissatisfied with this country. I intend to travel.” “My dear friend,” said Gold, “what cause have you for discontent?”

“Listen^ my friend,” said the crow. “There has been a dreadful drought in this country, so that all the city people, driven by famine, not only cease to give the birds a few mere crumbs, but actually set bird-traps in every house. To be sure. I have not been caught, for further life is appointed me. Yet this is why I shed tears — for I think of foreign travel. This is why I plan to visit another land.” “Then tell me where you plan to go,” said Gold. And Swift replied:

“In the far south is a great lake in the .heart of the jungle. There lives a turtle named Slow, a bosom friend of mine, dearer even than you are. He will give me bits of fish, a digestible diet. In his society I shall be happy, enjoying the delight of conversation spiced with wit. Besides, I cannot behold such slaughter of birds. For the proverb says:

Blest are they who do not see

Death upon the family,

Friend in trouble, stolen wife,

Ruin of the nation’s life.”

“Considering the circumstances,” said Gold, “I will accompany you. I, too, have a great sorrow.” “Of what nature?” asked Swift. “Oh,” said Gold, “it is a long story. When we get there, I will tell you in detail.”

“But,” said the crow, “I travel in the air, you on the ground. How will you accompany me?” And Gold answered: “If you feel concern for the preservation of my life, mount me on your back and carry me very gently.”

At this the crow was delighted and said: “If that is possible, then I am blest indeed. There is none more blest than I. Let it be done. For I know the eight flights, Full-Flight and the rest. Thus I shall carry you in comfort.”

“My friend,” said Gold; “I should like to know the flights by name.” And the crow recited:

Full-Flight, Full-Flight, and the Rise,

Great-Flight, and the Curve likewise,

Horizontal, Downward-Flight;

Number eight is called the Light.

After listening to this, Gold mounted the crow, who set off at Full-Flight. And very gently he brought his friend to the lake.

Thereupon Slow saw a mouse riding a crow, and wondering who he might be, plopped into the water — for he was a judge of occasions. And Swift, after depositing Gold in a hole in a tree on the bank, perched on the tip of a twing and called in a piercing tone: “Friend Slow\! Come here\! I am your crow friend. After long absence I have come, my heart filled with longing. Come, embrace me. For the saying runs:

Bring sandalwood or camphor? No\!

Nor even flakes of cooling snow;

All are not worth the sixteenth part

Of rest upon a friendly heart.”

When he heard this, Slow made a narrow inspection, then, with a quiver of delight and with eyes swimming in joyful tears, he hurriedly scrambled from the water, saying: “I did not know you. I am much to blame. Forgive me.” And when Swift flew down from the tree, he embraced him.

So the two, after exchanging embraces, thrilled with delight, and sitting beneath the tree told each other their adventures during the long separation. Gold also, with a bow to Slow, sat down there. And Slow, spying him, said to Swift: “Tell me, who is this mouse? And why did you mount him, your natural food, on your back and bring him hither?”

And Swift replied: “Ah, he is a mouse named Gold, a friend of mine, almost my second life. To make a short story of it:

His virtues, like the streams of rain

Or stars that dot the sky Or like the grains of dust on earth

All numbering defy; Yes, mathematics fails to count

His lofty virtues through; Yet he, in deep dejection sunk,

Has come to visit you.”

“And what,” said Slow, “is the cause of his gloom?” “That,” said the crow, “I asked him yonder. But he put me off, saying: ‘It is a long story. I will tell you when we get there.’ Now, my very dear Gold, pray tell us both the cause of your gloom.”

And Gold told the story of
